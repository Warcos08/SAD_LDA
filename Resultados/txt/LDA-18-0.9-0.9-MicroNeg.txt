The Road to Rome is an expansion pack forBattlefield: 1942(BF1942). It covers the Italian campaign. It comes with 6 new maps and two new armies (French and Italians). These armies can only be used on certain maps. The expansion also has an assortment of new weapons and vehicles which again are only for use on certain maps. These includes for the Americans M3 Grant (medium tank) and M3 GMC (tank destroyer/mobile artillery), for the British the Mosquito (bomber) and the 25pdr (stationary AT gun), for the Italians the M11-39 Carro Armato (medium tank), and for the Germans the Sturmgeschutz (tank destroyer),PAK75 (stationary AT gun), and the BF 110 (fighter/bomber). Two infantry assault weapons include the British Sten SMG and the Italian Breda Modello 30. The maps are fun and fairly well balanced. I would also note that even though this is very old title there is still an active multiplayer community. I was able to jump right into a multiplayer game with no lag. However, there are very few servers that actually play the expansions.The biggest question is really is it worth getting. If you already have BF1942, I wouldn't bother unless you are a diehard fan.  But if you are looking at getting  BF1942 then getBattlefield 1942: World War II Anthologywhich comes with this expansion andBattlefield 1942: Secret Weapons of WWII Expansion Packor getBattlefield 1942: The Complete Collectionwhich comes with both expansions andBattlefield: Vietnam.

Further playing of C&C3; after my review of it, and continued playing of this can pretty much confirm my feelings.Kane has apparently returned; twice.  Or three times.  Maybe seventeen.  The campaign is all Nod, and skips twice; once taking place before C&C3; campaign, once taking place during it, and once taking place 5 years later.As masterfully rapturing as Joseph Kucan is at portraying Kane to a degree where you stare him right in the eyes and never blink, the story he's given here reeks of staleness, as in concert with the C&C3; Nod campaign, you begin to think Kane is a two-trick pony whose plans always consist of preaching to his "children" and making them feel happy and loved, then making them do stupid things to completely eviscerate any advantage over GDI they may have had, or butcher thousands of their own soldiers pointlessly, as nothing more than "tests of faith".  It's on display here a few more times from the C&C3; campaign.Kane seemingly has no real plan in this expansion pack; it changes as frequently and readily as the wind, and there's always someone new to betray him, because apparently all Kane likes to do is push his "children" until they say no, and he kills them for treachery.  The plots for the expansion pack are rather like TNA Wrestling booking; neither one has much connection to the other, and seem to have been randomly hatched out of convenience.The first act of the story is obvious in Kane trying to reunite Nod and strengthen it secretly.  The second act involves you, as the computer system LEGION, doing random things in the midst of the original C&C3; campaign, as well as some extraneous work for Alexa.Spoilers follow.Act 3 steers wildly off-course, and seems almost to retcon the entire events of the C&C3; campaign.  Whereas C&C3; ended with Nod having secured an alien tower to go through and explore the universe, Act 3 here is 5 years after that, and Nod is still on Earth, and Kane is somehow HAPPY that virtually all his generals have been killed and GDI pretty much controls the planet once again.Also, they apparently lost the tower or something, because it's never even once mentioned.  The entire story now revolves around a poorly explained "Tacitus" which I only know what it is because I watched some cutscenes from C&C; Tiberian Storm, and a cyborg army Kane had apparently been hiding underground China and Russia for 50 years or so.  There is a huge build-up to these cyborgs and how they will be Nod's vengeance and Nod's resurgence and how LEGION will be connected with them to form some kind of insane military force under your command.The next mission, it's discovered that these cyborgs are little more than infantry soldiers.  Soldiers only slightly more powerful than regular militants.  They replace the militants and the fanatics, but they're pretty much useless on their own, so as usual they're little more than a wasted novelty, and you'll be right back to your backbone of rocket troopers, stealth tanks, and avatars and the like.Gameplay is completely the same as in the original, and unlike expansion packs like "Yuri's Revenge", which completely revamped Soviet technology and added a whole new faction, this expansion pack isn't even at the level of "Starcraft: Brood War" in terms of gameplay change.The only differences thus far have been unit replacements with "beta" versions, or "super" versions (that somehow existed during C&C3; and were more powerful than their original bases, yet never ever deployed), such as a beta version of the Avatar, or a super Juggernaut which is immobile.Outside of the campaign, the only major difference I've noticed is the addition of infantry transport for Nod, and every faction getting a SUPER DUPER UUPER TRUUPER unit, in something of the same vein as the Titans in "Age of Mythology: The Titans".This leads to game balance: The game balance is terrible.  Simply terrible, perhaps worse.  Considering how little this expansion pack changes gameplay, gameplay balance issues also apply to the original game.GDI is the superpower faction in this game and expansion pack.  Period.  Nothing else can compete on their level.The Scrin, for all their doomsday presence and sudden shocking appearance and seeming invincibility, are in actuality the equivalent of the Zerg (from Starcraft) without Hydralisks or Ultralisks; they are a two legged dog with missing teeth.  They don't have any heavy units except the Tripods and the Aircraft capital ships, which despite their immense firepower, are ridiculously low on HP, meaning that unless you research shielding for them, they will be picked off against a hefty GDI base defense.The Brotherhood of Nod has plenty of novelty and expertly wielded stealth technology, though in the end their army is essentially broken, as their only efficient anti-air ground unit is the Stealth Tank, and while the Avatar (and the SUPER DUPER UUPER Titan unit the Redeemer) are big and scary and can soup themselves up by scavanging from friendly units, they are ultimately cannon fodder in comparison to their GDI equivalents.Despite the massive size and massive cost and massive armor hull for the Redeemer, it is a weak lump of crap compared to its GDI equivalent, the MARV, most especially due to the fact that its fire rate is the slowest of any Nod unit in the game, and only about 3 or 4 times more powerful than a normal Avatar's base laser.And so in the base game and the expansion pack, GDI is the super-duper-superpower powerhouse, with all the best weapons and best armor and best units for utterly dominating and crushing the opponents.
This is 2003, and I for one have completely had it with Westwood's ridiculously bad AI.  We took this kind of unit stupidity in 1992 with Dune 2 when the RTS genre was new, but when is Westwood finally going to wake up, smell the coffee, and realize that they can't just keep putting new graphics on the same game, give a minor gameplay tweak here and there, ignore the AI and corresponding strategy elements, and expect us to dutifully keep swallowing it and shelling out the bucks?What was the original C&amp;C's gameplay like?  Click click click click, build build build build, then click to attack (or defend) with your hundreds of units.  Repeat.  And repeat.  Until someone edges out a win because they clicked slightly faster, or the tiberium is done and a victory is squeaked in via attrition.  Now fast forward to 2003 and C&amp;C: Generals.  What's the gameplay like?  Click click click click, build build build build, then click to attack (or defend) with your hundreds of units.  Repeat.  And repeat.  Etc ad nauseum.This isn't strategy.  In fact the so-called &quot;Real-Time Strategy&quot; has never been about strategy at all...it's just a marketing term to give a very rote, very brain-numbing kind of gameplay more of a cerebral spin.  Well a lot of us tolerated that lack of strategy and AI, with the hope that as the genre matured, Westwood would have enough vision (if not common sense) to finally put in a worthy AI and make these games a truly fun, strategic challenge to play.  Well they never did, and with what we're seeing, it doesn't look like they ever will...all they do is spend all of their resources - ALL of them - on graphics.  The computer &quot;opponents&quot; and units are all as stupid as ever, and once you learn the units and the rote action, gameplay is also just as coma-inducing.  :PSave your money and your time.  You haven't just seen this before, it's practically all you've seen if you've followed Westwood games, and anyone expecting this game to finally start using the immense amount of potential computer intelligence available to us with modern PCs, will be very disappointed indeed.  &quot;C&amp;C: Generals&quot;?  More like Mindless Clickfest 2003.  Pass.

Sid Meier is a true artist in the realm of software, but with each new addition to the Civilization family the games become more oriented toward conflict and less fun to play. In AC the Believers will appear on your  borders within the first 50 turns and you will never really be at peace  again. Forget about the fun of managing a nation: this is a non-stop  Darwinian struggle to keep your head above water. (Some players might like  this, but I find it tedious.) There's no point in trying to negotiate with  other factions because they'll just turn right around and violate your  territory or declare war. Then after you have spent decades trying to build  up your industry, when your output reaches a certain level the planet  itself will being to attack you with an inexhaustible supply of mindworms.  *Every* game of AC is a race to achieve the victory conditions before the  planet itself defeats you, and there's not much sense of satisfaction in  that. Add to this the fact that the game runs unbearably slowly. You will  spend more time watching units go plod-plod-plod across the screen than you  will playing. I really wanted to like this game, but after a while its  defeatist atmosphere and tedious play just got too wearisome. Let's hope  that in his next game Side remembers that growing an empire is more fun and  challenging than beating one.

If your a fan of the LOTR series than this game is for you.  All you more hardcore RTS players might want to spend your fifty bucks elseware.  Fun factor I gave this game 3 stars.  Keep in mind my judgement is a little bias, I am a fan of LOTR.  The campaign is a blast whether you are evil or good.  Besides the campaign I dont really see what else this game has going for it.  Boring and uncreative formations tend to not serve purposes sometimes.  All units evil or good have a generic formation that either raises their attack or defense.  And no the formations do not even look good.  Half the time you cant even tell if they are in a formation or not.  The biggest problem for the more seasoned RTS players out there would be that advanced controls are non exsistant in this game.  Many times you may find your units chasing enemy units half way across the map bc there is no hold position command.  Or other times you might find your units getting torn apart by archers but all your units do is just sit there and do nothing.  The units seem to not auto attack buildings and sometimes even enemy troops.  I marched all my troops into an enemy base and the majority  just stood there getting rocked by the towers.  Its really annoying to have to manually guide each unit to attack when you have 20 other things going on at once.  An interesting feature in the game, you can combine archers with other units.  When I first did this I was like ok cool my infantry will shield my archers while they fire...to my suprise as soon as I combined the unit the archers no longer fired their bows but engaged in hand to hand combat whenever I ordered them to attack.  Little problems like that can be found throughout this game.  Whats the purpose of combining the archers with infantry if the archers just become a less effective weaker infantry.  When I got this game I was expecting units to have massive amounts of men in them like in RTW.  Again to my dismay many units comprise of only 6-8 men,  some even fewer.  Dont worry though you still can get some massive battles going, nothing like RTW though.  All in all a fun game for about a week definately not worth the fifty or forty bucks you are gonna pay for it.  My Number 1 problem with the game, No Advanced Controls!

Like I have said before when I reviewed Tiberium Sun, Westwood provided a excellent battle interface and look.  Now I just want Westwood to give a game with a good storyline.  In Tiberium Sun, it was horrible how they gave James Earl Jones and Michael Biehn such a...bad storyline to act to.Now in Firestorm, we have to relive all the nonsense again.  Why did I buy this add-on?  First of all I got it for dirt cheap and I wanted to see what the new units had to offer.  Firestorm is truly the worst add-on pack that Westwood has ever made.  At least the orginal CC add-on pack had the dinosaur levels.  Why anyone would want to play the same storyline twice is beyond me.  The AI is truly stupid.  On the GDI side, just amass a large group of Orca bombers and you can obliterate anything, and on NOD side, you can pretty much Sub APC engineers and steal all your enemy's buildings and easily defeat them.  I finished the add-on in one day.  The add-on is that pathetic.The Add-on is centered on one thing, DESTROY CABAL.  Now, I happen to think that CABAL is pretty kewl, especially when you are working with him.  But now you have to destroy him twice in both campaigns.  One of the new units, the Reaper, you do not get to build or create which is pretty much useless.  And in the last mission on NOD campaign, CABAL attacks you with both NOD and GDI units.  The computer always has to cheat doesn't it?  The game play is still unbalanced and you can whiz thru most missions like a breeze.I don't recommend this unless you are really bored and want to play thru 9 missions on both sides that follow the same storyline.  I truly hope Red Alert 2 will be a improvement.  I really don't think anything can top the storyline in the orginal Command and Conquer.

The game has been just released. But I am not going to buy it. I used to a have a standing pre-order but not anymore, that has been long canceled. I gave EA a chance to mend its ways but it failed. Here is why.This is a warning Review. Warning of the dangers of the harbored Digital Rights Management (DRM) subroutine that comes unavoidably bundled with the game. This type of DRM (SecuROM 7x with Limited Installations) is well known as it has already been used in at least two other games (BIOSHOCK & MASS EFFECT). So my review is based on first-hand experience of a core aspect of the game.Apparently EA would rather keep its customers in the dark. That is why, in the past month, EA Forums got censored, Wikipedia entries selectively edited and Amazon reviews repeatedly deleted. What is worse, Amazon (possibly without knowing it) is breaking the law which requires the full disclosure of bundled snoop-ware.LIMITED INSTALLS? Yes, LIMITED INSTALLS!!! We only get to ride this shiny pony for...3 laps! The official announcement mentions "on 3 different computers" but avoids to clarify what a "different computer" makes: will changing the graphics card trigger the loss of a token? what about attaching a new hard-drive (internal or external) or adding a new user account. All the above have been reported to subtract installation tokens from BIOSHOCK or MASS EFFECT - and EA has intentionally left this area dark gray.Moreover, in order to enforce the limited installations, exactly like BIOSHOCK, there will be IRREMOVABLE FOLDERS placed in our systems' Root that will effectively revoke our Administrator rights to our own PCs! Short of reformatting, there is no deleting them even if logged in as Administrators.Is EA trying to pave the way towards a nightmarish future where PC gaming will be a continuously-billed service (such as direct-Pay TV) and not a product?Is EA trying to trigger a lemmings stampede towards the Pay-per-Play cliff, where gamers will be regarded as herded cows to be milked over months and years?Is the Company trying to turn our PC systems (that we bought and paid for) into their proprietary consoles, hence monstrosities such as SecuROM that offer zero anti-piracy protection?According to statements by their own spokespersons (such as John Riccitiello, CEO of EA) the answer to all of the above question is YES. However, I want to make clear that none of these statements had any impact on my rating of this game. The game has enough troubles as it is...Is it fair to rate badly a game based on its short duration or bad graphics? How about its instability and bugs? How about harboring potentially dangerous subroutines that will render it useless within a 12-16 months? You see how this is going?In the end, after all is said, with SPORE it boils down to this: who will actually be owning my copy? Are we to pay $50 only to...RENT this from its publisher, be potentially pestered with the insulting need to prove our purchase forever and place our hardware and data in danger?And what makes this even harder to understand: will such extreme measures actually prevent piracy? Of course NOT! They did not work for similarly DRM-plagued BIOSHOCK or MASS EFFECT, why should they start working now?So, one has to ask: what is next in store for customers that make the mistake of buying such a product? Will they be required to pay again to buy another copy of the game when the first one expires?Is THIS the solution that EA executives came up against piracy: since they cannot stop piracy, let's make all our paying customers PAY TWICE to make up for their million dollar bonuses?!NO THANKS! No game is worth such harassment!

Crysis is simply amazing, and I expect Warhead to be excellent also. I've waited for this release, but sadly, I will not be buying it. The DRM in this game is a deal-breaker for the following reasons:1. Securom 7, the DRM scheme, installs itself on your computer and is as hard as a computer virus to uninstall. It requires making registry edits, and is far outside the realm of what most people are comfortable with Securom 7 causes possible security issues, system failures, and some legitimate software to stop working. It can prevent legitimate programs that burn cds to stop functioning correctly. It does not install when you uninstall the game. EA doesn't disclose these facts on the game's packaging, or in the game's EULA.A very similar program was deemed illegal by the Supreme Court. The FTC's previous ruling against Sony can by found here: [..]"Installations of secret software that create security risks are intrusive and unlawful," said FTC Chairman Deborah Platt Majoras. "Consumers' computers belong to them, and companies must adequately disclose unexpected limitations on the customary use of their products so consumers can make informed decisions regarding whether to purchase and install that content."2. The game has limited activations (5) meaning that you can only install the game a total of 5 times. I think I rebuilt my computer 4 times just in life span of the original Crysis (always chasing more frames, new graphics card, then two of them in crossfire, new processor {quad core} etc... With this new DRM I would have run out of installs in only 6 months or so! I will not pay $30.00 for a game rental, which is what 5 installs effectively makes this game. Even the version available for download through Steam comes packaged with the install limit and Securom, really calling into question the purpose of both: Steam by its very nature prevents piracy, so why would the Steam version need additional DRM OR an installation limit???3. DRM doesn't stop piracy, it only hurts honest consumers like myself (I own, and have paid for, literally hundreds of games). Spore is a perfect example of how DRM doesn't stop piracy. It is now the most pirated game in history, despite this same invasive DRM. Pirates don't care about DRM; they crack it and then happily play their DRM free version. It is those like myself who buy the game retail that get stuck with all the crumminess of DRM.4. DRM means you can never re-sell your copy. This potentially violates the doctrine of first sale, which has been upheld by the Supreme Court on more than one occasion. Basically, if you buy this game and don't like it or finish playing it and don't want it any more, you will never be able to sell it to someone else, because there is no way to demonstrate to them that there are installs left on your version. You can read about first sale law here:[..]In conclusion, the game itself is not the issue here. The issue is that a really excellent game comes packaged with an invasive, draconian DRM scheme that cannot be uninstalled, has ring 0 access to your computer, limits your installations to three, and can potentially crash software you have installed, or even your computer itself.This would not be acceptable in the case of a DVD or CD, so why would we as consumers accept it in a game? I honestly feel bad that Crytek got hooked up with EA and their malware DRM, as I love their games. I hope that by not buying this one (unless they change the DRM scheme) I and others will influence EA games, or at least Crytek, to steer clear of DRM that only hurts me and you, their honest, paying customers. If you want to learn more about DRM, here is a useful guide: [..]***UPDATE***YES I HAVE READ THE FAQ PUT OUT BY CYRTEK. Their FAQ fails to answer or even address many of the concerns with DRM:1. How is this DRM expected to prevent piracy since all DRM (even Securom 7x) gets cracked almost immediately? (Take a look at Spore which was cracked in HOURS, not days)2. Why do we, the paying customers then get stuck with DRM, while pirates, who pay nothing, get a superior copy without DRM?3. I have problems with any DRM that installs in the background, is virus hard to uninstall, and has ring 0 access to my system. I am the administrator of my computer NOT Securom 7x, and any program that takes that control away from me is unacceptable. It is also well known to cause conflicts with legitimate software, and even cause some user's computers to crash. The FTC shot down Sony's similar DRM a couple years ago; this seems like the same thing all over again. Securom 7 utterly fails in its stated purpose, to prevent illegal copies of the game. So why is it still being used considering all of it's negatives?4. Why is this DRM necessary on the Steam version? Steam, by its very nature, prevents illegal copies from being made.5. Is the number to get new activations toll free? Also, EA has deplorable customer service (check out the fiasco for those of us with Vista 64-bit who purchased Crysis online and were forced to play at 32-bit, all while EA insisted it was our computers that were the problem, when it was their garbage software installer) and I frankly don't trust them. What assurances are in place that if making a call, someone will be able and willing to help us in a reasonable amount of time?If they get back to me with answers, I will happily modify this review as necessary.
I can't get Mass Effect 1 to play on my PC.  I looked online for solutions to the issue only to find out that my operating system is not compatible (I run Windows 7 64 bit), but the box (as well as the ad on Amazon) only lists the minimum requirements Windows XP SP3, Vista SP1 or Windows 7.From what I have read online, customers running Windows 7 64 bit have had issues launching the game.  I tried several websites and blogs looking for a solution (none found) and I also attempted to contact Origin technical support.  When I typed the issue that I was having on their live chat... they never responded.  I waited for over twenty minutes after being connected and they never typed a word in response.  Very poor service.  Even if they had no solution, they should have at least stated the fact.I tried opening/running it with previous versions of windows, but it will not launch.  I tried contacting Tech support for the online launch and they would not even reply to my inquiry.  I ran all updates for my PC to ensure that everything was up to date.  I scanned my PC for damaged files... nothing worked.Online I read many stories from others whom had the same experience.  No matter what they tried the software failed to launch, and when they reached out for tech support they found no solution or no response at all.Very disappointed that I can only use 2/3 of what I paid for.  You purchase the trilogy for the story continuity.  Not having all three work not only disappoints because of what was paid, but also what was lost during the experience of playing the next two.My recommendation is that I loved Mass Effect 2 & 3.  But I don't like the Trilogy product due to the launch problems for ME1 being a known issue for a long time.  Apparently they never corrected the issue and have failed to list this issue on the software box or on the ad on Amazon.If you are running Windows 7 64 bit, consider that ME1 has problems launching before purchasing it.
This game was released about 2003 and developed over the 5 years prior to that. It also is completely unsupported by its "owners" EA (which bought it from Maxis)and has been for pushing a decade (it is a "cash cow" only). It is out of it's element on todays machines. The game is single-threaded and has its own scheduler. It is not well-adapted to a multitasking environment. It also can be rather snarky in getting along with some graphics cards. This means it has some real quirks and issues such as occasional failures to save, or lost cities, or "crash to desktop" (CTD's). On the other hand these can be countered by frequent saves and backups along with certain "habits" in the play methodology.If one does this, this game has some real appeal to many people.The game was released as a core game, Simcity 4 (SC4) and an expansion, Rush Hour (RH) which in combination was dubbed "Simcity 4 Deluxe" SC4D. The Rushhour expansion used to be available seperately, but is quite scarce and/ or very expensive nowSimCity 4: Rush Hour Expansion Pack.This particular release is only SC4 and frankly is essentially unusable by itself as much of the elements of the game, and much of the expanded customizable hooks, especially the "networks" part.. that part which handles the commuting and travel mechanics, allowing a wide array of "transportation" simulations. To be really useful you MUST (IMO) have the FULL set available in several forms (see below). My low rating is for THIS VERSION ONLY. I really quite like the game itself in its full, properly-registered form.There also is a very active community, especially in the USA, Germany and Japan and lessor followings in many other countries. This group is very community oriented and supportive. Maxis was clever to embed into the game "stubs" which support a wide array of end user customization content, and this community generates active interest which carries the game well beyond its years. This group congregates on a half dozen or so "support sites" (all free) which are accessable by all. I'd estimate there are probably about a half million fairly active players worldwide.The game is not played versus other players (other than in comparing accomplishments or progress or sharing custom content). It is a "strategy" game based on figuring out the operation and biases of the game and designing your city designs to best overcome and conform to these needs. There isn't "an answer" but rather a broad array of approaches that work to varying degrees based on what you are trying to achieve (dense ghettos, idylic contryside, sleepy towns, etc) A single "regional development" can easily take weeks to months of off and on attention to work through these issues. If these kinds of things appeal to you, this may be the game for you, just not in this version.The game uses a copy protection scheme that requires the CD to be in the machine to play (or in the downloadable Amazon or Steam versions a running "game support" program that validates the game) Some folk are rather put off by this.In summary, though this is still the core of the game, DON'T BUY THIS VERSION.. buy the full set.SimCity 4 Deluxe Editionor the downloadable versionSimCity 4 Deluxe Edition [Download] (also available via Steam) or as a subset of a box set with other games includedThe SimCity BoxI have heard there are support problems with the patches on the box set, but don't  have personal experience with it. The downloadable versions should be "pre-patched".Be VERY CAUTIOUS buying a used version from eBay, etc as you MUST have the registration membership in the EA/Maxis web site to update the game with it's patches.. only buy if you can get this membership with its User Name and Password included or certification that the serial number has never been registered... many people have been burned on this matter Even buying "new" versions is risky as many are just pirate copies of the game and the registration number will report "already in use" even though you "bought it" as "new". Get the seller to guarantee the version is register-ableSorry to be so long-winded, but I felt most of this needed to be touched upon. In whatever form you buy it, I recommend immediately taking a look at web sites which have active communities interested in the game. You can happily invest many hundreds of interesting hours in the game if you're willing to invest the time.

Buyer beware - the product description does not describe some importantaspects of the game:This game requires an Internet activation, so if you have no Internetconnection you can't play.Also you are limited to 5 activations - so effectively you are not buying and owning a game, you are merely renting the game.This game secretly installs copy-protection software called SecuROM which can cause many problems for your computer, some of which are:1. When installing the game the user is not informed that SecuROM is being installed.2. SecuROM denies administrators full access to their PC, and blocks theadministrator from editing certain parts of the registry.3. SecuROM can interfere with the operation of hardware, specifically disc drives.4. SecuROM can interfere with the proper operation of software.5. When the game is uninstalled SecuROM is not uninstalled - it remainspermanently on your computer.6. The manner in which SecuROM runs on your computer is similar to that of malicious software called malware, and many people do indeed consider SecuROM to be malware.There have (at May 2009) been five class action lawsuits have been filedagainst Electronic Arts (EA) for their use of SecuROM.
Rushhour is CRUCIAL to the satisfactory play of Simcity 4. The game was released as the game, then this Rushhour expansion , then the combination (called SC4 Deluxe). Since the Deluxe version is available in several forms (which include Rushhour) it is just crazy to pay this kind of money for the expansion alone. I don't normally rate things based on cost, but in this case a downgrade is warranted.

DRM with Activation limits has nothing at all to do with piracy. The game was already pirated days ago before it was released in the UK or America. They are using limited activations to prevent second hand sales and to limit the lifetime of the game. You will perpetually require an Activation Server to be running all the time if you want to install this game in a few years time. The DRM is also the beginnings of forcing games to become a RENTAL revenue model, as per the wishes of Electronic Arts own CEO, John Riccitiello, who wants us all to buy bare bones games in the future and pay for all the content as "extras".(see: [...]).SecuROM has already been prosecuted for using similar DRM technology in the music industry. The DRM that EA is using in Spore is unlawful.You can read the FTC ruling here: [...]

Some reviewers have suggested that the main problem with Dragon Age 2 is that it adapts the world of DA to the strictures of Mass Effect's gaming style, resulting in an unpleasant masseffectification that saps the playing experience of its uniqueness.  While there are a few small senses in which this is true (especially with the adoption of the dialogue wheel), to make this claim is to miss the mark: Dragon Age 2 is simply a downgrade from its predecessor in virtually every way.  If anything, we should be stunned that Bioware, a company which responded to nearly every criticism of Mass Effect 1 for its development of Mass Effect 2, appears to have completely ignored the feedback that they received for this series' previous title, Origins.Perhaps the most crippling issue--and also the most surprising--is the game's poor writing quality.  Dragon Age: Origins set the bar for clever dialogue in gaming, giving gamers an unforgettable experience.  From Morrigan's imperious jabs, to Zevran's lewd humor, to Alistair's goofy commentary, each character's remarks seethed with carefully crafted personality; even the Warden's speech options were routinely witty.  By contrast, the cast of Dragon Age 2 (with the exception of the suave dwarf brigand Varric) is uniformly uninteresting, wooden, and above all, angsty.  You'll groan as Anders and your brother Carver assail you with angry tirades about the mages and templars, sigh apathetically at the totally forgettable Aveline, and shake your controller at the screen in frustration as Hawke routinely makes comments that fail to reflect the options you select on the dialogue wheel.  Possibly worst of all, in a flagrant "screw-you" to Dragon Age's considerable female fan base, this game is utterly devoid of charming male characters to romance, and thus members of the Alistair fan club will find themselves scratching their heads in puzzlement.  One imagines that Bioware's real writing team went on vacation during the development of this game, leaving their collective pens in the hands of the Substandard Amateurs wing of the company.Yet all this does not touch on the second, and equally dismaying, element of failure in Dragon Age 2's writing: the plot itself.  If you were hoping to recapture the sense of epic, sweeping adventure that the lush fantasy world of Ferelden immersed you in during Dragon Age: Origins, then prepare yourself for disappointment.  Instead, as the Champion, you'll be trapped in the dreary hell-hole of Kirkwall, an unimportant city whose defining aesthetic feature is its statues of wretched, emaciated, shackled slaves.  There is nothing wrong about the choice of a "dark" aesthetic per se, which has been utilized to great effect by games like Dead Space, but what is wrong is that there is no corresponding feeling of risk or gravity.  No, you're not fighting against an oppressive force, evil demon, or diabolical tyrant--rather, as Hawke, you plod about aimlessly, wallowing in the general unpleasantness of Kirkwall, proceeding with documentary nonchalance as you complete an endless series of bitch-work tasks for needy and ungrateful citizens or teammates.  But for the occasional swarm of enemies, you might as well be playing Animal Crossing: Ugly Ghetto Edition.  There is no larger goal or driving motivation, no looming threat or call to action, and even the potentially-clever presentation of the narrative through Varric's interrogation is dull and anticlimactic.  ("So, tell me, what did the champion do next??"  "Well, then he traveled north, where blah blah blah...")  Moreover, the entire story is fueled by the conflict between mages and templars, which worked fine as a footnote in Dragon Age: Origins, but as the driving thematic force behind DA2 is nothing short of excruciating.(As a side note, I ask: What's with all the blood mages?  Becoming a blood mage was a huge deal in the first installment, like selling your soul to the devil--something really rare that evoked a strong reaction from people.  In this game, everyone and their dog is eagerly lining up to slit their wrists and summon sinister demons.  Seriously, large roving bands of blood mages will repeatedly attack Hawke's group for no reason whatsoever, and half of the quest arcs end with some character coming out of the blood-magical closet.)I'll admit that the graphics and combat of this game have undergone a significant makeover.  The lush visuals and fast-paced action of DA2 are extremely satisfying.  That said, most of the other technical aspects of the game have either remained in stasis or deteriorated in relation to Origins.  Your teammates' AI is routinely moronic, with healers forgetting to heal and characters bunching together as they're pelted by area-of-effect attacks.  The old cumbersome crafting system has been unwisely retained, if somewhat revamped.  The campsite has been eliminated, and to initiate group dialogue you're now required to visit characters at their own separate households, obnoxiously scattered throughout Kirkwall.  PC armor tends to be visually underwhelming, often leaving Hawke the least interestingly dressed member of his or her band.  Loading times are endless--a factor which I would normally overlook, except the individual landscapes are so tiny that you're hit with a loading screen every thirty seconds to three minutes.  These landscapes, furthermore, are reused, such that you traverse the same dungeons and environments over and over again for different quests.  Finally, the game even freezes from time to time; not ultra-frequently, but often enough to be annoying and mar the quality of the playing experience.All things considered, I have to admit that it's difficult for me to be objective about this game.  Dragon Age: Origins was an incredible experience marred by only a few flaws, and its sequel seems to have exacerbated those flaws while jettisoning some of its better qualities.  If I squint my eyes and imagine that DA2 was made by some obscure indie developer, I find myself thinking that it's good--not great, but merely rental-caliber good; perhaps a notch or two below the Fable games.  However, there is ultimately no escaping the impressive standards which Bioware has set for itself through previous titles, and as with a substandard Pixar movie or Zelda game, I can't help but judge this to be the inferior work of a creative team that knew better.Let's just cross our fingers and hope that the next Dragon Age installment will, like a Fereldan hero who slays evil when all hope appears lost, restore this series to its former glory.
Azurik reminds me a little of Turok: Dinosaur Hunter from years ago, except the premise is far less interesting and the main character is blue. Yep, blue. One of those ridiculous-looking Japanese Anime characters with tattoos and whacked-out hair. Worse, he appears to be made of a stiff plastic which makes him move with the realism of a Barbie doll. Seriously, he marches up steep hills without a single knee flex!The textures are nice, but the animation quality in Azurik is very poor by today's standards. Those of you who are saying this game really showcases the Xbox should try a few more games. The music is a poor attempt at a movie score, and the creatures you have to battle are as dumb as posts. The birds that fly around are animated so badly that I burst out laughing. But worst of all, the controls in Azurik are so lame that you have to spend half your time and energy just managing (centering) the camera so you can see what's going on.The bottom line? This is Microsoft's worst Xbox game, and if I were the product manager I would have pulled the plug. Stick with the likes of Halo, Munch's Odyssee, Project Gotham Racing, Cel Damage, and any EA Sports game for state-of-the-art fun.

This is the worst bond game ever, and possibly the worst game ever. It is not a game, it's a movie. here are the reasons it sucks:1)EA went with the trend and went 3rd person.

This is the worst bond game ever, and possibly the worst game ever. It is not a game, it's a movie. here are the reasons it sucks:1)EA went with the trend and went 3rd person. This disallows for any entertaining gameplay at all, because you cannot sidestep.2)The co-operative multiplayer is a completely different story than the single player, and all of the characters you start with are generic ppl.3)The Co-operative mode is unbelievably hard.

Everyone goes on and on about Mass effect 3, but despite that game being the most dumbed down for the masses ME title, it comes in second next to dragon ass 2s atrociousness.Simply put, this game is terrible. It is THE worst bioware game to date. At least Mass Effect 3 did a decent job of covering up how bad it actually was: DA2 doesn`t even try to hide it!There are no levels in this game: there are a series of hallways you spend 95% of the game running through.The crafting system is bare bones basic, and lacks anything even approaching innovation.The combat is exactly what the prick (not even going to say his name after being insulted by him on the bioware forums) said it would be: you know when you press A, something awesome is going to happen (XDXDXD)............ How did dragon age go from being the spiritual successor to Baldurs gate, to being a fantasy mass effect with none of MEs quality?Side quests are copy/pasted MMO fetch quests: they, like the entire game, are time wasters.The characters are essentially animated cardboard cut outs with fabricated personalities.Merrill is a mentally retarded elf.Fenris is a whiny elf.Anders is a whiny human.Aveline is a barbarian wannabe character that belongs in age of conan.Varric is a funny (BEARDLESS!!!) dwarf with something actually approaching a personality.Isabela is a useless slut who really doesn't need to exist, save for the fact that bioware has an increasingly nasty habit of replacing deep characterization with sex appeal.There are only two interesting characters in DA2: Varric, and the antagonist.The main quest is boring as hell. You spend its entirety running through the aforementioned hallways, fighting waves of mindless biodrones-i mean enemies that spawn right in front of you while occasionally running across a crafting resource that you don`t really care about.The theme of dragon age is suddenly mages VS templars. Like angryjoe (see his channel on youtube) said: the developers constantly beat you over the head with the ''US VS THEM'' mentality. Now i understand that the blight is over, and the series needs a new theme: but how about something more along the lines of ''Orlesian invasion of Fereldan'' or ''Elvish uprising''. Wouldn`t it have been better if they had saved so important an issue for a later date? The conflict bioware forced on the player could have gradually boiled over into the ****storm that they seem hell bent on forcing on us in the upcoming DA3.Romances in DA2 are like romances in ME3: the most shallow, poorly written crap you`ve probably ever seen in a game.If you were looking for at least a good, or just satisfying end to this game: don`t bother. Unlike in DA:O, you have no control over how the game ends. Everything culminates into a forced ''OMG DRAMA!!'' moment with a quick screen of leliana from the first game saying that the warden (your character from DA:O) has disappeared. But just before she does, Varrics voice gives a quick little summary of what choice the player made concerning the mage/templar conflict, and who he/she romanced.That`s it. There`s no ''Merrill returned to her tribe to seek their forgiveness, but was killed on sight'' there`s no ''Fenris dedicated his life to teaching his fellow elves how to defend themselves from their oppressive masters''. This games ending wasn`t the total bombshell that ME3s was, but like ME2, it was the warning that not enough of us heeded: a warning that our choices throughout the series will have little to no impact in the final game.Not only do i advise you to not buy THIS game: i also must advise you to stop buying dragon age products all together. Only disappointment and more: ''you`re just a butthurt fan who didn`t get the ending he wanted'' awaits.Bioware is dead.

WRPG or TPS:I bought this game believing that it was gonna be a wrpg, instead I was suprised to see that it had moved into the tps genre. That's not necessarily a good thing to do, switching genre's in the middle of the series. This game now enters into a different genre and suffering an identity crises being that its trying so hard to be both that it doesn't do either particularly well. I know that reviews are supposed to be based on the game itself and not what I was expecting, however, I'm reviewing this game based on the fact that it was marketed as an rpg with "some" tps elements in it not a tps with "some" rpg elements.*spoilers*Storyline: Main StoryThe main story starts out really good with the Normandy gettin blown up and Shepard dying. 2 years later Shepard is rebuilt by Cerberus and human colonies are dissapearing leaving no trace of what happened. Thats where the story dies and doesn't pick up until the end mission of the game. The game then focuses its story on getting more teammates and doing their personal background story missions. The main story takes a back seat to the supporting characters and there is no overall story advancement until you've done almost all of the personal story missions. In this game there is no feeling of a threat or danger from the collectors (the new enemy in the game) and noone outside of Cerberus seems to care about the human colonies going missing. The alliance doesn't even send an investigation team, they were so hellbent on Eden Prime when it was attacked in ME1 but now they're like eh, whatever. I was excited to get to go back to the Citadel only to find out that the council that is now in power because of the choices I made in the first game has no intention of meeting me and talking to me. Getting to be a spectre in the first one was a huge part of the story in the first game. I asked Anderson about getting spectre status back and he basically was like "here you go". Getting the spectre status back doesn't do anything, its unimportant and has no meaning and noone cares that I'm a spectre. The "twist" or oh wow part of the storyline isn't much of a twist being that it was used in a game early in the year 2009 called Gears of War 2-no, I'm not joking. Its way to similar to be a coincidence, its just plain sloppy and I can't believe noone else has seen or mentioned it with all the Gears of War references. Copying a storyline from another game is hardly Bioware's style and I was surprised that they did or used that in telling their story.Spaceports, level designs:The levels are pretty linear and small, they aren't massive and don't leave much or any room for exploration. I'm one of those people who like getting lost and trying to find my way around, so to me being told where to go and shown the way made it feel extremely linear. If I needed to leave the spaceport and had to go to a different system for a new mission, it was tabbed for what galaxy, system and planet to go to. The designs of the levels were actually done really well (Im no expert on describing level designs), they had animal interaction with the background environment and the levels had a great detail in the them but again they felt small and closed in not open and somewhat freeing. The develepors gave you a ton more galaxies to explore and very few were recognizable from the first game which really didn't quite make sense to me.  Even with all the new systems the game didn't have that feel of wanting to explore, going to a galaxy, selecting a planet to try and find an anomoly, it was tedius and what mission you did find felt like the same mission over and over again. Its also very easy to tell when you've explored a whole system because there is a percentage scale in the upper right hand corner telling you how much you've explored in that system and galaxy-gee, thanks for letting me know. One last thing to mention is every single planet is unknown until you explore it-are you kidding me?? The alliance and other alien races have civilizations on these planets, I'm flying around in the most advanced ship in the galaxy and they can't put the name of the planets in my galaxy map??? Its a small gripe but it goes to show just how little depth in these areas were taken into making this game.Loyalty quests:Your next of many quests and main focus of the game involve getting more teammates to join your crew, no convincing needed. After you've talked to them and learned more about them they will give you a loyalty quest. You get punished by not doing them, meaning you miss out on an extra power if you don't do the missions. Loyalty quests are a joke, they're very easy and they get repetitive real fast. By the time I got to my sixth, seventh loyalty mission I lost interest and care for the member and just wanted to get them over with. The best loyalty quest of them all, in my opinion,  is Grunt's, it's the most understandable one, it actually makes sense and the boss fight actually is a boss fight. Most of the character's missions are easy and if you're not paying attention you probably wouldn't even know you've entered into a boss fight until you were halfway done killing the boss. By the end of the game if you haven't done the loyalty quests you'll be wishing you had-they really make you regret it. You get Garrus and Tali back in the party from the first game, but why in the world do I need to make them loyal? They helped me save the galaxy in the last game so I'm pretty sure I've earned their loyalty already. I was also wondering how many squadmates do I friggin need!! I was fine with 6 in the first but now there's like 10-thats a lot of loyalty missions and a lot of talking and talking and talking. I like background stories as much as the next guy but seriously this is an overkill and a serious disctraction from the main story.Romancing squadmembers:Romancing squadmembers isn't all that great either, I had romanced Liara in the first game and when I met her in the this game, it showed the characters hug and kiss and then that was it. Well, they do talk but to me it didn't seem long and I felt gipped because I wasn't told much of anything (at least that's how it felt to me), no real detailed questions, no nothing-I was highly dissapointed in the interaction between the two characters. There is no girl/girl or guy/guy relationship, not that that bothers me that much, but if one I can do it in DragonAge and Jade Empire why not ME2.Customization: Weapons and ArmorThey took out the huge selection of different guns and armor. There are two different types of guns and 2 guns under each type for each character except for Shepard who gets to use 3 types of guns plus heavy weapons. To upgrade these weapons you need to tirelessly scan, scan and scan minerals from planets or buy the upgrades in shops-if you buy them they automatically upgrade and if you scan for minerals, you use the minerals to research upgrades for the weapons and again the upgrades are put in the guns for you. I liked being able to put the upgrades I wanted into my guns and armor as per ME1 instead of it being done for me. There are certain guns you find that are specific to certain characters but even they don't do the selection justice. So for example, Grunt gets a special Krogan shotgun and the explanation for why noone else can use it is because only the Krogan can handle that strong of a recoil. However, it also says the same thing for a specific Salarian weapon too-mistake me if I'm wrong but if a Salarian can weild it so can a Krogan. The overheating of guns is gone and replaced with ammo-I'm not even gonna touch that.I only found 4 different types of armor and wasn't able get each piece for each set. Armor was broken down into pieces, head, body, shoulders, legs and arms. Each part gives bonuses to sheilds and other stats but the difference is minimal at best, and the player can mix and match each armor to their liking. The Terminus armor seemed to be the best armor in the whole game, I actually noticed a difference in how much damage I could take. There is no way to check your stats so you can't compare or see what weaknesses you need to strengthen up. As for the Terminus and Dragonage armor you can't toggle the helmet on and off which made for a weird scene for when I met Tali for the first time in ME2. Tali recognized Shepard before Shepard said anything and she couldn't see Shepard's face because Shepard had the Terminus armor on-you can also apparently drink with your helmet on too. My biggest gripe in the whole armor thing is the only person who wears armor is Sheppard, no one else, the rest of your team wears their regular clothing into battle and if on a planet that requires you to wear a helmet they wear a mask. It really needs to be all or none. Once you do their loyalty quest you can change their costume (that makes an amazing total of 2 costumes for each teammate) and for Jack's, she actually gets to wear a shirt. I don't feel rewarded unlocking a different costume for my character that I have to make loyal and you can tell it wasn't a very important part to make in the game, it seemed liked it was rushed and that they really didn't care about the costumes or why Shepard has to wear armor but not the rest.Scanning minerals, buying fuel and probes:This is probably the worst part of the whole game. In the first game you clicked on a planet hit the "A" button and got your mineral for some planets. For others you had to drive the Mako in some crazy mountain that really sucked-if you want more info on the mako read other reviews, I'm not gonna beat it to death. In ME2 however, you actually scan the whole stupid planet and it takes for what feels like forever thats even with the upgrade-yes you can upgrade the scanner but it doesn't matter much when you're scanning planet after planet spending anywhere from just over 10 min's per planet (with upgrade) to around 15 minutes (w/o upgrade) per planet. I feel like I'm being punished, its time consuming, not fun and mind numbing. Also, when you do find minerals you shoot off probes to collect the minerals and you can get anywhere from 50-2,000 mineral deposits depending on how high the meter is on the scale. So you travel to different galaxies and systems to find minerals and you have to buy fuel and probes which gets expensive over time to get these minerals that you desperately need. Also, if you run out of fuel going to a different system you automatically get taken back to the system that has the fuel ship (I wanted to see if everyone would die out in space floating around with no fuel)-so basically there is no point to buying fuel except to waste your money.AI: enemy and alliesEnemy AI is pretty dumb, if out in the open they rarely took cover and even if I did get close they never tried to flank me. They pretty much knew exactly where I was on the map no matter if I was sneaking around or not. If they were near cover they would use it but still it really wasn't anything spectacular. One thing I did like about the enemies was that you could actually shoot their leg off or shoot the robots in half but I also think thats why the enemies all pretty much looked the same, there wasn't a whole lot of variety in enemy troops.Allies AI was really good (to me anyways as I played a sniper where I heard they are really annoying if you were up close in the middle of the fighting), they helped a lot in the fighting and took cover in pretty smart places, I played as a sniper so I never had a problem with them taking the spots I wanted or getting in my way while shooting. I never could tell if or when they were taking a lot of damage which really bugged me. The health meter from the first was replaced by pics of which teammates I had with me and the only time I knew what was going on is if the pic was in blk/wht, meaning they fell in battle, otherwise I had no idea what kind of damage they were taking. Something happened after I got my DLC though and my allies started abandoning me during gunfights, when the shooting started they ran off back to the beginning of the level and hitting the d-pad would bring them back to fire a couple shots and then they'd take off again. Lucky for me the fights didn't seem that difficult but it was still annoying getting in a fight and then all the sudden my allies had left me.Character Import:They did a horrible job with this and made a lot of people mad, especially me. Basically, if you played ME1 and beat it and your xbox got the red ring of death (like mine) and you ended up gettin a new one or having it replaced by Microsoft then you had to rebeat ME1 on the xbox you now currently have-luckily for me I kept my saves and only had to do the boss fight at the end of ME1 but others weren't so lucky. It took me over two hours after I had bought ME2 to play it because I had to figure out how to import my character. A lot of people either didn't have the first game anymore or didn't have a save anywhere close to the end of ME1. When ME2 starts up it takes the lvl of your character when you beat the game, so if you started a new game with your char and had it up to lvl 60 but didn't beat it on the second playthrough you didn't get that lvl character. Also you find out that it really doesn't matter anyways, depending on how high you get your character that level gives you a few bonus things but overall levels dont mean a thing in ME2. Also with a series of questions you can change the whole game of ME2 from your original if you wanted to. For example when I ended ME1 I picked "I don't care" for who should be Human council member between Udina and Anderson-"I don't care" isn't a choice in ME2 when getting asked the questions and I had to pick either Udina or Anderson to move on. So basically importing you're character has very little meaning on the storyline (some decisions like Rex can't be changed)when you can change it 30 minutes into the game. There is no point of going through this and why are they asking me these questions if I imported my character and choices in from the first game. I understand getting these questions if I had made a new character but not an imported one. Just another oversight in the developing of this game.Character levels and abilities:Leveling in this game is basically a joke-you don't see any stats, you don't see how leveling effects your character-what does leveling do?!!. I think you get to see how much health you have but thats it. The only point to leveling is getting points towards your abilities and abilities are far and few between. Your teammates have 5 abilities, chosen already for you,  and you get to put points towards them to make the abilities stronger and 2 of the abilities have to be unlocked by putting points in the other 2 abilities-it just doesn't make sense to me. The last one is unlocked by doing the loyalty missions for your teammates. As far as Shepard goes I think you get 7 but again you start out with 6 abilities,already chosen for you, and you just put points to the abilities you want and for the seventh one you actually get to choose but when you start the game over that ability is gone and you rechoose and get your points back. There is no strategy to this, you just put points in whichever skill, it really doesn't matter unless your lvl 10 or lower. The skills are on a 1-2-3-4 block scale, so you need one point for the first block in that skill, 2 points for the second block and so on. I read that people didn't make it to lvl 30 their first time through the game, don't worry its not possible-I did every single quest, side quest, sub-side quest and mission in the game. I made it to lvl 28. I know this because I listened in on every alien conversation I could, you get some side-quests for doing that, and went to every single planet (even searched the asteroid fields too, found some planets) in the galaxy trying to find missions. So don't worry if you didn't make it to lvl 30 your first time through, you didn't miss much and can't.Gameplay:If you've played Gears of War then you've already played ME2 in terms of being in firefights. Running around is just like in ME1 with a sprint button. Speaking of firefights, its really easy to tell when you're about to get into one. If you see a lot of boxes and places to duck and cover guess what???Difficulty:Normal and Hard are easy and insanity is either you have less health or their bullets do more damage, not sure which but insanity is only insane because of that.Downloadable Content (DLC): *spoilers*The dlc was ready from day one so why not just have it on the disc in the first place especially the "Normandy Crash" quest being that that is kind of a huge part of the storyline! I was excited to get to go back to the crash and when I walked into certain parts of the plane it showed what I thought was gonna be a flashback, instead it was pictures of the crew, no not only dead crew but crewmembers that were still alive. I walked into the cockpit area of the plane and it goes to showing a picture of Joker and not some really awesome flashback of watching Pressley getting blown up or Sheppard not making it to the escape pod. I was extremely dissapointed and very pissed off.Conclusion:Mass Effect 2 is mostly a TPS with very little RPG elements in it. If you like tps's you'll probably like this game, however, if like me and you were expecting a wrpg you'll be highly dissapointed. With the little to no control over customization and no (or should I say extremely limited) inventory it takes away from connecting or caring about your character and teammates. Since I felt that loyalty missions were an absolute must I had a hard time not getting annoyed with them and I was actually detatched from some of the characters I got late in the game. Leveling up usually means something in RPG's but in this game they are just numbers and thats it, I really couldn't tell the difference between level 1 and 20. Scanning planets, lack of difficulty, no suprise storyline typical of Bioware, unoriginal story advancement, loyalty missions feeling more like a must than an option and the lack of different abilities to choose from leave ME2 something to be missed. Loyalty and side missions are a joke-for example, getting ingredients for the cook is a joke and is unacceptable from Bioware as a quest. Mass Effect 2 is missing that Bioware touch that usually makes their games so special. I was expecting Bioware to deliver me that "WOW!!, that just blew my freaking mindhole!!" reaction for its twist moment and instead I got deja'vu remembering back to Gears of War's storyline. Mass Effect 2 is missing the quality and depth that Bioware usually puts into its games and thats why this game gets a very dissapointing 2 out of 5.
In November 2005, I ended my review of Madden NFL 2006 for the Xbox 360 by saying, "Hopefully next season EA Sports can throw in some of the gameplay modes that made Madden so different while improving on a few of the annoyances." Now, nine months later, I'm sitting in my gamer chair rocking back and forth with those new gameplay modes I wanted, but all of the same annoyances and a few more that ultimately make the sophomore next-gen Madden experience a very sour one indeed.Madden NFL 2007 for the Xbox 360 returns with beautiful graphics and attention to detail that made last year's game look and sound nice. The graphics have even been improved, the menus look sharper, there are flashy introductions to each game, and the animations look better than ever. There are some truly brutal tackles in this game. The field deformation looks fantastic and shows the realistic wear and tear on grass fields. The radio announcer is back again this year, as well as the increased amount of on-field chatter and far more realistic reactions from the crowd and stadium announcer. And once again, John Madden got a sock in his mouth As a guy who simply can't stand hearing meaningless, obvious banter, I'm very happy to not hear this man's chatter for another season. The soundtrack is pretty alright, with some of my personal favorite bands (AFI, Audioslave, Rise Against) being on the lineup. All of these things are the best things about Madden NFL 2007, which is why I wanted to get them out of the way. Now, let me proceed to tell you why you shouldn't be buying this game on the Xbox 360.Last year, current-gen Madden players were treated to a new mode called Superstar Mode. Superstar Mode was very similar to NCAA Football 2006's Race for the Heisman Mode-players would create a character and take him all the way through an NFL career in hopes of making him a superstar and a future Hall of Famer. This mode was great in Madden NFL 2006, because you had all the same control over your team, albeit with an obligation to get the ball to your player (or, on defense, sack the crap out of opposing quarterbacks). This year, Superstar mode has shown its face on the Xbox 360-and I'm not pleased. I'm not please at all. In fact, I'm disgusted. Superstar mode, in my opinion, is the worst thing ever to happen to Madden-or perhaps it's the execution. In this new mode, gamers are stripped of most control over the game. You're thrown right into the shoes of your own created player, seeing the field from only his perspective, and doing only what he's supposed to. If your character is a QB and you don't like the playcall, too bad Make the best pass you can, and good luck getting into the Hall of Fame with all of those sacks and interceptions The new camera angles make it almost impossible to see so much of what is going on on-field. It's really sad, because Superstar mode, if executed more like NCAA Football 2006's Race for the Heisman, could have been the best thing to happen to Madden-not the worst.Franchise mode last year was pretty bare, and it's sadly just as bare this year. I recently found a lot of enjoyment in creating a multiplayer Fantasy Franchise with a few friends in current-gen Madden NFL 2007, and I was very sad to see that once again, this option isn't available in the Xbox 360 version. Franchise is, simply put, a string of seasons with basic administrative options and the Super Bowl and Pro Bowl waiting at the end of each season. The only perk this year is the ability to go into training sessions with three of your players throughout each week of the season. Doing this will let you play some of the skill-based mini-games, as well as raise the statistics of your players if you succeed in meeting the scores in each of the mini-games.As a bonus for when (and I said when, not if) you get bored with Madden NFL 2007, EA Sports included some highlight reels of dozens of NFL Hall of Famers. It's nice to see old players being awesome, and I'd really like to see more highlights like this in future iterations of the game. Sure, these guys are Hall of Famers, but I'd really like to see highlights of current players as well. For instance, seeing clips of cover boy Shaun Alexander's 5 first-half touchdowns a few years ago, that would have been really cool. It would be interesting to see, in future games of Madden, if highlights like this could be added into the actual game alongside commentary to show off the history and background of star players. They do this in real life, and if it's in the game, it's in the game, right?After playing current-gen Madden NFL 2007, it's really hard to enjoy the next-gen version. I start noticing things that are so obviously necessary to the game. For example, there is no Playmaker control in next-gen Madden NFL 2007. There aren't as many hot route options. The play-calling menu, something I didn't mind last year, is abysmal for multiplayer games. Even the new and highly-touted Run to Daylight blocking feature was stripped down for the Xbox 360 version of the game. Most importantly of all, though, Madden NFL 2007 on Xbox 360 just doesn't feel like Madden. It's as stiff as a 40-year-old kicker. It's as chuggy as Peyton Manning's scramble. It doesn't feel quick, smooth, or fluid like Madden is supposed to feel. If Madden is supposed to feel this broken, they should put Limpin' Leftwich on the cover, hobbling to the sidelines.Another thing: if A.I. in football games doesn't improve, I give up. Unless you're constantly playing All-Pro or All-Madden difficulties, you'll encounter some absolutely ridiculous A.I. Maybe it's just my bad luck, but the favor always went to the opposing team. For example, my defensive backs absolutely never knew where the ball was. More than 75% of my swatted passes were done manually. Interceptions are never caught, but batted away. Blocks are oftentimes completely missed by guards and fullbacks. Players get stuck together running routes. They'll run their routes as the football is thrown just over their heads, without ever trying to reach up and grab the ball. Some of the animations for play action passes and bootlegs are so lengthy that a blitz will cut straight through the line and result in an easy sack for the defense. Tackles in next-gen Madden NFL 2007 are so frequently shed that it's almost useless to do anything but abuse the Hit Stick. Alternatively, tackles are too easily shed with the Highlight Stick-a welcome addition to the game, but something that's so easy to use, it's hard not to feel guilty abusing it.The problems don't end there. I encountered so many unexplainable flaws in this game that it's hard for me to believe it was finished completely. Is it a bug, or just a new rule that I haven't heard about, for the game to automatically cut off your control when you're winning in the end of the fourth quarter? Sure, it's unsportsmanlike to run up the score, but I'll be damned if I'll sit and watch the play clock tick down all 35 seconds to be a good sport in a video game. I think it's just a bug, because it happened pretty randomly in my play time. The graphics and frame rate stutter very often, causing frequent but short pauses that break up the fluidity of the game. And the bug to stomp out all bugs-the frequent crashes from Madden NFL 2006-return in 2007. My game crashed five times before I ever actually finished an entire game in Franchise mode. It's hard to enjoy a game when it crashes that often. Something really needs to be done here.I love Madden. I look forward to its release every single year. I had never been so excited to play a Madden game before, and Madden NFL 2007 for the Xbox 360 turned out to be the biggest pigskin disappointment I've ever endured. What could have been the first true fully-featured football classic on the Xbox 360 ends up being nothing more than a game that should get passed up by gamers for its current-gen superiors. The sad thing is, I don't know where EA Tiburon can go with this game. They started from scratch with Madden NFL 2006 on Xbox 360, so my only suggestion now is to do what 2K Sports did with their NBA and NHL franchises: use the same engine as the current-gen games and simply beef up the visuals and presentation. I'd rather have a prettier version of current-gen Madden NFL 2007 than what came out this year for Xbox 360. Madden NFL 2007 looks and sounds wonderful, but if you actually want a fun football experience, look no further than the game of the same name on PlayStation 2 or Xbox. You'll have a much better time for $10 cheaper.
I absolutely loved NBA Street 2 on the PS2. 1 and 3 where OK, but 2 was the best. It's almost like EA Sports took the concept of NBA JAM, with all the crazy dunks, no fouls, containing not just the rosters of current NBA teams, but legends as well. The game was almost perfect. Now EA have taken the Street games to the next level of graphics for the PS3. Apparently this is the first game to utilize HD graphics on the PS3. Sure, the graphics are good, there is no complaint there. Nor is it the controls.. the controls are perfect. They have not been modified, other than you only need L1 and R1 to do different kinds of dunks (which I miss the 4 shoulder button combinations) but other than that, the controls work perfectly. The game only glitched on me maybe two or three times, and it was only a small graphic on the shorts that went away in a couple of seconds, and the game only froze on me one time during a loading screen. So I can't say the programming is shoddy.Every current NBA Team in 2007 is here. For me, the rosters aren't much. I suppose if you like Kobe, Shaq, Lebron James, Nash and Carmello Anthony, then you will love playing as them perhaps... but I'm someone who loves the classic old school players from the past, whom where in the first 3 Street games... yet, there is not one legend in this game at all. That was the first disappointment I came across. I thought perhaps there was a ray of hope when I heard you could download legends as DLC... but they are not legends. They are the fictional characters from the first 3 games. So why are they DLC only? Why should we have to pay for fictional characters that where free in the first 3 games? Why are there no legends of the NBA to play as? That would have at least given this game a lot more interest in continuing to play once the one player challenges are completed.The game play is the same as the first Street games. 3 on 3 basketball, usually a game to 21 points, but you can also find yourself in games where you just need to lead by 3 points, first to 5, 7, 11, 15 points. It can also be customized. You can also play dunks only, shots only, and gamebreakers only rules. All pretty much the same as the first 3 games. Which is disappointing really, couldn't EA come up with some new modes of play?What the most disappointing thing about this game is the create a baller has taken a major step backwards. You cannot customize your created player. You can only choose from existing models of players from the game. I'm not even sure that you can even choose from all of them? What on earth where EA thinking? Creating characters has been huge in games for years now, and many games have some awesome creat-a-player options. But this one, you cannot choose anything. You just pick an NBA player that's from the game, and use them as your characters model. You cannot change hair, colors, height, weight, gender (male only) or even something whacky like sticking them in a monkey suit? Why the heck would EA do this? What's even worse, is you can only choose if you are a guard, forward or center, then choose what your main 3 skill levels to level up on will be. But you cannot choose your style, what kind of dunks you will do, nor can you pick any NBA jerseys to where in the game... not even a number. Can you beleive it? You play the whole game without a number on any of your Michael Jordan street jersey's you earn. Not the Bulls jersey, just plain jerseys with the MJ logo on it. Speaking of Jordan, he is my favorite of all time, but EA has really gone over kill with Jordan shoes and attire in this game. The only time you can pick a new jersey to wear, is when you earn one... and apart from the 2 you begin with, they are all Jordan brand shirts. Not only that, all the shoes are Jordan too. Yet, guess what... take a wild guess who is not a playable character in this game? Need I say more!The game modes are as follows.Pick Up Game = Exhibition.Home Court Challenge = The main game. Compete as your created baller, or should I say, model of a current NBA player, and keep on playing a few pick up games, or other modes as mentioned before, to earn enough XP to go into a tournament. The tournaments are always the same. All these do is allow you to unlock and compete on the next court. You play through the season, building up your xp levels, and in the end all you get is a pathetic animation saying you have become a legend of the game...and then.... nothing. You've unlocked all courts, (big deal as there is a cheat to unlock all courts anyway) and your created baller's stats have gone up. whoopdie doo. It only takes a day or two to complete home court challenge, depending on how much time you have on your hands.Whatever other modes of game play = Who caresPractice = speaks for itselfThe courts themselves are apparently based on actual courts of a few of the NBA stars courts they grew up playing on. Introduced by a boring clip of whom they are the court of, which gets skipped every-time it begins. Personally, I would like to have seen more courts. Proper NBA ones, ones from the original 3 games, and a few custom ideas. The courts in this, well, a couple are ok, but some are hideous. It doesn't help that the vision during game play has a stupid sepia tone over it. Apparently EA did this to make it look like you're watching old school footage of old school games. I'm sure Carmelo Anthony has a few 100 8mm tapes of his old games in his collection at home somewhere. The even bigger joke is there is no old school players to play with.The music is not much. It's there, but for the most part you don't take notice of it. However it's all jazz and hip hop sounding. Obviously EA couldn't care less about the soundtrack, so why would they care about putting in music that appeals to everyone... instead, just use generic stuff no one will take notice of. However, that may just be my own opinion. If you take a look at the Wikipedia page for this game, it has a brief snippet of the game details and the rest is just the soundtrack listing for this game. That speaks loudly enough on it's own without me having to say anything else about that.Another thing that has been left out from one of the previous Streets is creating your own courts. You can't even create your own team anymore. It's a real shame because this game has got the potential to make it a classic, but as far as I'm concerned, all it's focus was on details rather than anything that will keep you interested in playing once you have completed things.The unlockables are a joke. As I said, they are just courts, MJ training jerseys, and MJ shoes. Most of it you unlock just winning during HC Challenge. The rest are easily unlocked by just playing a certain amount of games in various modes. The only other unlokables are a couple of all-star teams. Containing 3 or 4 current to the day NBA stars who I couldn't give two &^%$# about playing as. Funny tho, the WNBA is unlocked right from the start. Yeah, you read that right. There is 4 or 5 females to choose from the WNBA to play as on their team. Buggered if I know who they are, but you can choose them off the bat in exhibition games. Still, can't create a woman tho.Pros.- Good graphics- Great controls- Fun for a little while- Two points for a double dunk- Game breaker 3 point dunks are a cool addition- Minimum Data requirement is under 400kb. No installation needed.Cons.- No NBA legends.- Create a baller is a joke.- No create a nothing options.- Lack of customization to anything but the bball game itself.- Home court challenge is too easy.- Not enough modes to play.- DLC contains fictional characters that should have already been in the game without the need to download them.- Lack of courts- Not enough dunks to do with your player (3 dunks without holding a shoulder button/3 holding one or both, and they change when you have a game breaker/plus you can do another 1 and only 1 when using l1 and r1 jumping off a teamates back during a game breaker... oh, and 3 when you don't have a gamebreaker activated and jump off them) that's a total of about 30 dunks a player can do. But which sounds like quite a lot, but by the time you have completed home court challenge, you are bored of the same old dunks, and want to either be able to change them, or wish EA had included the R2 and L2 buttons to do more dunks too. LIKE THEY DID IN THE PREVIOUS 3 GAMES.- No more rim wrecking, glass shattering, backboard smashing, pull the whole thing down dunks.- No hook shots.- holding L1 or R2 and shooting doesnt change the type of jump shot anymore.- Alley oops need a lot more variations.- The sepia filter needs an option to turn it off. Am I playing basketball or watching Superman Returns?- Commentary- Players soundtrack (what they say on the court) needed more, it's annoying hearing the same old thing all the time.- Intros are stupid.- The whole "get out of the hood" theme is irritating.- Kobe Bryant is in it (hehehe)- No super blocks- Blocking is way too easy- The trick moves lack in what you can do- Needs an option to trade NBA players to other NBA teams- No jump ball to start, player 1 automatically starts with an inbound pass.- Could have used some effects on monster dunks like fire, lightning or something not too over the top, but something like they had in the previous games.- The loading profile screen is a little bugged. Sometimes you have to load your saved data 2 or 3 times before the game asks you if you want auto save on or off. Shouldn't it just save that data and go straight into the select a profile?- Creating profiles needs to be done before starting the game up. (it should be if you choose to be player two, and it says load profile or choose your own, you would think CREATE might be amongst them!?)Overall. If you never played NBA Street 1, 2 or 3 on the PS2. And you don't mind the fact you can't play as any legends. Then you might think this game is pretty cool. Having been someone who played the heck out of the first 3, this game here to me is just a version that has stepped up in the graphics, but taken a giant step backwards in everything else. I won't say buy or do not buy, I just hope seeing it the way I see it will help you decide on if you think it will appeal to you or not, and not just give you a quick review of "I like it/I hate it" or the ever annoying, "I bought this for my kids and they love it". I just hope my review gives you a more in-depth perspective on what to expect and what not to expect. Keep in mind tho, I have never played this game online. However I can't imagine it being all that great from what I have been able to do so far. And beleive me, I found it easy, and not challenging, so I have no beef with the AI or anything. And I do beleive I mastered the controls to what I want, when I wanted. So don't get me wrong and think I was no good at the game or anything... my biggest issue is as I said, the lack of replay value and lack of options that where in in the first 3 games already. To me, this game is one giant step backwards in what should have been a mind blowing game. (even if it doesn't have NBA Legends to play as)
I've had this game for a week or so now and so far it's been decently fun, but few racing games are able to steer away from leading players into an utter hopeless feeling of frustration sometimes. Some days I put 8-10 hours of game play into it because in all truth, I'm competitive and I like racing games. Fun aside, the game is somewhat frustrating. First I would like to admit a few of my own personal flaws.1. I like racing games, but I'm not too keen to adjustment details (not seen in this game, this game is very simple). Adjustment details that can be found in much more advance, higher caliber, detail concentrated games like Forza.2. Because of number 1, I concentrate more on more simpler games. Thankfully there's NFS. My favorite NFS thus far is Most Wanted and the original older Hot Pursuit (PC). I like them because even though they're frustrating sometimes, the game is more easy going and you win more often. I know that's not the greatest reason, but I feel like the mixture of the two is more balanced in a positive way with those games.3. I'm also not a fantastic or very constantly good player. One game I'm GOD, the next I can't go 100 ft without hitting something.4. I have a bad temper, especially with frustrating games. My frustration is reasonable sometimes, even though I blame my lack of skills a bit more, but sometimes it just can't be helped.So I'll go to the point of way I think this game is lacking and frustrating:(Note that I play in career mode aka underground.1. I play this game and of course the graphics is not that great, it is a fairly old (2003~). Gaming has advanced significantly during that time. Anyhow, my point here is that the details are not adequate enough sometimes to let you see what's coming at you. When you race, you not only have to watch out for your rivals, but also what's in front of you and sometimes cars that not only go in your direction, but in the opposite direction as well. I can't really say that anyone is good enough to react fast enough to all occasions. Two examples would be going down hill where you momentarily go in slow motion through a third person often-side point of view and turning corners, whether sharp or not. I would race and the next thing I notice is a small bit of light and in a millisecond, crash. So during that moment, the details that I see, my head is trying to confirm whether it is a car or something else, maybe part of the scenary? The details are just not clear enough to tell you that to help you react fast enough, it's just very hard. The details in games that have you traveling at this speed with obstacles that are traveling at their speed towards you, should be spot on, clear, and crisp. This goes the same with a very similar other game called BURNOUT.2. Car position and spawning. We're talking about random cars used as obstacles. Sometimes they would stop while crossing the street for no reason, right in front of you. Sometimes, they would spawn near or in front of you. Sometimes they just appear down a steep hill which makes it almost impossible to maneuverer around because you don't even see them until you're practically over them.3. If you play this game, you'll probably notice that when you're near your rival racers, they tend to get into accidents a lot more. Sometimes, they would run into obvious objects to the point where it's just too obvious to be left unnoticed, where you start to understand that they're getting into accidents...not on accident, but on purpose. Like their main objective was to pretend to give you the feeling of a real race, where everyone can have accidents. However, off and away from your view, you'll start to notice that they almost always catch up and rarely get into accidents. If they get into accidents nearly as much as they do when you see them, how do they ever catch up? An obvious accident is running straight into another car even though the other car is still relatively far away.4. I don't understand the upgrade part of the game. They give you upgrades only for you to keep up with the other cars? It's like you never get an increased advantage over the other cars due to your newly/recently acquired upgrades. The other cars will always be as good if not better. The only reason you ever catch up is because of your reckless speed. I know the game is made to do this to give you a challenge, but it also demeans the thought of upgrading. Also take note that the other cars will match your upgrade, so if you don't upgrade, they don't either.5. New cars. I choose my car based on stats and until the 78/79th race where the Skyline is available/unlocked, all other cars have lower stats so what's the use in giving me new cars when my old car that I originally had the choice of choosing (Mazda), remains the best car in comparison? I keep unlocking new cars to drive, yet I don't see why I should even use them?6. Money. I play mostly on hard mode and, until recently started going into medium because it started becoming a game of frustration than recreation. Anyhow, money in this game feels worthless. I have something like 40k++ and I don't see myself ever using it all. I'm almost completely upgraded accept the last three...since when you buy an upgrade(s) for one car, all the other cars that are available will also have those upgrades available to them, I don't understand where the money is going into? I bought all the level paints, almost all the upgrades, full 5 star, and I have tons of money left. Hard mode gives you more money, but I don't see the use of it. I read in some guides that playing it almost completely in medium mode should give you enough money for everything. That's nice, but I don't really want EVERYTHING. I'm a completionist in training, but only when it counts. I'm not a hoarder of stuff that I don't even want. So if I'm not buying a ton of worthless stuff that I don't care for or don't even like, what's the money for? I could very well play the whole game in the lowest difficulty and still probably have enough money.7. There's really only a small handful of cars to use and in underground mode, there's a very, very small variety of maps to use. Mostly, they just make you go in reverse or open up an extra road here or there. You'll be racing in the same area over and over, that's a good and/or bad thing, depends on how you look at it.8. Why is this game even called Underground anyway? I don't see anything "underground" from it that is different from the others in the NFS franchise.OVERALL:This game is a little too much based on luck, especially with so little detail that you literally have to squint to make out the details of what's in front of you. Cars jumping out of nowhere, not getting into random accidents during a lap of racing...one lap is something, trying to cheat your luck on all 6 lap for example...that's just a little too much. The longest I've played a single race is an hour. I wanted to punch my monitor, but it's an LCD monitor and I don't have the money or time to replace it so...This game is so much based on luck, be prepared to click the restart button a few dozen times, especially on hard mode and even on medium mode.Is the game fun though? Yeah. My advice is:1. Keep racing till the end, sometimes for some weird reason, you might seem like you're losing for most of the race, but you might be able to win. Luck and reckless speeding is your bonus over the AI. However, if you're like 10-15:00 behind and you know you crash a lot, it's better to restart.2. Just turn the difficulty down if it becomes frustrating. It's a game, it's suppose to be fun and being frustrated, I'd rather just go to work or something...However, I do notice that sometimes the change in difficulty doesn't always make the race significantly easier for you....

Emotions and excitement are sky high right now with the release of SWTOR. Many people are just starting their journey and are blown away by the voice acting, cut scenes and story telling. Rightfully so! But with that comes a lot of early reviews from people high on their first experience with that aspect of the game, who haven't had enough time to settle a bit into the ENTIRE game or look objectively at the WHOLE package. Not to say that anyone who likes this game falls into that category, but there are a lot of people who do. I'll do my best to give an objective review here, from someone who has played beta to 50 and has spent enough time with it in both beta and release to really see what the full game has to offer.First things first - SWTOR is the ultimate example of what a theme park mmorpg is, and what I would call the 2000's model mmo. It takes everything that is typical of this model and gives it to you in the Star Wars universe, staying with every tried and true path to come before it. Some things it does infinitely times better (story telling, voice acting, cut scenes), other things are about equal to other AAA mmo's released over the last 3-5 years, and quite a few things are down right poor compared to those same mmo's. The more I've played SWTOR the more it does indeed seem that a huge majority of the money and development attention went towards the story, which resulted in feature after feature that seems to have received just enough attention to make it "passable" or "just good enough" as opposed to awesome or even just impressive. So let's break things down, from best to worst.- Story, voice acting, cut scenes - 9.5/10This is the selling point for TOR and by FAR the game's strongest feature. It's exactly what you would expect from Bioware and it definitely does not disappoint. All 8 classes have their own unique story which increases replayability a ton. Some may argue that the only difference is the class quests, which are a small portion of the game, so playing a new character isn't that much different - but isn't that still more than other mmo's have to offer? The effect of this feature is that it also increases the enjoyment of questing and dungeons (flashpoints) far above what I've experienced in the competition. Note that there are a lot of instanced quests in this game, but I didn't mind that. Similar to LOTRO, instancing quests affords the ability to make more complex story telling experiences possible in those instances. I would give this feature a 10/10, but one disappointment is that none of your decisions during conversations have real long term consequences or effects. You may alter the course of a quest, or experience different things in flashpoints, but at the end of the day your choices don't have that much impact. Still, that's a minor gripe, just having the small changes is better than nothing - which is better than all other mmo's offering in that regard, no choice at all.- Combat - 8/10The combat in TOR is good, it's nothing revolutionary but it isn't bad. Personally I think the animations are fine, although I've heard some complaints. The combat feels responsive and is smooth, and you do feel slightly more "heroic" as Bioware talked about by being able to demolish groups of mobs pretty quickly. I don't have a lot to add on this, it's basically the typical combat style of this mmo type.- Crafting - 7.5/10Crafting in TOR has a few nice twists. It is the typical theme park crafting model, but the ability to use companions, missions, mods and crits all help to make it a bit more unique. It's definitely no Vanguard, EQ2, or SWG crafting system, but it's a step above the system you would see in WOW, RIFT, AION, etc.- Flashpoints - 7.5/10Flashpoints, which are TOR's dungeons CAN BE a ton of fun. Focus on can be. The problem is that it seems they put a lot of time and effort into some dungeons (which are the awesome dungeons), and others are just filler. The great dungeons have a good amount of story, hidden things to trigger, crafting ability use to alter events in the dungeons, but the filler dungeons are pretty much just dungeons minus everything I just mentioned - what you would see in any other mmo. It's a shame that Bioware seemed to go the quantity over quality route in this regard to a degree. If there weren't the "filler" flashpoints I would give this category a 9/10, but there are, so 7.5/10.- Questing - 6/10Questing in TOR is a mixed bag. On one hand it's more fun than most other mmo's simply because of the story. The problem, however, is that most of the quests are still just kill, gather, or fetch quests. This is taken to the extreme actually, because other quest types familiar to the genre seem to be either absent completely in TOR or just in short supply such as escort quests, quests dropped from mobs, quests to defend certain areas or NPCs, etc. The voice acting is a nice addition, but it doesn't change the actual gameplay of the questing - which gets monotonous very fast, especially without a little more quest variety.- Graphics - 4/10The graphics in TOR are also an interesting mixed bag. Character models in cut scenes look spectacular, but after that, it is pretty poor. Textures in the world look about 5 years dated and so do character models (character models look different *better* in cut scenes). This is one area TOR is definitely behind the pack, as most mmo's over the last 3-5 years have had better graphics than TOR, at least in my opinion. Clearly they wanted to make the game easy on machines, for broader audiences, but it would have been nice if they designed it to look better for those who could handle it.- Space Combat - 3/10A huge disappointment. I would have rather they not even had space combat for launch and focused on giving us a quality space system down the road than release this. It's one of the few things TOR has to count as a feature not many other mmo's have, but they totally dropped the ball here. It's simple, it's boring, it's monotonous, it's Starfox.- U/I - 2/10Having played the beta, I figured there was no way they would release the game with the UI as it is.... but they did. I will say they are planning on improving it, so there is hope for the future with this. Still, releasing a 2012 MMO with a UI like this is almost insulting - there are literally almost 0 customization options with it and you can't even move your windows around. In general it's also quite cumbersome, as things like the Codex which you use frequently don't have they're own tab, so you must sift through other menus in order to get to it.- Character creation (race selection) - 1/10Another major disappointment in the game. First of all, your only choices of race or species are humans and basically..... more humans. For example, you can be a Zabrak (human with horns) or a Miralukan (human with blindfold on), or Cyborg (human with metal implants), etc etc. What a disappointment! For a game in the Star Wars universe and not being able to play as a Rodian, Bith, Ithorian, etc etc!- Character creation (appearance) - 3/10Your first choice is 1 of 4 body types, the 4th of which is a super fat guy which almost no one is going to want to be, so you have 3 options total for your height and size basically. Then you can choose from a handful of preset faces, half of which are just terrible. There are no sliders anywhere, everything is preset. There are ton of "complexion" options but those make very little change. Even the hair is disappointing - no long hair options for example. In general, it's another feature that is "just good enough", and another feature I'm shocked they didn't improve for release based on the massive amounts of beta feedback on this issue.**************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************- World immersion / atmosphere - 2/10The story in TOR is very immersive, but this isn't about that. When it comes to the actual game world itself, honestly speaking, I have never played a AAA mmo that I have felt LESS immersed in than TOR. I do not say that for shock value, it is the truth. This is actually the first time I've noticed such a thing as this to the point that I'm bringing it up in a review. There are a LOT of contributing factors to this, each of which individually may not be that big of a deal, but add them all up and you've got a world that feels static, lifeless, and kind of like a card board cutout of a world. Let's look at why this is.** 1A. - NPC's - NPC's in social hubs and cities are just "odd". There are a lot of NPC statues in TOR, more than most AAA mmo's I would venture to say. Some move, but in a very limited capacity usually, like move lightsaber up, then down, then up, then down, then up, then down, etc. Many also are just locked in place doing what SHOULD be an action, but it's like time just stopped for them (such as a Jedi in the middle of casting a force power and he just sits there forever halfway done with his cast, or 2 people about to duel but they never do, they just sit forever like they are ABOUT to duel or fight). It's extremely weird looking and out of place.** 1B. - NPC's - You cannot interact with npc's. There is no clicking on random npc's for a short 1 or 2 sentence chat. The only npc's you can interact with in the game are vendors and quest givers, so statue npc's seem even more statue like since you can't interact with them.** 1C. - NPC'S - Lack of npc chatter and ambient noise (NPC mimes). There are a few npc background chatter conversations in the game, but not many. You will however see a lot of groups of npc's that are in essence mimes. They will be interacting with each other through animated gestures, but there is no sound to go along with it. Also creates a very weird atmosphere as you may be in a city full of npc's, but it's quiet as a library if the music stops playing (which it does at certain intervals)** 2. - Mobs - There is very little pathing for mobs in this game. What I mean is, almost all mobs and groups just sit in place like statues, waiting for the slaughter. You will find a patrol here and there, but like the npc's, it is a rarity. Most mmo's have static groups of mobs, but I haven't seen it done to the degree that TOR does.** 3. - Critters / world creatures - Where are they? TOR is almost completely void of life besides for mobs and npc's. You will occasionally find a world creature like the beasts in the beginning of Tython, but they are very rare, and like the mobs and npc's, just stuck in place usually.** 4. - Sound - Cities and social hubs need a lot more ambient noise and sound effects. Almost every major city or quest hub feels like a library or morgue rather than a bustling hub of activity.** 5. - Zoning - The fact that TOR has zones within zones really hurts as well because even when a lot of players are on a server, it never truly feels busy, as the game just creates more instanced copies of the same zones.** 6. - Music - There are too many periods with no music playing. It's especially noticeable when you're in a city, because it emphasizes the lack of other sounds even more. It's not uncommon to be in a quest hub or area with lots of npc's but experience dead quiet if the music stops.** 7. - Weather - There are no dynamic weather cycles. Dromund always has a storm, but it ALWAYS has that storm. Key word dynamic. It's not a huge deal, but it doesn't help the immersion.** 8. - Day / night cycle - There is no day / night cycle. Some people care about that, others don't, but again, it doesn't HELP immersion by not having it.** 9. - No swimming - Same as day / night, debatable, but doesn't help.** 10. - Sitting in chairs - Can sit in chairs in your ship, but that's it folks. Another small one, but it factors in for some people.All of these things combined result in world with an extremely static and lifeless feel.**************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************- PVP - ??????I never pvp in games, so I can't comment on this aspect and won't attempt to talk about it without experience.- Miscellanous:** Guild functionality / features - 3/10 (completely bare bones guild set-up - although this is supposed to be getting addressed)** Galactic trade network (auction house) - 3/10 (needs A LOT of work)** Companions - 8/10 (fun feature and addition)** Music - 8/10 (good when it plays, but doesn't play often enough - too many periods of silence)** Map - 9/10 (loved the map, good job on this)** Extras - 8/10 (Datacrons, lore object finds and the Codex are enjoyable little extras)Overall - (2.5/5) - Chose to give 2 stars on Amazon.Bottom line - SWTOR is Star Wars + Bioware + years of hype, so I think most of us assumed it would be one of the highest quality mmo's of all time. SWTOR, for me, has been one of the biggest gaming disappointments I've ever experienced. I love Star Wars and Bioware games, so I thought this would be a lock as my MMO home for years or even decades in the future. I didn't think it would be possible for me to not like this game, but the longer I played the harder it became to ignore the shortcomings, to convince myself that I was having fun, that this was the high quality game it was hyped up to be. For each feature that is a step forward in QUALITY for the genre such as the story telling, it takes 5 steps that are either in place or going backward. Finally I just had to admit the reality of it, at least how it is to me:SWTOR is an amazing story telling experience, but not a very good game.
This is one of the most overhyped game I've seen. Commercials and trailers give the illusion of an epic game, but this game is no where near being epic. I asked a few folks to rate this game from a scale of 1-10. A lot of them gave it 9s or 10s. I asked if the graphics and gameplay was THAT great to justify for the high score and many of their responses were "yeah, but I rate it based on how I enjoyed it, but the game was filled with flaws especially the console version.So this review goes for the console version (x 360).I've spent about 70 hours altogether thoroughly exploring and taking my time playing the game and I have to say it is very similar to knights of the old republic and mass effect 1 in terms of control.The plot is similar to the typical medieval setting, reminds me a lot of lord of the rings because think: Dwarves, elves, orc like creatures? Dragons don't exactly help originality here. So for all those fanboys out there that rave about the game, I'm here to douse out your lame mediocre inducing flame about this game that is far from a 10, I mean it'll probably be a 10 if the highest score was 100.FLAWS (hopefully more patches will come out to alleviate some of these problems):UPDATE#11a. Just found another flaw to add to the list. You can't manually dodge attacks. Like in real life, if someone swings a sword at you and you back out of the range of the swing, it should miss you right? Not in this game. Spells follow you even though you move aside like it has a heat seeker built into it. The minute a melee character starts their attack on you, it's too late to even try to move aside because you can be 10ft away and the game will still register it as a hit. So try it, stand in front of a person with a sword and as soon as they start their swing, back off. You still get hit as you're running off....even if you're 5-10ft away...1b. I agree with those ppl that say the end battle is too hard. It is exceedingly harder than any battle you've faced in the game, especially to the average player lacking any outside help like faqs and guides. Even the hardest battles in the game is nothing compared to the end battle, so even if you feel like you're doing fairly well throughout the game, the end battle will catch you offguard. Ridiculously hard.UPDATE #2:Main character has no voice acting. Everyone else has it except you, why does this make no sense whatsoever?1. One of the biggest flaw in this game is the lack of exaggeration, facial and body animation and expression. No way can any game lack so much basic fundamental animation and still be declared anywhere above even a 6. Please play this game and see it for yourself. Example: You walk into your house and found everything gone. A real person would react in a sense of disbelief and a look of horror would be seen in their facial expression - a distortion of their facial features etc. Their body expression and movement would be an exaggerated by wild movements to the circumstance - flailing their arm about wildly, shaky legs due to fear, falling due to clumsiness caused by fear and not thinking correctly etc etc.However, in this game, the animation would be a significantly washed down version where the person's facial expression looks plain but with his mouth open at the most. He would stand there like a dope and the only further evidence of horror would be the yelling that came out of the hole in his face.Play this game and watch carefully at the animation. Look at their face and body movements. Now, pretend if you were in their circumstances or ask yourself: "How would a real person REALLY react if they were in that situation?"  Sorry, but this game is washed out. Graphics and animation in this game is done to the bare minimum.2. Graphics. Subpar at best, especially to the caliber of graphics there are nowadays. I'm not talking about the art, I'm pretty sure the game was suppose to look the way it's suppose to look currently, I'm talking about the quality of their graphics. The graphics in this game has not advance NEARLY far enough to justify any positive remarks to it. It is not even worth talking about. Smooth binding in the graphics is horrible. Watch as the characters walk, their legs go through their clothing sometimes. That is one of the most simplest and basic of mistakes and this game just takes the cake. To anyone that think the graphics is alright, check out other games that recently came out. GOOD GAMES, sorry but this game is a disgrace. Makes me want to get a PS3 just to play God of War 3, totally smash this game in every aspect. I know some PS1 games that'll still smash this game. Believe it or not, there's actually floating characters in this game. I've witnessed it twice, just noticing a character in town just floating 20 foot up in the air....3. Lame storyline. It has a typical plot, beginning through end. You basically play this whole game knowing the exact outcome of it. There are some variations, but the kind of twist this game has to offer is hardily worth a second glance into.4. Battle system for the console version is not smooth and I would find it hard to deal with especially during battles that require a smooth battling system. Lets all admit, lags and delays kill. Play the PC version if you can, it's significantly better in my personal opinion. Example would be you having to babysit after selecting a skill.  Usually when you play, if you choose a skill, you should be at least confident that your character will listen to your command and use the move. However, there is a slight delay and sometimes your character will ignore your commands to use it completely. Many times in this game you'll have to double or triple select moves to make sure they even use it. In the game you are also able to make your teammates hold their positions or follow you. However, changing between either will cause a slight delay in which all your characters are very temporarily stuck in place helpless. This isn't all that bad unless of course you have a horde of enemies on their way or already surrounding you, a one second delay or so can hurt you, especially when it happens over and over again.5. Can't delete save files in game.....you have to go into your system memory....I mean what the heck?6. This one is either me or maybe it is for everyone. I find the navigator for the map useless many times. You know the one that shows you where to go and stuff. Many times it doesn't. I would definitely like the type of quality objective navigation system found in Oblivion. I don't recall even being able to add navigational marks on the map to help me navigate it.7. There's some sexual content in this game, but oh boy is it corny and embarrassing.8. The game should be a bit more clear with choice outcomes, some in which will cause you to lose teammates. I mean losing a teammate that you mainly use a lot in most if not all of your battles is a very serious thing and I just think the game, even though it is RPG, should at least give you some hints at least when it comes to serious choices like that.9. Horrible character development. Throughout the game, I don't think you'll find one single character that you'll be really attached to other than using them in battle. Alistair, for one, is one of the most annoying characters in the game. If you were a woman character, you have the choice of romancing him. However, how can you romance a person that you want to hate so much? Play the game and find out. I'm glad it is just a game, too.10. When you gear up your character and you're not talking to them, you see their gear on them. But when you talk to them, suddenly all of their gear disappears and they appear in their default gear. This game is pact with these little flaws which in the end equals a giant big massive blunder.CONCLUSION:This game is fun in many ways, however, if I had the choice again I'd opt for the PC version. More angles to use, less game killing glitches, less obvious flaws, etc.After playing it, I have to say I'm sorely disappointed because I was expecting an epic game filled with epic boss battles. Sorry, but after you play God of War on the PS2, these games are just blah. They all need to learn the definition of EPIC-ness. Epic, in my book, means a moment that you'll always remember. A moment that put you in the edge of your seat, your heart beating fast, your eyes wide, your hands gripping remote. And when it is over, you have this good and bad feeling in you. Good cause you just played the most awesome and time worthy game ever and bad because it ended and you wanted more. This game just doesn't have that. I'm glad I'm through it, it was sort of fun, but boring many times.
I don't know where to start here. There are some pretty vast improvements in Dragon Age 2 (DA:2) compared to Origins (DA:O). Improvements I actually enjoyed and which I feel deserve praise. Namely the combat is far superior in DA:2. The strategy of the more turned-based style combat like in DA:O is still fully intact, but without the turn-based delay. It does give it a more hack-and-slash feel, but that is deceiving as the strategy and "special attacks" are still key components. I actually found myself needing to think and analyze a little more through some battles in this game as compared to the original.Unfortunately, I also have some qualms with the combat in this game. While it does require you to be a bit quicker in reacting in some cases after a while every battle starts to feel the same. This is because enemies level up as you do, and every battle is comprised of enemies of the essentially the same set of attributes as the previous enemies. To clarify take walking through the city at night when you first arrive in Kirkwall, by this time you are probably around level 5. You will be swarmed with around 10 enemies which range in two classes, ones with health bars it takes you 3 hits to completely kill (or one hit using a special attack playing as a rogue) or ones it takes about 10 hits to kill. Well at level 20 plus the same type of enemies will attack you and because they level with you it takes the same amount of hits to kill one enemy. So using the exact same strategy you worked out in the first few hours of the game you breeze through almost every fight and your 500th fight seems just like a carbon copy of your first fight. It gets pretty monotonous after a while and boring to the point you start hoping you won't even run into any enemies.The graphics in this game are beautiful. DA:O's were decent, but far from beautiful really. IThat unfortunately is where my list of improvements ends. Though even that wouldn't be bad IF other elements of the game were even at least close to being on par with DA:O. Here my biggest gripe is the story...or should I say lack thereof. Obviously a story of sorts is being told in this game, but it lacks one key element, literary conflict. Literary conflict is used no matter what type of story being told from comedy to drama to horror to drive the plot forward. DA:2 has virtually none. What this leaves you with is a game full of rather meaningless tasks to complete to get from one point to the next. I actually thought I would hate the narrative story telling they chose to do here, but that part worked, was done well and was the high point of the game's lacking story. So it isn't that they decided to tell a story in a different way from Bioware's typical format that I disliked, it was that there was no real story.Don't get me wrong there is story of sorts here and it is supposed to be about the role you played in lead up to the mage uprising/rebellion. But this is not really built upon in any real way to create literary conflict in a build up to the crescendo of events of the game's finale. Apart from the last few hours of play the whole mage thing really just seems like an annoying component to the game. What I mean is there is an obvious conflict with the mages being mentioned throughout the game, but I am not given any reason to care either way about it and to be honest I really didn't and still don't care about it. That is where the literary conflict is missing. Nothing is built into the overall story to make me care about it and the first two "acts" of the game aren't even dealing with this issue in any way except to have mages and mage-haters whining incessantly.Then there is the "world" itself. You will explore every inch of every part of the "world" in this game in the first 5 to 6 hours, then you'll spend the next 30 or so hours bouncing back and forth back and forth between these same 10 or so, rather small areas. Each area is VERY small, and I am not sure why this is. I mean you can literally go through the entire map of an area (minus the time for battles and/or conversations of course) in around a minute. Therefore you are going to set through hundred and hundreds of fairly long load screens. This becomes almost unbearable given there feels like there is no real point (because of the lack of any real conflict in the story) for you even playing the game. I mean I was glued to the screen playing DA:O. I lamented that I had to work as I couldn't wait to get to the next point in the game, but at the same time not wanting it to end. Playing this game I seriously couldn't wait for it to be over and had this not been a Bioware game and had I not been one of the biggest Bioware fanboys of all time I wouldn't have even been able to finish this game. I seriously had no desire to even play it really after the first few hours.Even to talk to your companions you have to go to each one's "home" and talk to them there. So you have to sit through even more load screens just to interact with and they all a different "home" except for two being in the same place. At least Mass Effect had everone on the same ship (base), even if you had to go to each one's room to speak with them. I also think the companion's in this game lack any real depth to them. It is more about having them there solely for quests. Before I felt a connection to them and actually got giddy at the cameos from my DA:O companions, but the companions in this one don't seem to be interesting but definitely have more quests but no depth of character. I did a lot of running around and killing for these guys but could careless about any of them really (though Isabella is one of the hottest video game characters of all time in my opinion). They weren't that interesting and neither was any of their stories and could've cared less about battling and killing some of them in the end. They meant nothing to me, where as I couldn't finish my DA:O play through when Anora had Alistair executed when I wanted to make her queen.I don't know what Bioware was thinking here, but this whole game seems amateurish compared their known ability in crafting an excellent story and characters. I seriously would not have finished this game had it not been a Bioware game and even being a Bioware fanboy I can't give this game even a decent mediocre rating. Without a doubt the core reason for this is because of the incomplete story that lacks the main ingredient of any story...conflict. Without conflict the story doesn't move forward and I think Bioware thought they could get away with this because the narration would be used to push the story forward in between "actb", but seriously that fell flat and failed miserably. Even with narration the story itself must have and build upon the conflict and that just doesn't happen at all with this game and therefore it becomes tedious and outright boring to play especially with the repetitiveness of the battles, continual repeats of the same areas being used/visited and seemingly endless load screens that must be endured. As a Bioware fanboy I must admit this game is honestly borderline unplayable and is definitely not a game that has any replay value at all. DA went from epic with Origins to boring and virtually unplayable in this installment. Absolutely horrible Bioware and I pray your writers get their stuff together real darn quick...or did EA make you get rid of /run out all the good ones already perhaps?
I walked away from the original Crysis fairly impressed and eagerly looking forward to jumping into the sequel to see what else developer Crytek could come up with. What I found was a game that had nearly everything I loved about Crysis either removed or changed in a way that took enjoyment out of the experience. This was once a fairly unique shooter now feels like a run of the mill FPS experience with some minor nanosuit abilities tacked on to give it a "Crysis-like-feel". Honestly this is the first time I've felt like consoles being tossed into the mix for development actually held a project back from achieving something far better.Again I'll start with the visuals, which were pretty good but I didn't quite get hit with the wow factor from the original. Trading in the island paradise we find ourselves in a half destroyed New York City which makes for some impressive sights but overall I felt like I wasn't experiencing anything new. Playing on DX9 with everything set at Ultra was still a treat but I didn't find myself stopping to marvel at things. DX11 offered a far better visual treat but due to poor resource management on Crytek's part which often resulted in random slow down due to the over use of tessellation on objects you could see, I opted to go with DX9 for majority of the game. I never got the sense that this game was designed to push the limits in terms of visuals the way the original did. While the visuals were great it just wasn't what I was expecting after playing through Crysis from 2007.As I stated earlier this time we're playing in New York City shortly after the events of Crysis, which finds Prophet handing off his nanosuit to new comer Alcatraz. This poor guy is having a string of bad luck, after nearly dying when the submarine he is on is sunk in the Hudson River he's then blasted by the Ceph before being found by Prophet. After being infected by a virus that has wiped out most of New York's inhabitants Prophet puts the barely alive Alcatraz in the nanosuit then offs himself before he can explain anything. When Alcatraz awakens he finds that everyone hates Prophet and wants him dead; what's worse is that now everyone thinks he is Prophet. Now Alcatraz must take up Prophet's mission and finish what he started.Despite being given the nanosuit from Prophet who was the team leader in the original Crysis the suit is quite different for this outing. In fact I'm going to use the term dumb downed to describe it because that is the best I can come up with. Gone is Power mode, instead activating automatically when you need it. Hold down any action you want to do in order to activate Power mode though it mainly seems to be used for jumping and the occasional power kick to move a car or something else blocking your path. Speed is also gone which is now simply activated by holding down the sprint key. Honestly it feels like a normal sprint and there's no sense of incredible speed that Crysis had. Even though it is slower it still drains your energy supply fairly quickly, majority of the time when I truly needed it my energy was already low and I lacked any other form of increased movement. Cloak is still the same with some minor tweaks to how quickly it drains your energy and Armor mode is still the same as well. So in short you've lost Power and Speed mode while keeping Cloak and Armor. Gone is the satisfaction of using this abilities to together as everything is either activated automatically or doesn't serve much of a purpose.Moving past that minor complaint I found the game riddled with more changes or things simply being kicked out entirely. While the game still allows you to tackle objectives using whatever means you deem necessary the area size you play in is far smaller and extremely linear. Crysis 2 would try to be helpful by pointing out different "tactical options" though I wonder how tactical it is to run out in the open and grab a ledge to get to higher ground where everyone will see me. It didn't take long before I started ignoring that little voice in favor of doing it my way which usually revolved around the concept of start at point A and kill everything in my path on my way to point B. It doesn't allow you to branch off much as you are often limited to city streets or roof tops, the occasional shop being open for you to duck into though rarely would they have a way around back or anything like that. Again this felt like a huge drawback from the original and left me wondering why they thought this was a better design choice. I loved it when I would fail in Crysis because that meant I'd be trying out something entirely new by taking a completely different path and trying to find a weakness in my enemy to exploit. This time dying meant I was pretty much going to replay that same section in the same manner. Very rarely does Crysis 2 give you a good sized area to play in that allows you to experiment and explore.Crysis 2 also features some of the worst AI I've ever encountered. Enemies/squadmates would get hung up on walls, would throw grenades against barriers they were hiding behind then stand there until it exploded, often my squadmates would ignore blatant danger while attempting to relocate for some reason. Plenty of times I found myself stopping to marvel at the stupidity going on around me. Other times it was easy to get enemies caught in a loop for animations. This means I would shoot one of the Ceph or Cell soldiers and it would send them sprawling to the ground then pop back up in the same spot a split second later. So I would keep my cross hairs in one spot, firing every other second to keep hitting them for an easy kill. Not very often did I feel challenged by the AI. Most of the time the challenge came from having to deal with a boss like creature using limited supplies (you need four rocket launchers to blow up the walking tank, you only have three) while an endless amount of Ceph spawn in the area. Even then it wasn't so much challenging as it was time consuming. One example of this would be in Times Square where you are defending a location while civilians are being evacuated. The Ceph arrive to attack and eventually they drop in one of their walking tanks. By this point your squadmates have blown themselves up so it is just you attempting to take this thing down while Ceph continuously spawn off to the side. So after hitting the walking tank with my three rockets I detached a mounted .50 in order to finish the job but had to constantly put it down to kill the two or three Ceph that had spawned in. What made this process even slower was the walking tank would send out a blast that drains my suit energy completely making it impossible for me to stand there firing at it. This felt like an exercise in patience more so than it did testing my skills.The story line here was a fair bit better than the original, letting you interact with key characters more often and keeping you in the loop about what was going on. Alcatraz's nanosuit is basically mankind's last hope against the Ceph and is the key to undoing the plague unleashed upon New York. As you play through you find out a fair amount about the Ceph and the war that is unfolding in New York, how they are here to claim Earth and wipe out every last human. It's not the best story I've experienced but still was entertaining enough to keep me chugging through a mediocre game.Gun play is tight and the weapons feel just right. Again the sound quality here is excellent and helps draw you into the world. Your weapons take center stage with it comes to audio as you hear shell casings hitting the ground, the click of the bolt feeding another round into the chamber, the clang when your clip is empty, the sound echoing off the buildings around you. This was one area I was truly impressed and Crytek raised the bar here over Crysis. The soundtrack was fitting, the voice acting was great, and there isn't much I can think of to complain about here.Another major change was the Ceph, as they are no longer anything like what you saw in Crysis. Gone are the tentacled half alien half machine monsters which proved quite challenging to battle as they could fly, move quickly, and were quite deadly up close. What we have in their place are humanoid versions of the Ceph which are half alien half machines, running around on two legs like all the other enemies in the game. Why this was changed again I cannot make heads or tails about. There wasn't much of a difference between fighting the Cell or fighting the Ceph beyond the weapons they were firing at you and enemy type. It came off as lazy in my opinion since the Ceph from Crysis were new and original this time around it just felt like a reskinned human soldier with some better weapons.Overall I just found that Crysis 2 didn't live up to what I expected and didn't continue building upon the great foundation laid by Crysis. Pointless changes, limited scope, and horrible enemy AI really held this game back from being truly great. Instead we got a middle of the road FPS with some exceptional qualities but issues that mar the experience into the realm of mediocrity. I hope Crytek rethinks their strategy for their next game in the Crysis series because this didn't leave me impressed. Clocking in at just under 8 hours for the campaign as well left me a little let down since the original took me closer to 15+ hours to complete. I'm giving Crysis 2 a 6.5 out of 10.
It seems EA will never fix their obvious AI problems.  Yet each year they add more gimmicks without fixing one of the main problems in their football game.I haven't bought Madden since Madden 03, and I will not buy another Madden title until they fix the AI problems.  I am sick of having CPU's sub par running backs breaking 5 and 6 tackles on 3rd and 6 just so they can get a first down.  QBs breaking tackles from LBs who outweight them by 100 pounds.  How about the CPU always allowing your CB's to be out of position when the CPU passes the ball, and on top of that, they slow the CB down to give the receiver a better chance to catch the ball!  Sub par receivers making leaping one handed catches in tight coverage while getting hit.  Passes going through defenders' bodies, helmets, hands, legs, arms etc. to end up in the receiver's hands.  Balls changing direction in mid air just so the receiver can catch it.  The CPU intentionally making tacklers dive in the opposite direction you expect them to, turning a would be minimal 2 or 3 yard gain into a maddening 20 yard gain.  Your defenders all seem to be conntected by a string so if you go in and dive to make a sack and miss (and most of the time you will miss or the QB will miracously break the tackle), your defender who is guarding the intended receiver, will automatically dive too if you switch to him, resulting in a BS 50+ yard TD pass.  The CPU automatically moving your linemen across the line on 3rd and 10, to give the offense a free 5 yard and then the CPU gets exactly 5 yards on the next play.  CPU QB's getting off perfect passes while having a LB inches from taking him down.If your offense you have to deal with your all star 95+ rated receivers dropping wide open passes.  All star QBs throwing balls out of bounds. All star RB's fumbling at the worse possible time.  You lineman are moved across the line by the CPU and you get flagged for a false start.  Your linemen miss obvious blocks so big gains are rare in a close game. Your QB automatically tucks the ball and takes a sack if a defender is 10 feet away, while the CPU QB can get a perfect pass off while he's being sacked almost.  Psychic defense that almost always know what play your going to run.  Refs almost always get in the way of your receiver when you absolutely need to convert a 3rd down.And who can forget the infamous comeback AI?  No lead is safe.  Even if your up by 20+ points at the half, your better off running the clock out starting in the 3rd quarter because the AI will do any and everything to get the lead and screw you; that includes your offense fumbling the ball, receivers dropping wide open passes, refs constantly calling clipping and holding on you after you get a good punt return or big gain.  Refs calling you for face mask penalties or pass interference after you stop the CPU on third down so the CPU can get a free first down, bad calls in the final two minutes of the game so you can't challenge.On special teams I have seen where I was lined up for the game winning field goal and I see my play clock is about to run out, so I call a timeout with 2 seconds left on the clock. The screen signals that I called a timeout, but a few moments after I call a timeout, the ref throws a flag AFTER the timeout was called. and I get pushed back five yards. Talk about a LATE whistle. Another occasion the CPU punted to me, and the ball CLEARLY went out of bounds at the 35 yard line. It was way beyond the side line and in fact nearly to the end of the thick white line; however the ball bounced back in bounds and the CPU downed it at the 21 yard line. I was so shocked, that I saved the replay. No matter what this CPU does to screw me, they always do one better everytime I play the game.I have experienced these things and more in Madden.  More so on defense.  while these problems certainly don't happen in every game, it happens on average every other game.  Sometimes the CPU will cheat on every single down making it impossible to win. Most of the time however, I can usually still win in spite of the cheating, it is still very frustrating when the CPU can constantly pull 60, 70 and 80 YD TD passes out their a$$ just so the game will be close.  This ruins the experience of an otherwise fun game.  I still play 2003, because I want to at least get my money's worth and play all 30 seasons while drafting college players from NCAA 2003.  After that, I will never even think about purchasing or playing another Madden or NCAA title again.For me, gone are the days that I rush out and buy the current year's sports title.  It is usually the same game as the previous one.  However, if you absolutely want a football title this year, get ESPN, and while it has its problems too, it is certainly a much better deal being only 20 bucks versus 50 bucks for Madden.Since the folks at EA are shaking in the fear of a little competition from ESPN, they have decided to purchase the NFL liscense exclusively for themselves so no other companies can make NFL games.  Because of this I suppose I won't be buying any football titles for the next 5 years.  Even IF EA fixed their obvious game problems during these 5 years, I STILL wouldn't buy Madden or NCAA ever again.  I don't even know if I will buy another EA game period.  I am sorry I just can't support any company that buys their way out of competition.  So long EA!

For adults, the James Perkins review of Black and White nails this game.  Read it, then skip purchasing this game.  I was very excited about getting it after reading/believing the hype.  The creature and its &quot;leashes&quot; drove me insane, and detracted from the small amount of entertainment I had begun having from solving the puzzles in the game.  Maneuvering is (IMHO) counter-intuitive, especially which way the POV revolves based on the sliding of the mouse.  And the forced tutorial is mind-numbing.  The only worse &quot;forced&quot; passage in a game is the part of NOLF where you have to ask the fat industrialist all of those inane questions.

this is one of the most overrated piles of tripe ive ever playedthe graphics are pretty but you'll need a pretty hefty card and processor to get the most out of them. my voodoo3 450mhz struggled almost constantlythe gamneplay, although hyped up something massive is dull at best. it just boils down to the people want wood so put some trees in the store. the people want food so put some food in the store. the other god wants you to get more land, put food and wood in another village's store. etc...sound is good but it doesnt reallt matter considering the rest of the game is so dullthe creatures although made to seem like real children are boring and essentially boils down to ape picks up man, god slaps ape, ape goes &quot;ooh&quot;, ape picks up another man. etc... i suppose eventually the ape will learn not to pick up the man but you'll have flogged this game by then.my rating: zipmaybe 4/5 if you coiuld use the cd as a coaster maybe

This game recieved a colossal amount of hype, and from all the hyperbole, was destined to be as large of a step forward in gaming as Populous, also created by Peter Molyneaux.Instead, we have an orangutan flinging feces while peasants starve at the temple because you forgot to dump grain every 30 seconds.I am a huge fan of open-architecture games. I am very excited about AI in gaming on a philosophical level. I was profoundly disappointed.It is true, my animal learned. And my animal seemed to think. But, and this is the crux of it, my animal was EXTREMELY BORING.city maintenance was the essence of tedium. picking up trees one by one and placing them into the lumber depot = not fun. Teaching my pet to do this for me = not fun. Fighting other creatures = not fun.Additionally, encountering the level that reverese ALL THE TRAINING YOU HAVE DONE TO YOUR CREATURE = wiping it off my computer. I have heard that there was a patch to remedy that particular insult to injury, but I do not care. My creature was already damaged goods.So. If you have a friend who wants to hand you a copy for free, give it a shot. Sometimes your pet will be interesting. Some of the spells are pretty. But honestly, this is not worth purchasing.

Catwoman is one of those games that gives licensed properties a bad name-something really depressing as movie-based titles were starting to gain respectability with The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay and Spider-Man 2. No, Catwoman fumbles the ball-from the moment you press start there's nothing but frustration. You play as Patience, a woman left for dead, but instead of pushing up daisies, she's revived/saved/resurrected by cats. Somehow her small furry saviors imbue her with cat-powers (or something like that), which translate into a limited repertoire of flailing punch-kick moves, expertise with a whip, and other purchasable powers that are available as the game progresses. Catwoman commits every action-adventure platform-jumper crime imaginable: lousy camera angles, incomprehensible level designs, and a lame combat engine. And for an agile character, there's really nothing stealthy about her: enemies mindlessly charge, and no matter how you slice it, one really shouldn't have to spend endless hours trying to repeatedly make a near-impossible jump. The awkward controls don't help much, either. Actions are primarily limited to the triggers and analog sticks, and combat is an infuriating visual mess thanks to the camera that has a mind of its own. Unfortunately, Catwoman will surface on store shelves before this review appears. Too bad: unaware purchasers of this title will probably quickly relegate it to the litter box.

I've had this game for a few months now. At first I loved it. Learning about each individual element of the game (e.g., the miracles, the creature, the villagers, the islands, the opposing gods) was fun and promised for exciting gameplay. Unfortunately, knitting all of the elements together into a comprehensive whole is one area where Black &amp; White needs work. For instance, in order to accomplish anything, you are forced to &quot;increase your influence&quot;--that is, you cannot interact directly with any area of the island that is not under your influence. To gain influence, you have to demonstrate to the neighboring villagers that you are a powerful god by tossing rocks, trees, people, fireballs, whatever over their heads so they fear and/or are amazed by you. This becomes very tedious. It takes ages to gain the influence you need and the process to gain it is not very fun.Alas, I wanted so much to love this game, but it's just too repetitive and slow.

As anyone reading this review is doubtless aware, this game is based on the third installment in the Harry Potter movie franchise, which is in turn based off the third book in the Harry Potter series.  This one concerns the third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley as they attend class, learn new spells, fight various enemies, and - by the way - deal with the fact that the notorious wizard criminal, Sirius Black, has escaped from Azkaban prison with the intent to murder young Mr. Potter, and he is being pursued by Dementors, which are Ringwraith-like creatures that act as prison guards and they are intent on recapturing Sirius Black, and woe to anyone who gets in their way.This is my second foray into the world of Harry Potter gaming.  About a year ago I played Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, which was a great (though not perfect) game with a well-realized, immersive Hogwarts, lots of challenging combat, fun sidequests and mini-games, Quidditch matches, good-looking graphics, and engaging puzzles.  I went in to Prisoner of Azkaban expecting more of the same.  I was rudely shocked, to say the least.But before I get into the negative, let's talk about the positive.  In this game, you control Harry, Ron, and Hermione at various times, and each of the three has different strengths and abilities.  Harry has access to the Marauder's Map, which allows you to see mini-maps or the levels, complete with secret passageways and locations of other characters and enemies.  Harry is also able to jump gaps, climb ropes, and is generally the most acrobatic of the trio.  Ron can find secret doors and items.  Hermione can access tight spaces that the others can't.  In addition, though this game offers many spells to be learned and used, most of them can only be used by one or another of the three characters (though the basic spells are common to all three).  All of this does make for a more varied gameplay experience, and adds a certain amount of depth to the (still too easy) puzzle-solving.  Another positive thing about the game is the Expecto Patronus spell, which allows Harry to conjure up a Patronus to use against the Dementors.  This is very well done and is the most enjoyable thing in the game, although controlling the Patronus effectively will take some getting used to.  But that's about it as far as positives go.Combat in this game is much easier than before.  Your Expelliarmus spell for defense will almost never be used.  The basic approach to any enemy is just cast Filipendo at it over and over again until it goes down.  This is complicated by the fact that your lock-on targeting system in clearly flawed in this game, as many times you will attempt to target an enemy and lock on to an inanimate object instead.  A couple of the enemies are slightly more challenging, but for the post part it is just point and shoot.  This even applies to the several times you will encounter Draco Malfoy in the game.  Malfoy is no more difficult to defeat than any other enemy in the game.  This doubtless makes the game easier for young players, but it was a disappointment for me.The puzzles in the game are very easy for the most part.  They are made even easier by the fact that the characters will continuously shout out things like "I wonder what that button does, maybe you should push it!" or "Hey Ron, why don't you cast Lumos Duo on that object over there?" or other such things.  So if you should ever experience some momentary hesitation about what to do next, don't worry - the game will spill the beans quickly enough.The most annoying thing about the game is the fact that, whichever of the three characters you are playing, the other two will constantly run along behind you shouting unhelpful and annoying remarks.  For example, when you have completed all the tasks assigned to you for a level, but you need to explore the castle a bit, the characters will gripe about how tired they are and how they want to go to bed approximately every 5 seconds.  Or if you should ever deviate from the shortest path through a level, they will start spouting off about how you're going the wrong way.  This will drive you insane in a hurry.  I can't believe EA thought this was a good idea.  At the least you should have an option to turn the voices off.The mini-games in this game are dull to say the least.  As I said before, there is no Quidditch, in fact you don't touch a broomstick in the game.  Yes, you do get to fly Buckbeak aimlessly around the castle grounds if you desire, but this is a very poor substitute.  The other mini-games are pointless and boring, and one of them, Owl Racing, was apparently deisgned as torture for your fingers, since you have to tap a button over and over again in a precise rhythm for several minutes in order to make your owl flap her wings and fly.  I did it one time and never again, since I don't particularly enjoy finger cramping.Graphically and sound-wise the game is also below par.  Most of the characters look and sound nothing like their movie counterparts.  The worst is Professor Snape.  I don't know who did his voice acting, but they could have gotten the guy who does Spongebob Squarepants and it would have sounded better.  Of course, you don't hear much of his voice anyway, since every time you encounter him outside of Potions class in the game, he will look at you and immediately go into a fit of coughing and hacking - bascially Snape has a year-long bout of emphysema in this game.  What is up with that?You spend far too much time in this game staring at loading screens.  Every time you open a door, even to enter the tiniest room - loading screens.  Running from outside the front door of Hogwarts to Gryffindor tower takes about 2 minutes of play time and about 90 seconds of staring at a loading screen.  This is far too much, and EA really needs to fix this recurring problem in their Potter games.  Other simiar games don't have this problem, why should this one?  It certainly isn't the great graphics.Outdoors is another disappointment.  Yes, you can fly Buckbeak over a complete version of Hogwarts, but, except for the relocated front door, it is the exact same building and grounds layout as in the last game.  In addition, in the last game, the grounds were inhabited by lots of students running around the castle, which did a lot for the immersion factor of the game.  Here, there is no one outside at all.  It's almost enough to make you feel lonely, running over the huge grounds all alone.  Also, in previous games, exploring the grounds and castle had a purpose - there were secret items all over the place waiting to be found.  Here, there is nothing beyond one or two chests with Wizard cards.  Outdoor exploration was one of the best things about Chamber of Secrets, but in this game it is yet another disappointment.Overall, this game let me down severely.  It's like EA decided that, since the Harry Potter games were intended for younger players and Chamber of Secrets might have been too difficult for them, they decided to make Prisoner of Azkaban much easier and get rid of all the fun and challenge and, in the process, most of the "Hogwarts" atmosphere.  (Although, young kids will probably have a lot of trouble with the Patronus spell).  Unless you just have to play every game with the Potter name on it, avoid this one.  Play Chamber of Secrets instead.  Let's hope that Goblet of Fire is better.

This will be an interesting review... I think they HP games get better as they go along... Im sure it was an ok game for its time, but im not too interested in this game at all -~~~~1st parts of the game = A couple cutscenes (too many!), good to catch up not-familiar journeyers to the world of HP, but dont provide a lot of information (kinda hit and miss)!~~~~First controlled levels = Really weird... i ddnt recognize Hogwarts very well, controls are kinda clunky(maybe thats because I have played all of the newer ones?~~~~First impression of this Hogwarts = Well, we DO know that Hogwarts only gets better as the games progress... This Hogwarts was kinda weird, but at the same time was interesting and was filled with stuff~~~~Spells = Learning spells can be tedious, and the challenges are a pain!

This will be an interesting review... I think they HP games get better as they go along... Im sure it was an ok game for its time, but im not too interested in this game at all -~~~~1st parts of the game = A couple cutscenes (too many!), good to catch up not-familiar journeyers to the world of HP, but dont provide a lot of information (kinda hit and miss)!~~~~First controlled levels = Really weird... i ddnt recognize Hogwarts very well, controls are kinda clunky(maybe thats because I have played all of the newer ones?~~~~First impression of this Hogwarts = Well, we DO know that Hogwarts only gets better as the games progress... This Hogwarts was kinda weird, but at the same time was interesting and was filled with stuff~~~~Spells = Learning spells can be tedious, and the challenges are a pain! Doing spells in general is much too simple, but it IS geared toward younger people, so i cant complain~~~~Unlockables = Kind of a whatever feeling, i feel like i just get them and there arent many things to get with them (there isnt that wow factor of gaining them)~~~~Quidditch Confessions ;) = Well....

Parents, don't be fooled. This game is a monumental joke. Kids are our future. And you will crush their spirits if you give them this nightmare. In all honesty, this is the worst game I've played in the last two generations of gaming.It's a sham on so many levels. A Harry Potter 3rd person shooter? What a wonderful idea! Just wrap your head around the absurdity of this. Harry Potter defeating hordes of enemies (I defeated over 1000 in my first playthrough!), armed with his trusty wand. Better watch out, Uncharted 2! Ugh.Of course, the enemies Harry Potter fights are the most uninspired lot imaginable. A hearty "Hip, hip, hooray!" to genericity. There might be 5 human enemy models in the game. Seriously. There's the glasses kid (you remember him, right?). There's some dude in a dirty white coat (he was a major star in the movie!). There's some guy in a black robe. There's some kid in a hat. That's about all I remember. Add to that thrilling spiders and weird fairy/imps, and you've got quite a rogue's gallery, assuming you're both blind and stupid. The graphics are so poor that you won't be able to make out any facial features of these blobs as they accost you left and right. You might as well be fighting some enemy from the NES.Speaking of graphics, they are a joke all around. This game would be poor by PS2 standards. Harry Potter looks like his face was crushed in a press or something. Hermione's mouth doesn't even try to move correctly as she speaks. Ron just looks like some weird, red gorilla. Backdrops are bland and insipid, with horribly washed-out colors. Even worse, the same environments are recycled over and over.Battle itself is a joke. The game comes equipped with three difficulties. As far as I could tell, they were pretty much the same (on "Hard," enemies hunted you more aggressively if they found you during stealth missions, but that's about it). The only challenge in this game (for anyone over the age of 7) comes from the myriad glitches present. Enemies will shoot you through cover (in one humorous instance, an enemy shot me through a wall). Fairy/imps (I think they're called "Doxies") will accost you continually as your "Doxicide" passes right through them (I had to just throw the bottles at the wall behind me). Even though you may think your wand is locked onto an enemy, enjoy as your spells miss them continuously as they run with no purpose back and forth.I had hoped to give this game one redeeming point in regards to collectables. After all, there are a lot of them in the game. Moreover, with names like "Daily Prophet" and "Quibbler," you'd think you would at least have some fun reading through these papers. Well, sorry to disappoint. Each collectable you pick up opens...one line of text. No image of a paper with a moving character on the front. Not even a full article. You get one line of text telling you what the fictitious article is about, assuming you could read it. Come on.Exploration is completely absent in this bomb. The game in completely linear. Move here, do this. Humorously, there is a spell you can cast to tell you where to go. Hilariously, it will often lead you on a wild goose chase back and forth across a level, even as it is described as being "the most efficient path". Half the time, you can't even cast it for some odd reason I never figured out in three playthroughs.There are online challenges, but the servers have such a lag that you can expect to wait up to two days before your scores show up. The online challenges are just the same stale gameplay you've come to know and loathe (with one exception - I found the timed stealth challenges to be interesting enough to rate merely "bad").Finally, the plot of the game is utterly incomprehensible. Of course, I would imagine that most people already know the story here, but if you actually pay attention, you'll see that nothing is explained whatsoever. I don't know if this was released prior to the movie, so they didn't want to give away plot points or what.If there is a silver lining, trophy hunters can expect to get the platinum for this game in around 10-15 hours. On easy mode, the quest can be completed in as little as 2-2.5 hours.This is a game that kids play for about an hour and say, "Uhhh, thanks Mom. I'm going outside now." Maybe this is the way to finally drive your kids away from the TV. If you're an adult and you like this, well, you're hopeless. If you must have a Harry Potter game, look to Lego Harry Potter, or even Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (which, while pretty lousy, at least had some interesting components). This isn't even worth $5, in my humble opinion. I thank God that Gamestop has a liberal return policy for used games.
Let me get straight to the point.  This game blows and is in my estimation, an early candidate for worst game of the year.  The history of Harry Potter hasn't always been a good one.  They have ranged from fair to acceptable, but have never really reached the heights of imagination from the rich source material that they came from.  However, you could not deny that they were each good, solid efforts with the next iteration improving from the one before it.  Then comes Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1.  Gone are the free roaming explorations of Hogwarts.  This time Harry and friends are on the run.  And with this one bold plot course in the book, goes any semblence of a decent Harry Potter game.  What developer EA Bright Light did so well in the previous game in terms of sandbox gaming is now replaced by a clunky third person shooter.  This gameplay change could have been a welcomed divergence to the previous games if only were the mechanics not so broken.You start off playing as Harry with one main spell that eventually swells to half a dozen or so while progressing through the game.  I'm okay with the variety, yet I never found myself using anything other than the stupify spell which seemed more effective against enemies.  There is a cover mechanic yet good luck finding a barrier to hide behind that will stick and keep you from getting hit with spell projectiles.  The lock on mechanic is slippery and you'll often find yourself casting spells at empty air when it was focused on an enemy a second ago. Even more odd is that in some parts of the game, the view will shift from a third person perspective to a first person perspective without any rhyme or reason other than the developers trying to shake up the dull gameplay.  There was one instance in the game that literally had me tearing my hair out.  Harry is hidden under his invisibility cloak and must sneak around to accomplish a mission without being discovered.  Once the mission is over, Harry must then sneak back to the original point in which he started in order to trigger a cut scene.  The difficulty level then spikes and all of a sudden you're being discovered without anyone near you.  I must have tried this level a dozen or so times before I finally got past it, yet I have no idea if it was due to my skill or just chance.The graphics are equally bad.  Though Harry, Hermione and Ron look detailed enough, they inhabit a world of muddy textures and dull environments.  The cut scenes seemed rushed and unfinished and failed to stitch together any semblence of a coherent plot.  Harry is given a mission to find the remaining Horcruxes, yet he then must partake in side missions that involve him sneaking out of a dragon's lair (don't ask how he got there), rescuing muggles and freeing captured wizards.  Weird.I never expected a great Harry Potter game, but I could always expect a competent one that offered me a couple hours of fun as a fan of the series.  Deathly Hallows completely flipped the formula and instead offered a game so ugly and crippled by its gameplay mechanics that it's a shame that the best book in the series could not serve as inspiration for a good game.  There is a couple of months for the developer to correct their mistakes before the second part of this game is released in July of 2011 but I'm not holding my breath.
In fact, I'm pretty sure it isn't.But being a huge fan of The Sims and Sims2, I thought I'd buy it because living in a huge city, I hoped it would parallel and be fun -- Sims-style.Ugh. It is so not.If you're one of those people, like me, who hate going out to big clubs and watching people fawn (fake-fake-fake!) over some celeb-du-jour or some musician, or someone who's SOMEONE ... ugh ... then this game isn't for you.It's about ladder climbing, and about who you know, not what you know. It's about kissing butt (something I have a hard time doing), and being a "player" ....This is beyond my generation. I think teenagers and maybe young adults into their early 20s might like this game. Or anyone who likes playing THE game -- then give it a shot.Otherwise, don't waste your money.

- Operation Avalanche will never yield you anything more than a 3-star rating on any difficulty. There's not enough enemies to earn you the points.- Operation Varsity: your first encounter with the MG-42 wielding soldier in the train yard (on Expert difficulty) is nearly impossible to survive by making a run for cover before otherwise getting ambushed from all sides by the enemy if you choose to stay crouched behind the crate. That said, a five-star rating is extremely difficult to acquire unless you press ESC and quickly reload your last checkpoint right before you die.- The enemy AI is flawed - by this I mean they shake, convulse and twitch when you take the Springfield and zoom-in on static (not dynamic) enemy troops such as snipers or enemies behind cover.- Some weapon upgrades are completely nonsensical such as the faster holster-draw on the .45 pistol or the scope on the STG-44,..- The reload on the pump-action shotgun is ridiculous, as per each shot the gun is pointed upward to jack out the spent shell and load a fresh one into the chamber. It's poor form.- The BAR rifle goes from bad to worse with the upgrades as the zoom increases when you aim down your sights and the recoil already bad as it is that bumps the rifle upward making it that much more difficult to deal with.- The MP40 submachinegun after all the upgrades comes with a 64 rnd magazine but the Thompson's with the drum magazine only allows for 50 rounds. Before the 2nd upgrade to the Thompson's, the muzzle flash is a nuisance and unrealistic as hell unless you were firing it in pitch darkness. A 64rnd single-stack magazine on the MP40 is a goofy upgrade.- The last two levels of the game, every enemy soldier is packing an STG-44 which makes it nearly redundant to take something other than an STG-44 into these maps because there's no other ammo lying around anywhere save for a couple large green containers that will restock your supplies just once.These facts aside, at least the levels were unique and eye-catching. However, that doesn't allow AIRBORNE to save face.:
Put Harry Potter in Gauntlet Legends and give him a talking Tinker Bell in a bottle and you've got Night Caster. There's no real plot except get through the levels. Until you get to the end of the game the spells [stink]and all the while villagers and an Irish Miss Cleo are whining at you. The graphics have no detail, which makes the game look like it is a 64 game. Like most Xbox games it's not long but everything along the way will annoy you. Better for younger players.

El juego no es malo, pero me siento TOTALMENTE decepcionado. Soy comprador de FIFA desde el 2007 y esta entrega se la vendi a un amigo porque me parecio una falta de respeto TOTAL a los usuarios del juego.Como primera medida, las diferencias entre el FIFA 2011 y el 2012 a nivel de juevo NO SON tantas como anuncian, salvo detalles, el resto es mas marketing que otra cosa.Por otro lado y el PEOR punto del juego es Ultimate Team.En la version anterior usaba Ultimate Team TODOS los d&iacute;as, jugaba online TODOS los dias y hasta en el trabajo estaba detras de que item habia vendido o cual habia ganado... asi que era una adiccion total... hasta que salio el Fifa 2012. Cambiaron el dise&ntilde;o de la web a uno que a mi como dise&ntilde;ador no me lleva mas de 5 hrs de trabajo, minimizaron el tama&ntilde;o de las cartas, la resolucion en la calidad de las imagenes de los jugadores y lo que es peor: LA INDUMENTARIA ES MAS CHICA Y DIBUJADA! Ahora ya no se le ven los detalles como antes, de logos, costuras, publicidades, detalles de cada indumentaria en si...Es por todo esto que yo NO RECOMIENDO en lo mas minimo la compra de Fifa 2012 y espero que la version 2013 la mejoren porque sino me pasar&eacute; directamene a otra entrega como PES.Exitos.
Compr&eacute; este juego basado en comentarios y en un poco de nostalgia por otros juegos de boxeo, sin embargo, esperaba m&aacute;s'. ahora lo tengo guardado esperando que alguien me lo pida prestado pra no verlo mas...
The Medal of Honor games have always been great.  Until now.  This game should be a free download for anyone who still has Frontline.  It is short and the AI, as far as I can tell, is actually worse than in the previous game.  The &quot;Pacific Battlefield&quot; looks like a sandwich made out of doo-doo brown and mud.  Real pretty it is.  I couldn't tell much difference in the scenery from being down in a Phillipine sewer and running free on the beachhead (sp?)  The gameplay is a little tedious, as well.Maybe it is a good rental...This is worth about $10 +/-.If you pay $50 for this then I have a broken 32x for the Sega Genesis with no cables for just $200.  That's cash only, and this is a one-time offer.  Send all payments to:Raoul Drake515 Pensacola Hooker Ave.Shattaboulasuchi, LA 99999999-9999.Stay sober!

This game is an over glorfication of how stupid Need For Speed has gotten. How much more punishment and abuse can this great classic take? Looks like Electronic Arts and its Executives thought it would be nice to suck its customers dry out of money. Damn Spongey Execs. I thought the NFS series couldn't get worse after the first Underground....I guess the dumbas*es at Electronic Arts proved me wrong. Its a pathetic excuse for a game. Hasn't anyone else found the connection yet. Hmm lets see when NFSU came out their was a familiar movie (Hint:Fast and the Furious). Ok so they copied the movie I can't blame them its hard to gain material for a game with a long history...But NFSU2 was a big dissapointment. The overall originality of the game was non-existent. Familiar enough the time NFSU2 came out so did "Too Fast Too Furious!" Wow... Thats really ironic. The game is full of advertisments which literally drive you away from the original concept of the game. As the huge NFS fan I was this just pushed me more towards Gran Turismo. Even Nitendo racing games like Formula One beat out this game on originality and gameplay. Playing this game is like playing a big advertisment...Not really my way of having fun. So if you want to join the rest of a**holes who enjoy playing a game with cheap graphics, shi**y music,no gameplay, and non-existent originality then by all means go ahead. If I were in your place I would stick with Formula One...It has a point.

With the high-tech techno/rock/acid music pervading all the levels, the odd controls including the somewhat mandatory option to wield all weapons one-handedly (except assault rifles and rocket launchers) allowing for two weapons to be wielded at once, and the much harsher technological grittiness of the whole thing (insanely high tech items, weird futuristic weapons, cloned enemies that range from looking like SWAT team members to the Vin Diesel character Riddick), this does not feel like a Bond game.I think, if it weren't for the slightly familiar "acidic" version of the Bond theme on the main menu, and the presence of Bond villains like Auric Goldfinger, Dr. No, Pussy Galore, Francisco Scaramanga, Oddjob, Xenia Onatopp and others, this wouldn't be a Bond game at all, but "Random Action Shoot-em-up 2004"The "E.V.I.L. AI" I either must not have seen yet (I'm not completely through the campaign) or is so unremarkable as to be not there.  It apparently consists of individual enemies shooting at you, then trying to run up to you to bash you over the head with their weapons if you aren't fast enough to shoot them.  Since almost all of them wear high tech body armor, it takes quite a few shots from even a rapid-fire machine gun (resembling "Goldeneye 64's RCP-90") to take them down.  There's no blood, no permanent bodies, and no realistic methods of death.  Slain enemies take a second or two to keel over, in the same two or three motions of falling forward as if drunk, or keeling backwards.It's absolutely astonishing that MI-6 would reject this guy (as seen in a cutscene) considering how much of an expert with guns this guy must be.  He's able to wield two separate guns, no matter how big, reload them without dropping either gun for any reason, and can absorb unbelievable amounts of damage (on Normal mode!) and can even regenerate health and armor!  In fact, the only reason I can see that he's been kicked out is because he let MI-6's golden boy James Bond die in a simulation where really there was nothing he could do---Bond was hanging off a ledge several feet away, and by the time Goldeneye reaches him, he falls to his death.One thing about the game that is fantastic is the cutscenes.  The 3D modeling is smooth and beautiful without being too gritty "warts and all" like Shrek, which would probably make this game 4 or 5 discs instead of 2.  The story is actually a good one, which has Goldeneye working for Auric Goldfinger, starting off in a war with Dr. No, and actually making Goldfinger look not like a maniacal enemy seeking the world's destruction, but rather like a crime boss with his priorities in order.  Scaramanga makes an appearance as the inventor of Goldeneye's eye implant (hence his name) which allows some mildly helpful, but ultimately unimportant technologies you really wouldn't need except for one or two instances in some missions.All in all, aside from the cutscenes, story, and main theme music, you would never be able to tell this is a Bond game.  There's none of that flair, style, or mood pervasive in all other Bond games.  Even though you're playing a bad guy, you and your enemies seem of such high caliber, class, and technique, that it makes the franchise seem more like something out of a ridiculously complex spy movie.

Yes cause he's f**king you over rather ya like it or not. The controlls are not very good but you know this is a bad game when your storyline is I stumbled upon a Dojo an old man says fight for me this was made when Shaq was with the Magic so the old man says you are the magic 1 so you fight a cat huminoid a boogger Sheets a dude from Aku Locka Polkistan a chick who uses voodoo guess what her name is Voodoo Beast and the boss Sett Ra a boss so stupid he would even be passable for a Killer Instinct character. M Bison and Shao Khan were better Bosses cheap but beatable and your attacks are difficult to pull off but everybody attacks you and there specials are more powerful this would have been a decent arcade game but but play it for 2 player mode and the bad 1 liners at the end of everty fight. Good game if you need a good laugh.

Goldeneye Rogue Agent one heck of a bump in the road...Goldeneye Rogue Angent starts off in Fort Knox in a training virtual reality and from there you wish you didn't waste your money...Goldeneye Rogue Agent is an extreamly fustrating game, hundreds of people looking to make you kick-the-bucket (to die) You as some rogue agent is sent to complete some objectives that have nothing to do with the story line. But that of course is because there barly is a story line within this game. youpretty much just shoot, shoot, and shoot some more. And most of the time I'd be okay with that but this game throws there 007 feel right out the window. it put's you in a futureistic age and put you in verry unbelievable levels.You get an arrange of weapons, some are awesome, but have to actually warm up before you fire em' or you get a pistol that dosn't do heck of alot.This game rank's verry low in my 007 list's of likes. It was a waste of money and most of all a waste of inginuity from the makers of 007 video games. It makes a farce out of a good 007 game...JRF01...

It was a waste of money and most of all a waste of inginuity from the makers of 007 video games. It makes a farce out of a good 007 game...JRF01...
This game is regularly voted as one of the worst video games of all time (if not THE worst), and I won't argue with that, but I think that the game is actually strangely fascinating. It's so bad it's actually comical! In fact, it's even almost like it was intended to be that way (although I'm sure it wasn't). The game has a storyline that makes minus zero sense. The way it starts is, Shaq is in Japan before a charity basketball game, and he comes to this karate dojo (by the way, there is a bit of prominent Pepsi product placement [how's that for alliteration?] here), where an old man informs him that he (Shaq, that is) is the Magic One, and that he (again, Shaq) must go into another dimension to rescue some kid named Nezu. Then Shaq goes through this portal into the other dimension. The story begs multitudinous questions, and never answers a single one (unless I've missed or forgotten something, or more than one thing). Some examples: Just why is Shaq (the "Magic One") the ONLY one who can rescue Nezu? Why can't anyone else do it? Why was Nezu kidnapped in the first place? Why is there a portal to the other dimension inside the dojo? How does the old man know that Shaq is the Magic One (that is, the one who must rescue Nezu)? This next question doesn't really have so much to do with the story, but just exactly how do you pronounce "Nezu"? ("NEZ-oo"? "NEE-zoo"? "NAY-zoo"?) If I tried to list all of the questions that the storyline (and other things in the game) make me ask, the list would probably go on for miles before I finished it! As for the actual "game" part, I really don't think that it looks or sounds that bad (although MANY other games, including other SNES games, have done MUCH better). I wouldn't say that the controls are that good, though. Your opponents are really bizarre --- a catlady, a mummy (who is the main bad guy), and assorted other weirdos. Before each match, you and your opponent engage in a bit of smack talking --- bad smack talking, at that. It seems that your opponents all have much better moves than you do; they can whip your butt in no time. I find it odd that Shaq has no basketball-related moves; shouldn't he at least have the ability to throw basketballs at his opponents? (By the way, get a load of the mummy guy's name: Sett Ra. Those who are familiar with ancient Egyptian deities, or at least their names, will probably get a laugh out of that.) And, for those of you who may not want the ending of the game spoiled, SKIP THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH!The game ends as ridiculously as it begins (almost). Shaq returns to Earth (with Nezu) in time for that charity basketball game --- and who is there at the game but Shaq's enemies from the other dimension (or at least a couple of them, anyway). Then Shaq dishes out a little more smack talk, and that's it.Overall, a supremely cheesy game. It really makes no sense that Shaq is even on the game. The game indeed appears to have been mainly just a cheap attempt to cash in on Shaq's (then-)celebrity, as he was very big at the time; making a truly good game (let alone one where Shaq's presence actually makes sense) doesn't seem to have been a priority. If you like games with storylines that make actual sense (any sense at all), this definitely isn't one of those games. If you like games that play really well, this isn't one of those games, either. But if you just want a game that is good for a few laughs (even if that was unintentional), this game might work for you, though it certainly isn't worth paying much for.

In the long history of PC games there haven't been many James Bond-brand releases on the PC; in fact, I can't name any offhand (aside from maybe James Bond Jr.). The brand has had a fruitful experience for the consoles, including the famous release of Goldeneye for the Nintendo 64.With the release of a new Bond adventure in 2002 publisher Electronic Arts wanted to create a big cross-platform Bond action/shooter that didn't have to rely on the new movie but still carried the name and was released at about the same time. Unfortunately they decided to bet on relatively old technology and some strange creative choices to do it (at least on the PC version), and the result became a rather uninteresting game called Nightfire.The player assumes the role of dashing MI-6 agent James Bond, 007, here to free the world from nuclear tyranny, British ex-patriots, and so on. Each of the nine missions precedes a full-motion animated cut scene that uncovers more of the general plot and details the next mission. More average-quality cut scenes are interspersed throughout the game at various points.Nightfire is a first-person shooter and shares all the nuances of that breed of game, with the same familiar style of control schema, albeit with some trademark differences. Aside from the variety of guns available, Bond can switch to a gadget inventory and select from one of those - the gadgets are primarily one-event-type items. A wristwatch serves as a laser for cutting locks, for instance, though you couldn't even use it to get the attention of a guard.The other gadget worth noting is the sunglasses, which when put on can switch between different shades of the spectrum - handy for locating hidden areas, laser traps, or through women's dresses. The downside is that you can only use it for so long as it runs on (rechargeable) battery power, not to mention the sunglasses are buggy.As stated above, there are only nine missions -- each have a variety of submissions with their own set of objectives. While the level design is adequate it pretty much pushes the limits of the engine, including multiple loads in a single level. The objectives, which update as the mission progresses, is not very helpful at telling you what needs to be done or even why. Only by going through a level, killing everything, and checking and/or destroying everything else can you really figure some of them out - unless of course it happens to be a level where there is a never-ending stream of bad guys and there is no clue as to what to do.Another problem of note is that a player can effectively win a mission by accomplishing an objective, get killed because of something else, and still lose the mission as the mission results screen is delayed while the game still runs. I actually ran into this on a particularly annoying boss level.Mere mention of the console game-style boss creatures is another bad mark. This by itself is not too annoying, but the bosses, not to mention the situations you're thrust into, are painfully stupid. Speaking of painfully stupid, that would be the perfect description of the game's artificial intelligence (AI) - enough said on that.This is not to say that Nightfire has some redeeming qualities. Some of the levels require going into third-person mode, which is a fun switch. Bond can only carry around four big weapons at a time, so you will have to strategize in some situations. You can use multiple different methods in certain missions to accomplish the objective. On the very first mission, Bond can sneak his way into the castle complex through the back way or fight his way through.Nightfire includes a multiplayer mode as well. It consists of LAN or internet play, supporting up to 32 players, with three modes of play: combat training (deathmatch), team combat training (team deathmatch), and capture the flag. In team games one team assumes the role of the good guys while the other team is the bad guys - and they have different models to match. Unfortunately, multiplayer mode seems tacked on and a few of the levels are very unbalanced.Several times already I've described the Nightfire engine as being stretched to the limit. That's because the developer, Gearbox Interactive, went with the Half-Life engine to develop the game, and added in their own in-house goodies. Gearbox is no stranger to using the Half-Life engine, but to release a major title with a four year-old engine (at launch) is troublesome at best.Character models are average if not great, and the animations are about the same - though there are some specialized animations as well. The Australian secret agent is a blond Lara Croft rip-off.I'm a bit of a Bond movie traditionalist so it's hurtful to sit through a particularly hard level of Nightfire listening to some techno/new age version of a rehashed Bond theme over and over again. Oh, there is some variety, and a small bit of it is catchy, but enough is enough. The song featured in the intro sequence by the female singer Esthero (and plays in the background on the menu screens) is quite good, however. The voice acting for the various characters, including Bond, seems very uneven.James Bond 007: Nightfire is a lackluster game stuck in an old engine that probably should have gone through a bit more in the design and implementation stage. Aside from a nice opening sequence and a few "well that's kind of cool" moments in-game Nightfire should definitely have its license revoked.

Review update  1/23/13So I had the Two Towers game for Gamecube back when it first came out in 2002 and I loved it, and played the ass out of it.  But by the time this one came out, I had either lost interest or couldn't be bothered to spend money on buying it.Where the previous game was smooth, streamlined, and somewhat tempered in its hacking n slashing so that hacking and slashing half a dozen opponents was overwhelming yet rewarding in a way that some hack n slashes do with half a hundred opponents in the same time.  It had the original voice actors playing themselves, even unlockable interviews with them talking about it and their recording.  It even had incentives to replay levels using each character over again.Nine years later, I returned to the games, and played this one.Everything about the previous game that was good seems to be completely and thoroughly wasted or rendered useless in this game.The graphics are somewhat improved for the characters, but the drab color scheme (a questionable decision given that this game covers more areas and different characters) and stunningly awful enemy designs mean that while you could easily discern Orcs from Goblins from Uruk-Hai, including the big orcs who were like Uruk-Hai, and the incredibly annoying Uruk-Hai with no shirt who would always knock you down with his one-handed sword, in this game you can almost never tell the difference (if there even is any) between the various types of Orc.Adding to the monotony of the color is perhaps the most mind-numbingly awful methods of ramping up gameplay difficulty from the previous game.  Virtually every bad game design decision that could be implemented here was implemented;- The camera positioning is hideous and you frequently end up being unable to see your own character for long periods of time, or running headlong against the side of the screen, only to be suddenly attacked at the last moment by a horde of enemies you were apparently charging straight into blindly.Some specific examples include the wall battle of Minas Tirith, a pretty blatant copy of the wall battle of Helms Deep from the previous game, only this time with you as Gandalf and with constant annoying little secondary objectives that give the enemy far too much time to swarm the wall, such as rushing to catapults to fire on enemy siege towers, despite them ALREADY HAVING TEAMS OF MEN AT THE CATAPULTS FULLY CAPABLE OF PULLING THE SWITCH TO FIRE.  The camera angling is so terrible that you can never actually see the staircase you're supposed to walk up to find the catapults.  The game never even hints how you get to them, and it was literally only dumb luck that I found the camera shifted when I reached a certain blind spot, showing me these stairs.Another horrendous example comes when Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli arrive on Pelennor Fields, and must go through a gauntlet of taking out Oliphaunts one at a time.  Aside from the afore-mentioned face-palming stupidity exercise that this is, the game constantly goes to cut scene to show you the arrival of each and every single new Oliphaunt, as well as the Witch-King arriving, thus leaving your character frozen in place while random Uruks and Eastern Men swarm your position; if you had virtually no health (and you almost certainly will) you pretty much instantly die as soon as the cutscene is done.  And the way the cutscene is shot makes it difficult to tell which side of a massive canyon you should be on in order to shoot at the Oliphaunt.- Ridiculous difficulty levels involving health and damage.  At the very least for this game, you can purchase combo and weapon upgrades that apply to ALL characters rather than you own, with a discount to offer incentive toward this while having a need to keep upping your best characters to meet future challenges.  Despite this, difficulty isn't raised by having smarter opponents or tougher battles, but simply by lowering your health drastically and lowering your weapon damage drastically, then by doubling the amount of enemies thrown at you.Whereas the previous game's health bar was well balanced with its green for good, yellow for mildly damaged, orange for seriously damaged, and red for near-death, and a good player almost always managing to keep yellow or better, no amount of skill will keep players from spending more than half the time in red health, bordering on dying.  This wouldn't be so frustrating if not for the fact that the game seemingly doesn't expect this, and thus has the health bar constantly FLASHING at the bottom of the screen when you're in red.This is exacerbated by incredibly bad combos.  Despite using some of the same button sequences as the previous game, combos here are poorly executed, with some of the most important ones being so slow in execution that they only work against an opponent one on one; if there is a second opponent, he need only shove you roughly to completely break the combo and send you staggering back.  This means combos are as likely to fail as they are to work properly, and even worse, don't do enough damage to kill most of the time; when there's few, if any combos that allow for sweeping attacks or splash damage, knocking one opponent down for a second before moving on to another is just as much a waste of time as simply mashing A repeatedly, with the exact same results achieved.At the very least, you can block attacks with your attack instead of having to press B constantly (though this works best).  And even worse is being knocked down; unlike the previous game, when you're knocked down by ANYTHING (be it a gargantuan Orc champion, a troll, or a dog-sized spider) you stay down for 3 full seconds, unmoving, and take another 2-3 seconds just getting up.  In the midst of fast-hack-n-slash gameplay, particularly in the Pelennor Fields where 6 seconds is long enough to miss your chance to kill the Oliphaunt and spook the Witch King away from Merry and Eowyn, this is deadly, not to mention a colossal waste of time with regards to action.  I cannot even imagine how this decision to make rising such a sluggish action was considered and implemented unless there's a future upgrade to speed up rising time (though about 50% of the way into the game, it's not anywhere to be seen).- Long-winded missions with multiple sub-objectives and poorly spaced out checkpoints.This section alone topples the entire game, in my opinion.  It is absolutely gamebreaking and the true definition of "an exercise in face-palming stupidity"The Two Towers' missions were typically lengthy, with frequent checkpoints and clear-cut objectives, like "Kill 40 Uruk-Hai, run this way to protect Frodo, kill 10 Uruk-Hai, kill Uruk boss", it was mostly about rushing through maze-like levels, killing, doing stuff, killing, and boss fights.Here, they implement so many sections that in some cases bring the gameplay to a screeching halt so you can try and fail over and over to figure out their completely pointless little puzzle section, or try and fail over and over as they throw complicated objectives on top of being swarmed by hundreds of opponents.Some of the absolute worst examples include:Samwise in Shelob's lair.  There are little sections that serve absolutely no purpose except to waste time, in which Sam has to pick up a conveniently placed torch and throw it in the middle of a pile of little spiders in order to clear them from his path.  Rather than just using it once or twice to teach us to use the Z button for interactions, they implement it as a primary level feature, and there's literally one section where you have to do it three times in a row to reach a locked door, only to realize YOU HAVE TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN GOING BACK WHERE YOU STARTED in order to climb up past ANOTHER series of spiders and torches.The Big Three in the Ghost lair.  More than once, you're forced to button-mash the Z button to turn a wheel that lowers a bridge while ghostly archers shoot at you, balancing between deflecting their arrows and working on the bridge.  Not only is this so easy that you could just stand there as half the arrows simply glitch past you due to piss-poor collision detection, but sometimes a cutscene showing the bridge lowering wastes several seconds.Other times, the game simply demands ridiculously over the top objectives and gives you literally nothing to work with.  In these circumstances, even lowering the difficulty does nothing to change the impenetrable grind in some of these levels.  The design is not one of any sort of challenge or skill or talent, but literally face-palming stupidity and repetition until you finally overcome the odds by sheer statistics.  It's the very action of the saying "the definition of insanity is doing the exact same thing over and over and expecting different results".  And unlike the previous game, your allies are completely and utterly useless; they will never ever successfully kill more than one enemy in the time you've taken out five or six or more and moved on.  Sometimes they won't even attack, but just stand still in front of an enemy until that enemy decides to ignore them and attack you.Some of the worst offenders include the aforementioned level in the Ghost cave, where you inexplicably have to fight some ghosts.  Random rocks will burst out of the ground, blocking your progress until you defeat a bunch of ghosts somehow.  As well, if you get too close to the ghosts, they can pretty much insta-kill you, sending you right the hell back to the start of the level or the start of the checkpoint.  There's literally nothing you can do to avoid this but try again and do the exact same thing over again.Similarly, the aforementioned Pelennor Fields gauntlet of "I have to do everything because everyone else is too effing stupid" tasks, in which to start, you have to kill 60 east men, but not Orcs.  I specifically say not Orcs, because they don't count towards the 60, and because there's as many of them on the field as there are east men.  Why east men only instead of Orcs, no effing idea why, since the overall objective means you could be fighting wild deer or gremlins or inanimate objects and the result as well as the task would be exactly the same; killing these 60 eastermen doesn't matter at all; the respawn infinitesimally and after you finish this pointless objective, you move on to the real mission.And this "warm up" isn't even vital to the actual mission; you could literally just run past the field and set up camp on the cliffs overlooking the canyon where the Oliphaunts spawn, but the combination of pointless objective and incredibly awful camera angling means you're literally lost in the fray and have no idea where to even go once you've finished the objective.And the sheer number of Orcs and East Men spawned and thrown at you in this phase makes it so difficult that it should be in some way relevant; I've died and had to restart so often in this spot, I could have finished entire levels of this same long-winded game in the amount of time I spent dealing with flimsy combos which left me wide open to attack by the 50,000 other enemies surrounding me, being knocked over long enough for another 50,000 to trample me, and spending so much time with red blinking health on the brink of death while mashing B to block 50,000 blades all attacking me that I could reach Perfect Mode two times over just from the blocks, and have no avenue open to even attack anyone!  ALL of those events (aside from the obvious number exaggeration) happened to me in this one effing level!!!And the punchline is; this isn't the first time you're put in such a situation.  An earlier level has the exact same setup; you randomly thrown into a random spot of battlefield with endless swarms of Orcs spawning on you, and half an hour spent blocking and killing them by the score, with no end in sight, and no mission objective in sight.  Unlike the Pelennor Fields one where you at least saw it would end after killing 60 East Men, this level (forgot which) had NO such objective, and NO clue or insight into what you were supposed to be doing!IF you survived long enough, the mission would end up failing anyway because apparently you were supposed to go and rescue someone while fighting through the Orcs.  This WOULD have made sense if the Orcs were actually IN BETWEEN YOU AND THE THING YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO REACH.  Instead, they're literally on the EXACT OPPOSITE SIDE, so the way to complete this objective is not to fight your way through the Orcs, but to COMPLETELY IGNORE THEM AND RUN AWAY.  And you only learn this AFTER being killed half a dozen times or having the mission abruptly fail with absolutely no explanation as to why.Back to the Pelennor Fields level, another layer of insanity/stupidity comes with the Witch King; he randomly appears to fly over Eowyn and Merry and apparently do nothing.  They take damage, but the Witch King neither attacks them nor shoots arrows or spears or magic at them.  You're supposed to shoot arrows at him to make him fly away.  Not only does this occur while the Oliphaunts still come (and taking them down is a tedium all in itself) but if the Oliphaunts make it to Eowyn and Merry, you instantly fail the mission, and the amount of time it takes to move from different locations and fire off arrows means that there are some cases where it is genuinely not possible to win the mission, because you missed out by a second or less getting up after being knocked down, and either the Witch King or an Oliphaunt kills Merry and Eowyn.And making it even more catastrophically infuriating is that Orcs and East Men KEEP SPAWNING THIS WHOLE TIME and they KEEP rushing at you to attack you!  So sometimes you don't even need to be just a bit too slow; you could be distracted by them rushing you, wasting your time, while the Oliphaunt trudges closer, or the Witch King kills off Eowyn and Merry.And this literally happens to me every time: When I try to target the Witch King to shoot arrows at him, ONE enemy soldier spots me and rushes at me... and my bow's targetting targets HIM instead of the Witch King, and thus far I've found absolutely nothing short of completely putting the bow away and killing him that will serve to take the bow's aim OFF the goddamn bat and ON the goddamn Witch King.At this rate, it seems impossible for the game to present anything that could lift it out of this mad mess of pointless wall-banging repetition and stupidity.  It's become for me the go-to guide on how not to make an action game.  Despite the playable gameplay elements for hacking and slashing, unless you want to move past stage 1, you're SOL.

It even had incentives to replay levels using each character over again.Nine years later, I returned to the games, and played this one.Everything about the previous game that was good seems to be completely and thoroughly wasted or rendered useless in this game.The graphics are somewhat improved for the characters, but the drab color scheme (a questionable decision given that this game covers more areas and different characters) and stunningly awful enemy designs mean that while you could easily discern Orcs from Goblins from Uruk-Hai, including the big orcs who were like Uruk-Hai, and the incredibly annoying Uruk-Hai with no shirt who would always knock you down with his one-handed sword, in this game you can almost never tell the difference (if there even is any) between the various types of Orc.Adding to the monotony of the color is perhaps the most mind-numbingly awful methods of ramping up gameplay difficulty from the previous game.  Virtually every bad game design decision that could be implemented here was implemented;- The camera positioning is hideous and you frequently end up being unable to see your own character for long periods of time, or running headlong against the side of the screen, only to be suddenly attacked at the last moment by a horde of enemies you were apparently charging straight into blindly.Some specific examples include the wall battle of Minas Tirith, a pretty blatant copy of the wall battle of Helms Deep from the previous game, only this time with you as Gandalf and with constant annoying little secondary objectives that give the enemy far too much time to swarm the wall, such as rushing to catapults to fire on enemy siege towers, despite them ALREADY HAVING TEAMS OF MEN AT THE CATAPULTS FULLY CAPABLE OF PULLING THE SWITCH TO FIRE.  The camera angling is so terrible that you can never actually see the staircase you're supposed to walk up to find the catapults.  The game never even hints how you get to them, and it was literally only dumb luck that I found the camera shifted when I reached a certain blind spot, showing me these stairs.Another horrendous example comes when Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli arrive on Pelennor Fields, and must go through a gauntlet of taking out Oliphaunts one at a time.  Aside from the afore-mentioned face-palming stupidity exercise that this is, the game constantly goes to cut scene to show you the arrival of each and every single new Oliphaunt, as well as the Witch-King arriving, thus leaving your character frozen in place while random Uruks and Eastern Men swarm your position; if you had virtually no health (and you almost certainly will) you pretty much instantly die as soon as the cutscene is done.  And the way the cutscene is shot makes it difficult to tell which side of a massive canyon you should be on in order to shoot at the Oliphaunt.- Ridiculous difficulty levels involving health and damage.  At the very least for this game, you can purchase combo and weapon upgrades that apply to ALL characters rather than you own, with a discount to offer incentive toward this while having a need to keep upping your best characters to meet future challenges.  Despite this, difficulty isn't raised by having smarter opponents or tougher battles, but simply by lowering your health drastically and lowering your weapon damage drastically, then by doubling the amount of enemies thrown at you.Whereas the previous game's health bar was well balanced with its green for good, yellow for mildly damaged, orange for seriously damaged, and red for near-death, and a good player almost always managing to keep yellow or better, no amount of skill will keep players from spending more than half the time in red health, bordering on dying.  This wouldn't be so frustrating if not for the fact that the game seemingly doesn't expect this, and thus has the health bar constantly FLASHING at the bottom of the screen when you're in red.This is exacerbated by incredibly bad combos.  Despite using some of the same button sequences as the previous game, combos here are poorly executed, with some of the most important ones being so slow in execution that they only work against an opponent one on one; if there is a second opponent, he need only shove you roughly to completely break the combo and send you staggering back.  This means combos are as likely to fail as they are to work properly, and even worse, don't do enough damage to kill most of the time; when there's few, if any combos that allow for sweeping attacks or splash damage, knocking one opponent down for a second before moving on to another is just as much a waste of time as simply mashing A repeatedly, with the exact same results achieved.At the very least, you can block attacks with your attack instead of having to press B constantly (though this works best).  And even worse is being knocked down; unlike the previous game, when you're knocked down by ANYTHING (be it a gargantuan Orc champion, a troll, or a dog-sized spider) you stay down for 3 full seconds, unmoving, and take another 2-3 seconds just getting up.  In the midst of fast-hack-n-slash gameplay, particularly in the Pelennor Fields where 6 seconds is long enough to miss your chance to kill the Oliphaunt and spook the Witch King away from Merry and Eowyn, this is deadly, not to mention a colossal waste of time with regards to action.  I cannot even imagine how this decision to make rising such a sluggish action was considered and implemented unless there's a future upgrade to speed up rising time (though about 50% of the way into the game, it's not anywhere to be seen).- Long-winded missions with multiple sub-objectives and poorly spaced out checkpoints.This section alone topples the entire game, in my opinion.  It is absolutely gamebreaking and the true definition of "an exercise in face-palming stupidity"The Two Towers' missions were typically lengthy, with frequent checkpoints and clear-cut objectives, like "Kill 40 Uruk-Hai, run this way to protect Frodo, kill 10 Uruk-Hai, kill Uruk boss", it was mostly about rushing through maze-like levels, killing, doing stuff, killing, and boss fights.Here, they implement so many sections that in some cases bring the gameplay to a screeching halt so you can try and fail over and over to figure out their completely pointless little puzzle section, or try and fail over and over as they throw complicated objectives on top of being swarmed by hundreds of opponents.Some of the absolute worst examples include:Samwise in Shelob's lair.  There are little sections that serve absolutely no purpose except to waste time, in which Sam has to pick up a conveniently placed torch and throw it in the middle of a pile of little spiders in order to clear them from his path.  Rather than just using it once or twice to teach us to use the Z button for interactions, they implement it as a primary level feature, and there's literally one section where you have to do it three times in a row to reach a locked door, only to realize YOU HAVE TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN GOING BACK WHERE YOU STARTED in order to climb up past ANOTHER series of spiders and torches.The Big Three in the Ghost lair.  More than once, you're forced to button-mash the Z button to turn a wheel that lowers a bridge while ghostly archers shoot at you, balancing between deflecting their arrows and working on the bridge.  Not only is this so easy that you could just stand there as half the arrows simply glitch past you due to piss-poor collision detection, but sometimes a cutscene showing the bridge lowering wastes several seconds.Other times, the game simply demands ridiculously over the top objectives and gives you literally nothing to work with.  In these circumstances, even lowering the difficulty does nothing to change the impenetrable grind in some of these levels.  The design is not one of any sort of challenge or skill or talent, but literally face-palming stupidity and repetition until you finally overcome the odds by sheer statistics.  It's the very action of the saying "the definition of insanity is doing the exact same thing over and over and expecting different results".  And unlike the previous game, your allies are completely and utterly useless; they will never ever successfully kill more than one enemy in the time you've taken out five or six or more and moved on.  Sometimes they won't even attack, but just stand still in front of an enemy until that enemy decides to ignore them and attack you.Some of the worst offenders include the aforementioned level in the Ghost cave, where you inexplicably have to fight some ghosts.  Random rocks will burst out of the ground, blocking your progress until you defeat a bunch of ghosts somehow.  As well, if you get too close to the ghosts, they can pretty much insta-kill you, sending you right the hell back to the start of the level or the start of the checkpoint.  There's literally nothing you can do to avoid this but try again and do the exact same thing over again.Similarly, the aforementioned Pelennor Fields gauntlet of "I have to do everything because everyone else is too effing stupid" tasks, in which to start, you have to kill 60 east men, but not Orcs.  I specifically say not Orcs, because they don't count towards the 60, and because there's as many of them on the field as there are east men.  Why east men only instead of Orcs, no effing idea why, since the overall objective means you could be fighting wild deer or gremlins or inanimate objects and the result as well as the task would be exactly the same; killing these 60 eastermen doesn't matter at all; the respawn infinitesimally and after you finish this pointless objective, you move on to the real mission.And this "warm up" isn't even vital to the actual mission; you could literally just run past the field and set up camp on the cliffs overlooking the canyon where the Oliphaunts spawn, but the combination of pointless objective and incredibly awful camera angling means you're literally lost in the fray and have no idea where to even go once you've finished the objective.And the sheer number of Orcs and East Men spawned and thrown at you in this phase makes it so difficult that it should be in some way relevant; I've died and had to restart so often in this spot, I could have finished entire levels of this same long-winded game in the amount of time I spent dealing with flimsy combos which left me wide open to attack by the 50,000 other enemies surrounding me, being knocked over long enough for another 50,000 to trample me, and spending so much time with red blinking health on the brink of death while mashing B to block 50,000 blades all attacking me that I could reach Perfect Mode two times over just from the blocks, and have no avenue open to even attack anyone!  ALL of those events (aside from the obvious number exaggeration) happened to me in this one effing level!!!And the punchline is; this isn't the first time you're put in such a situation.  An earlier level has the exact same setup; you randomly thrown into a random spot of battlefield with endless swarms of Orcs spawning on you, and half an hour spent blocking and killing them by the score, with no end in sight, and no mission objective in sight.  Unlike the Pelennor Fields one where you at least saw it would end after killing 60 East Men, this level (forgot which) had NO such objective, and NO clue or insight into what you were supposed to be doing!IF you survived long enough, the mission would end up failing anyway because apparently you were supposed to go and rescue someone while fighting through the Orcs.  This WOULD have made sense if the Orcs were actually IN BETWEEN YOU AND THE THING YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO REACH.  Instead, they're literally on the EXACT OPPOSITE SIDE, so the way to complete this objective is not to fight your way through the Orcs, but to COMPLETELY IGNORE THEM AND RUN AWAY.  And you only learn this AFTER being killed half a dozen times or having the mission abruptly fail with absolutely no explanation as to why.Back to the Pelennor Fields level, another layer of insanity/stupidity comes with the Witch King; he randomly appears to fly over Eowyn and Merry and apparently do nothing.  They take damage, but the Witch King neither attacks them nor shoots arrows or spears or magic at them.  You're supposed to shoot arrows at him to make him fly away.  Not only does this occur while the Oliphaunts still come (and taking them down is a tedium all in itself) but if the Oliphaunts make it to Eowyn and Merry, you instantly fail the mission, and the amount of time it takes to move from different locations and fire off arrows means that there are some cases where it is genuinely not possible to win the mission, because you missed out by a second or less getting up after being knocked down, and either the Witch King or an Oliphaunt kills Merry and Eowyn.And making it even more catastrophically infuriating is that Orcs and East Men KEEP SPAWNING THIS WHOLE TIME and they KEEP rushing at you to attack you!  So sometimes you don't even need to be just a bit too slow; you could be distracted by them rushing you, wasting your time, while the Oliphaunt trudges closer, or the Witch King kills off Eowyn and Merry.And this literally happens to me every time: When I try to target the Witch King to shoot arrows at him, ONE enemy soldier spots me and rushes at me... and my bow's targetting targets HIM instead of the Witch King, and thus far I've found absolutely nothing short of completely putting the bow away and killing him that will serve to take the bow's aim OFF the goddamn bat and ON the goddamn Witch King.At this rate, it seems impossible for the game to present anything that could lift it out of this mad mess of pointless wall-banging repetition and stupidity.  It's become for me the go-to guide on how not to make an action game.  Despite the playable gameplay elements for hacking and slashing, unless you want to move past stage 1, you're SOL.
You know, pirates are all about sailing the seven seas, scourging and plundering mercilessly to retrieve your loot and stab your trusted officers in the back when orders are not fufilled. But Pirates: The Legened of Black Kat is anything but what you thought a pirate game should be.First off, the only real highlight of this game is being the captian of many ships and buying repair and weapon items. But even sailing them and doing sea battles is not that challenging and not that fun.You can also dock on many islands and many worlds as Katrina de' Leon, but even that is exceptionly bad. She does not have many moves or abilityes and heck, she can't even climb up the smallest hills!Graphics on this game are very poor, and all of the villians and chest items you retrive look horrible. The only good graphics of the game are the waters of the oceans you sail which look very real.The music is alright...when it decides to turn itself on. One of this games' many flaws is that it gives you no motivation to keep "adventuring" while you play and you don't feel like you ever want to plug it in after your done playing!However, there are little aspects of this game that seem interesting but not enough to keep you from being bored, such as Tiki Heads which give you different attacks, and magical figureheads on your ship to give it powers out of the ordinary. Yet even these items do very little to keep you wanting to play.Mostly, I kept wanting to see more variety of gameplay and challenges, as it quickly got repetitive, and the puzzles on this game are quick to solve.All in all, if you like horrible, poorly desighned laking gameplay in a video game, I sugest that you don't even glance at this game next time you come across it.It just plain is'nt worth it.

Dante's Inferno is a loose adaptation of the first part of the epic Italian poem The Divine Comedy. In this re-imagining of Dante Alighieri's descent into Hell, Dante is no poet. Instead, Dante is a warrior and a damned soul. After joining the crusades under the banner of King Richard Dante finds himself doomed to Hell for his sins. Worse, his murdered love Beatrice has promised herself to the devil as a result of Dante's sins.The game starts out strong with incredible artwork that paints a disturbing picture of the realm of the damned. Dante climbs walls of damned souls, battles unbaptized infants, and rides the ferryman Charon across Styx.The battles on the way play out almost exactly like God of War, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Chaining a string of light and heavy attacks together you tear through the minions of hell in a sickenly satisfying manner. By collecting souls you can purchase upgrades for Dante's attacks and by absolving enemies of their sins or punishing them instead you can gain levels in holy or unholy which allow you to purchase even more advanced attacks and skills. Graphic cinematic kills are achieved through your standard quick-time sequences (press this button, now that button, now the other button).You can also upgrade Dante's weapons by collecting hidden relics, interact with historical and literary damned souls, and follow your guide, Virgil, as he helps Dante toward his final goal: Beatrice.The problem is that the game, while strong at the start, peters out awfully quick. By the lust level the game just becomes an exercise in frustration. Annoying jumping "puzzles" and unclear objectives, complicated by a fixed camera that often obscures key parts of the environment or focuses on irrelevant pieces of it, become the norm. Swinging from weird, fleshy ropes is fun the first time or two, but after you've fallen off the same one for the dozenth time because you can't see where you're supposed to go gets old pretty quick.Worse, puzzles later in the game serve little point beyond being artificial obstacles to slow your progress. For the most part, they involve moving an object somewhere on the screen, pulling a lever, seeing what happens and making a note of it so that after you die for your failure you can do it right the next time.Battles, particularly boss battles, function the same way. You go in, get beat to death while making notes of what to do next time, then do it. They also become particularly frustrating later in the game as it begins throwing large numbers of enemies at you and then expecting you to not only deal with them, but also quickly move to new parts of the screen to interact with levers and other objects. It's not difficult, it's just cheesy.Overall, Dante is an "okay" game. If you haven't played God of War you probably won't be too disappointed; but, since, mechanically, Dante is little more than an unapologetic God of War pretender, and a mediocre one at that, veterans of that superior series will probably just find Dante ultimately an annoying and pointless game after the first two hours or so. In that case, maybe just rent it, play through the Lust level, then hit Youtube to see the rest of the game and save yourself the trouble.
Tao Feng is a below average fighting game. It's best feature is the limb damage and nice graphics, but everything else in the game is a miss. the controls are sluggish. You'll notice a slight delay when you press the buttons to the character on screen responding to it a second later. Sound effects are weak and you can barlely hear the smacks. The novelty in this game is that when you block attack too much you can have limb damage in your arms or legs. You'll see the characters limping and do less damage when they attack. But they can repair their injuries when they do combo moves on you, which defeats the whole purpose of "limb damage". The fighting techniques are uninspired and lack that extra -oomph-. The character's animation look a bit stiff and lack fluidity which other fighting games have. In addition to the stiffness, the characters are very ugly looking. They look like platic action figures and have a bunch of tattoos on their bodies. There are only a few fighting arenas and they are mostly dark settings. There is only a few unlockables and they are not satifying. There are better fighting games outthere, save your money for those.Pros:+nice graphics+good sound effects+limb damageCons:-ugly character designs-uglier music-unresponsive controls-combos are hard to pull off-difficult to block attacks-short game-weak animation-dark looking arenas-lacks intensity-fighting techniques look generic

This game is the worst game I have played since Land of the Dead: Road To Fiddlers Green. To start, how can this game get a decent grade for controls!? Its TERRIBLE and BROKEN!!!!!!! To aim down-sight you must press the LEFT STICK!!! WTF!!? And not only that, but you have to effin hold the thing!!!!!!! And since the control sensitivity is a default ULTRA LIGHT SPEED FAST, it is IMPOSSIBLE to aim. Jumping is left trigger... yeah, wtf!? Additionally, to switch weapons you must hold the RIGHT stick in and open an inventory screen in which you freeze your character in place and leave him open to be attacked and most likely killed.... on top of THAT your guns are atrocious in aiming... you will literally, I mean L-I-T-E-R-A-L-L-Y shoot circles around the soviet soldiers. ON THE SUBJECT of Soviet soldiers... these motha flippins take SOOOOO many shots that not even the marvel super hero Hulk could survive... gotta calm down.. back to the controls. Eventually you get to lead your rebellious New York soldiers, so "Y" tells them to go to one spot (if you hold down Y then the entire team goes to the spot while just tapping it sends ones soldier), pressing "B" tells them to defend one spot, and "X" tells them to regroup.. sounds easy right? well its NOT!!! I guarentee you will find yourself pressing X to reload, but wind up calling your men back... what IS the reload button you ask? HAHAHAH! There is none, you actually reload if you don't shoot for a handful of seconds. Very awkward if there is a break in an intense fire fight yanno? Its like... *RATATATATATATATA...reload automatically while enemy is standing there shooting you*Lets talk about the AI and the bugs plauging this lackluster game. Theres a SERIOUS chopping issue within Freedom Fighters, where enemies can shoot through and run walls, appear out of thin air, or just never stop coming. Ontop of that you can stand in front of an enemy for about 5 minutes (yes I did time this) before they go "Holy **** thats an American soldier!" and shoot at you with 100% accuracy. Then comes your partner AI.... when it comes to shooting enemies they are okay, but they DO NOT LISTEN TO YOU!!!!! Numerous times have I told a soldier to stand in one spot only to see him run off and get slaughtered. OH YES I FORGOT TO MENTION: a LOT of the time, your soldiers will run towards fences that are suppose to basically be a barrier for the end of the level or a barrier to make you find another way around and actually run right through it.. I swear to Buddha.I think the story and how they pieced together the missions were probably the only good part of this title. Basically, the Russians beat the United States in building the first atom bomb, nuked Japan and forced its way into Europe seizing control of the continent. From there they moved into Cuba and then one day attacked Manhatten, NY. Moving on, each mission affects another one. For instance in one mission labeled "The Bridge" you must use TNT to blow up a bridge, but you must clear the stage, then go back to the stage "The Hotel", pick up the TNT while heading back to "The Bridge" and then use the TNT on the bridge which will help the people from the "Firehouse" stage to sweep through. I thought that was kind of cool... but thats it.A combination of horrendous controls, disgusting music, glitches, bugs, atrocious AI, and punishing difficulty make Freedom Fighters one of the worst original X-Box titles I have ever played. How in the name of Zeus did this game get a 9.3? I honestly do not see it.

I recently rented this game from GameFly.  If you're reading this review, hopefully you know that the online play is no more, which is sad.  I got this game hoping it was going to be like the Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, a game I loved playing on my Nintendo GameCube.  I enjoyed the Return of the King because it made hack and slash fun, you got multiplyers for good, excellent and perfect kills.  You often had to fight through hordes of enemies and aside from your main weapon, you had bows and arrows and stuff like that, you could also pick up spears and stuff and the game really added a variety and spice to the gameplay.In Lord of the Rings Conquest, you have four different classes to choose from: warrior, archer, mage and scout.  Each has their strengths and weaknesses.  You can also play occasionally as a hero that often falls into those various categories.  You rack up hits much like in the previous LOTR hack & slash games and you have strong, medium and light attacks and you have various objectives much like the last one, opening doors, claiming positions, protecting things, collecting things, killing baddies and always heading to the next arrow.This game looks ok.  It really disappoints actually, it's nothing special to look at.  The recreation of locations looks much like movie locations which is quite something, but the locations are EMPTY.  Battlefields looks EMPTY.  I can't believe no other review I've read has stated this.  This game is NOT EPIC, IT'S EMPTY.  I was running around like a crazy person in the Battle for Helms deep LOOKING FOR ORCS TO SLAUGHTER.  The game doesn't give the feeling of overwhelming odds and there's more enemies when you invade the Shire then at other key times like the Battle for Helms Deep or the Fields of Pelennor.You don't use too many of the various classes, you end up just using like the warrior and using the same combo/moves over and over (I realize this same argument could be made about many hack and slash games).  But it's boring as heck, and the only thing that helps make this game fun is the occasional break where you get to be some kick-butt dude like Sauramon, Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, an Ent, a Nazgal and my personal favorite, the Balrog.  These moments are shining examples in the game that stand out from the time you're that faceless/nameless grunt that will probably die a hundred times by a hundred deaths.Let's hope that the Lord of the Rings: War in the North will give us a real Lord of the Rings game that will make us proud.

Sure it was fun for the first hour then it died. I could never get the kids to stop vandalism. Riding the rollercoasters weren't fun at all. You want a theme park game get Rollercoaster tycoon. Rollercoaster tycoon not Rollercoaster tycoon 2, but I won't get into that. Where can I get a refund....?

Please listen to me and realize that this was a very dissapointing game.  What went wrong I don't know.  EA &quot;Challenged&quot; their reputation making this game, cause it freaking sucks.Pros:- Graphics (Everything is more lifelike and seems almost that you can zoom in further than the other SimCity/s)- Terrain Builder (You can build mountains, hills, or make valleys and lakes)- Airport (This airport actually brings in people to your city and is no longer a zone.  It is pre-made)Cons:- Difficulty (Certainly not for the younger crowd)- Budget (I'm having a lot of trouble keeping money... no matter what- I have like three toxic waste dumps and a naval base missile tester and still my monthly income is negative.  I've raised my taxes and lowered matinence and buses and everything- nothing works.  MAJOR FLAW!)- Zoning (The zoning puts in streets that don't line up with other streets and if you delete you wast money because it's part of the zone.)- Overrated (look at the front of this game.  Never will you see buildings like that- trust me.  I never see blimps or helicopters.)Overall- 2/10 (I like the terrain builder a lot... but that's the only thing better than SimCity3000).Final Word- I was terribly dissapointed with this game.  SimCity3000 is just so much better.  Get it, and save some $.Have Fun w/ SimCity300, cause you WILL not have much fun with this.

This game would take about about an hour to play if the controls and weapons were at all responsive. Some of the environments look pretty, put the enemy fighters are straight out of a windows 95 first person shooter.People complain about suppossed racism in the GTA series, but our group of racially mixed gamers found the asian enemies in Rising Sun to be offensive stereotypes beyond anything in Vice City. Unlike Vice City, which is violent with an obvious tongue in cheek sarcasm, this game wraps it's racial violence with themes of patriotism, making Rising Sun truly disturbing.

Ok,I'm a HUGE fan of Sim-stuff ... I can't get over how clever they are, how real they play out, how absolutely consuming they can be.This product is not one of them.It's awkward, it's punchy, and buggy. It  restricts your creativity in a way that I've yet to experience in any other  Sim game. You are limited to two island scenarios to begin, and they are in  themes like Dinosaur, and Space Ship ... and they are VERY tiny -- not much  to work with.  Creative-wise, you are stuck with rides that are typical to  that particular theme -- IE: your park attendees bounce up and down on a  dinosaur's stomache as one of the rides. *shudder*I think the game is  ideal for children 10 and under. It's fun and quirky enough to entertain  them, but it's not what you'd typically expect, as an avid adult player,  from a Sim game.Try Roller Coaster Tycoon if you're an adult fan of  simulated amusement park game software (but even that gets a bit dull after  a while -- it's easy to win and repetitive).Or try The Sims, it's quite  entertaining, and very well put together.

I LOVED Theme Park and Theme Hospital, RCT is the best Sim game around so I had high hopes that Theme Park World (as its called in the UK) would go one step further.Basically this is a kiddies game. Its NOTHING like  Theme Park and your very limited to what you can do. There are fun rides  and the best part is walking round the park and going on your rides but you  dont have the same amount of control as in RCT.Its nice to look at  (although I didn't like the 3D style) and you need a good spec machine  otherwise expect jerkovision (or if you build too many rides). Theres only  4 parks/scenarios!  unlike RCT where there are loads plus an add on pack).  My nephew liked taking pictures of the park and emailing them but it has  taken a whole new view point into Sim games. This isn't a true Sim game  -  I think we need a bit of going back to basics here and seeing what makes a  Sim game. Just look at Theme Hospital and RCT. It also loses marks for  having the only online help assistant who is more annoying then the  MS-Office Paperclip one! (Luckily you can turn him off!)I stopped  playing it after a week. So will true Sim Fans. Bring on another RCT add on  pack!
