Folks, I have used this program since its initial iteration appeared in DOS about 1988-89 (I forget whether it was on the Apple IIe or an early Compaq).  The steady improvements over the years have been expected and wonderful - except for 2007.  I have been fustrated to no end.  Its behind-the-scenes programming has glitches.  Can't even add things correctly nor report as "income" items that are plainly in the forms and back-ups. I'd love the $35,000+ refund to which the the program insists I am entitled.  BUT, I'd never send these papers to the IRS. I guess I'll have to look at turbo tax or one of the freeware suites.  It seems 18-19 years on a program may be the limit !!

Just tried to e-file my taxes with this product. After 2 unsuccessful attempts, I checked their FAQ for transmission problems. (See for yourself at [...] then click e-filing, transmission errors, connectivity problems) They recommend disabling your anti-virus software, disabling your firewall and circumventing your router. Apparently, they don't want you to protect your very valuable personal information at ALL!! I'm horrified. These are basics!! If you're going to e-file I recommend looking elsewhere.

Most software vendors have figured out the basics of pagination.  TaxCut deluxe, on the other hand, offers you the wonderful 'feature' of splitting your 'for my records' copy in mid line.  This product should be labled 'Scotch tape not included.'
It would also be nice if it didn't flag errors for forms it somehow decided I needed to file even though there was nothing filled in on them.

This program stinks! First of all, it took me forever to do my taxes on this d*** thing. Then we had to download the State Taxes after it said on the box that it was included with the Federal Taxes. Next, when all was said and done (yea right!) it said I had warnings and erros but it didn't say how to fix it. After many screams and hollers, I was ready to e-file (a big joke!); I had to fill out even more paper work then I did when I had to do it by snail mail. And I couldn't even print it out for snail mail! Whoever made this program, must have been a nerd who got picked on a lot and this is their revenge.
  This program stinks, stay away from it and do what you normally do. All this does is ask you bogus questions about, God knows what, and you're left with anger and fustration. I'd give this a big fat ZERO if I could but it gets a one by default.

I've used H&R block software in the past, this is the first time I was disappointed with the software.
I had nothing but problems and I am not a computer neophyte.  Even the printing of the tax papers became a
problem.  I don't know if this software version was rushed through or what the problem is, but it sure isn't up to
their standards.

I have used TaxCut for 4 years, ever since TurboTax decided that customers should be marketed to death with in product ads.
This year while I'm paying for a state download, the marketing ads are the only thing that works. My credit card was charged, but no download screen. IE errors when trying to print the reciept, I had to use a Mozilla based HTML reader after saving the email to disk. Why does a email reciept have to be so loaded with HTML ads for nonrelated products that IE creates script errors?
I never did get the state download, the web pages never load. I can't ask for help, no email address ever appears and a telephone call is $10.00.
I don't want to go back to Intuit and the endless ads. Now Turbotax is a "maximum marketing" product as well.

This is a clunky program with a design that feels like freeware.  If you buy a companion program like TaxCut DeLuxe that let's you get DeductionPro free after rebate, then it's worth the 37 cents postage you pay to process the rebate.  The program's terrible, but the pre-programmed fair market values can save you time and money.

1)  It freaked out about a 1099-INT with 30 cents of interest on it.

2)  Even worse, it totally barfed about a return that has both health insurance off the exchange and someone over 65.  Never mind that the person with the exchange policy was not the same person as the one that's over 65.  Had subsidies been involved this would have been a showstopper.
With every update it automatically reboots your computer, without warning.  If Turbo Tax had not attempted to cheat their customer's last year (by removing forms from the Deluxe Edition), I'd go back to them.  Maybe it's time for paper, pencil and calculator.
This software had us owing over $700.00. We knew something was wrong so on top of the $26.00 I paid for the software I then went to have a tax person look them over for another $30.00. Apparently the software automatically puts numbers in that it shouldn't. Bottom line, we did them over ourselves and got a return of over $2,000.00 which is about our usual amount. I begged my husband to try this software. Never again.

NNothing but a headache as compared to turbo tax.  I gave up on blocks and upgraded to turbo tax premier buying it from Sam's Club for only 54.00.  Bj's had it for the same price.  TurboTax has seen the error of their way and is giving those who had to upgrade a 25.00 rebate.  Additionally they are putting all the schedules they deleting back into the deluxe version.  Public pressure does work especially when it hits a company's bottom line.
Beware, if you want direct deposit, these S.O.B's charge you another $39.00. I will never buy this item again!!!
Do not be a fool like me.... AVOID THIS PRODUCT.

My mother worked for H&R Block for many years, so I have no personal problem with them.

I have not used the 2004, but I just quit working on the 2002 edition.  I got halfway through my return (20 hours work) and I finally quit.  The numbers were incorrect, but I did not notice until the last few entries.

I have rental properties and, even though I entered the information where it belonged, it somehow got transferred elsewhere.  All of my real estate taxes got moved from where they belonged to form A.  Entering the information directly onto the tax forms required me to override every single step (3 mouse clicks, I think?).  Also, I was not able to go to help and figure out what my standard mileage cost was, so it took me considerable time to go through their mileage dialogue boxes when all I wanted was standard mileage.

I had used Turbo Tax in previous years and was not unhappy with them; however, I had heard that Turbo Tax put spyware on the computer, and that it was difficult to install on more than one computer, so I decided to opt for a change.  TaxCut was cheaper, and I figured there would really be no difference (I used Parson's tax software years ago and liked them until they stopped making that program).  Anyway, at least for year 2002, TaxCut is much worse than Turbo Tax and Parson's old tax program.  The big problem is, it puts information in the wrong place; and I have been doing my own taxes for 20 years, so it is not a mistake which I am making.

I downloaded TaxAct just a moment ago; it is cheaper than either turbo tax or taxcut, and so far, it behaves just like it is supposed to.  I have been entering some info by their prompts and other info directingly onto the tax forms, and, except for the fact that the auto-save requires me to hit the hardreturn every time, other than that, I really like TaxAct. It is functioning exactly how it is supposed to.  Furthermore, I have entered in a couple of properties and printed it out, and everything is going where it belongs.

I was one of the long time users of Turbotax who switched over (briefly) to H&R Block because of TurboTax's ridiculous, colossal mistake in judgment - please do not take my comments here as supporting in any way, shape, or form, the unbelievable error in judgment that TurboTax made when it tried to remove widely used investment schedules/forms from its Deluxe Edition.  Everything seemed to be going well when I tried using H&R Block Deluxe - it converted my data from 2013 on my new iMac just fine, and I was making my way through everything fairly easily.  As a general matter, I like the presentation of TurboTax a bit better than H&R Block - it summarizes your income and deductions at various points in the program as you navigate through it, and compares your current information with past years.  H&R Block doesn't seem to have any those extra features, which are really not necessary, but kind of nice.  H&R Block Deluxe is straightforward and seems to have everything I would have needed to file my tax return.  Unfortunately, while I was entering my charitable deductions, I received an unexpected error, the program quit, and I lost about 2 hours of information for my charitable deductions.  I really, really wanted this software to work, but I can't risk re-entering my information.  I feel that I have no choice but to switch back to Turbotax now that they have seen the error of their ways and included a free upgrade.  Sorry H&R Block.  I am reluctantly returning your software.  I guess I wasn't ready for you, or at least, your software wasn't ready for me.  Maybe next year.
Well, We've used HR Block for probably 20 years and it's worked fine every year.  This year I got to the end of preparing my return and got this notice:  "Since you're claiming the self-employed health insurance deduction and have marketplace health insurance, your return requires additional calculations that aren't part of our program.  To file an accurate return, we recommend you complete your return with an H&R Block tax professional.  You must fix this problem before filing."

My first thought was why I wasn't warned about this perhaps a month ago when I entered this data (it actually walked me through the questions regarding self employment and health insurance and those sections have the green checks on them)?  I was waiting until now to file because I was waiting for some late arriving investment forms to complete.  This brick of a statement sets me back to starting over with another program.

A quick web search of this error text turns up a blog that points out this same problem that others are having with HR Block.  It says Turbotax and TaxAct seem to handle this properly.  Very disappointed with HR Block.  Wasted my money and time on it.  Just purchased Turbo Tax.

You've been warned.  At least I have a couple weeks to redo things in another program.

Egregious software and awful behavior by H&R.

After spending hours preparing my tax return on H&R Premium, I just encountered an evil error, related to the ACA premiums / Form 1095-A.  After googling, apparently many users have encountered this while using H&R.  Basically, the software says:

"Since you're claiming the ACA premium tax credit and the self-employed health insurance deduction, your return requires additional calculations that aren't part of the program. To file an accurate return, we recommend you complete your return with an H&R Block Tax professional.  You must fix this problem before filing.

The software doesn't allow me to fix the error myself and file.  There is zero warning about this issue beforehand.  Basically, the user is forced to pay much more money to use a H&R Block Tax professional.

TaxCut installs third party software without your knowledge, consent or permission. The application is called Software995 and it's basically a PDF editor. Why anyone would need a PDF editor to do their taxes is something TaxCut refuses to answer. Software995 is covertly installed when you download updates for TaxCut. Sorry, you get Software995 installed without choice.
Software995 is ad-based. So if you intend on using it, you will have to endure endless popup ads from their sponsors. And no, you can't get rid of them using a popup blocker. To eliminate the ads you have to pay $9.95.
I think it's very unprofessional of H&R Block to shove 3rd party software down it's customers throats. Are they that hard up for money?
TaxCut and TuboTax both work as far as getting the job done. So my advice would be to get the one without adware.

Errors in State Taxes. Refused to let me E-file with a Childcare provider that is an individual.

If I specify the Childcare provider's SSN as XXX-XX-XXXX  I am unable to e-file error message says the EIN must be XX-XXXXXXX format. If I change it to that format the message says it must be in the XXX-XX-XXXX format.

Same childcare provider as I e-filed with last years version, I'm about ready to ask for a refund
I got it last year for free after rebate.  (Well, free after a 6 month battle with H&R Block on them honoring the rebate.)  It is quite possible the hardest to use software ever sold.  If they gave you an Excel spreadsheet with tables it would be EASIER and more functional.  I'm not kidding.

The software in question is actually PDF995 and is made by a company named Software995.  It is known to interfere with the normal operation of various Adobe products.  It is more than unprofessional for H & R Block to install this program without permission, it is unethical.  If they had clearly disclosed this program and made its installation optional, I would have no problem with it.  I assume they are being paid for installing this junk on my machine, as a form of advertising for the Software995 company.  I am extremely angry at having been tricked into paying for this advertisment, having been duped into installing untested and unwanted software, and having to now go through the trouble of uninstalling this crap, fully investigating it to determine what it may have done, and correcting any resulting issues.  I have used TaxCut for many years.  I will be uninstalling it and returning it for a refund, and will never buy it again.  This behavior, by a company that I trusted with my most sensitive financial information, is appalling.
Tax cut installs adware on your computer when you do the update. The adware is pdfedit995 and software 995. When I pay for a piece of software I don't expect to be bombarded with ads or have third party software installed in my computer asking me for more money. The adware is installed without any notice to you or option not to install it.

I will not be buying Tax Cut next year. I recommend choosing something else.

Terrible product. When filling out EIN it defaults to a format of xx-xxxxxxx and will not allow for a standard EIN of xxxxxxxxxx. My refund is constantly rejected and I continuously am charged for a refiling fee. The only support that I received from customer service was that there is "there is nothing we can do". Furthermore they still have not offered a refund for their terrible product. I will never use this product again.
the program have string limitation on Health Care Information carrier field.
and my insurance company name happened to be  "Massachusetts XXXX Administrators LLC".
so instead sending the full string number, the software decide to truncate it .......
the my state return is rejected because this string truncated error.

My quibble is with the Business section, as it is really limited business.  A competing product includes forms like 1065 which a family partnership would need.  This leaves the product incomplete, and I feel Intuit is being disingenuous in their representation of the product.
BEWARE no interview for 1120's you will be directed to IRS webpage to fill out a adobe form, you have to do the math your self dispite a quote from H & R Prepare and E-file Business Returns

We will guide you through preparing and E-filing business returns, including corporations and S corporations (Form 1120 and 1120S), partnerships and LLCs (Form 1065), estates and trusts (Form 1041), and non-profits (Form 990). You can E-file up to 5 personal returns and unlimited business returns. NOT SO
How can a product claiming to have "all the forms you need to file Schedule C- sole proprietor/home-base business" NOT have the capability to create a form W-2 or W-3??!!!
Don't even bother...Even an excel spreadsheet is easier than this.  There is no way to enter multiple different items that were given on the same date.  You have to type the date for each item individually (not even a copy/paste function).  When looking up the value of an item you have to go through multiple menu's that aren't arranged well.  Very clunky and disappointing.

I am using TaxCut Business to prepare a simple Form 1041 for a trust.  This has to be the WORST example of tax software I have EVER come accross.  Entry boxes that will not take an entry without an override, endless loops (entry comes from another forms entry box which comes from the  first box, which comes from the 2nd box, which comes from the 1st box ....), inability to reaccess an itemized list after it is created, inability to move around between forms without going back to the interview and taking a wild guess, and a totally useless help section, just to mention a few.  What a piece of grabage.  This apparantly is produced by an outfit named ATX II LLC and bears no resemblence to the personal version for your 1040. Dont even THINK about paying good money for this.
It is awful. The interview process asks all the easy, basic stuff, but when it comes to the tough parts like filling out schedules, you're on your own.
The "free state software" is not the business edition. It's for personal taxes. Pure deceit. And guess what? The only place you can buy the Business Tax State edition is through TaxCut for another [$$$].  Pure greed.

I needed Home and Business,  but mainly Business.  Thinking the Premium was everything, but finding out only for home and  not business
Not useful, errors. This product is cumbersome - it is like something from the 1980's. I expected something useful and more up to date.

Same thing every year with H&R and their silly games.
Why they can't provide estimated tax forms for both state and federal is a
mystery.
Rental income is the same kind of @#@# - if you have a number of rentals
occupied 100% then H&R assume that the monthly income is constant for an
entire year ...
Do you know the difference between real estate tax and property tax on the
2015 tax forms.  It turns out that it is the same meaning on my forms -
WTH.

Tax used to insist that you install an old obsolete version of M$ Internet

Bought this because I didn't want the extra hidden software that installs with Turbo Tax.  It messed up the icons on my desktop, jumped back and forth when I entered data, continually returning to the box to enter my middle initial.  MUCH less straightforward than TurboTax, which I used last year and actually bought again this year.  I just gave up on TaxCut and chalked the wasted money up to a learning experience.

Willpower is acceptable, as far as its function goes.  It provides a scheme for detailing your assets, and a boilerplate Will and Last text.  It's not clear, however, that the scheme couldn't be done comparably with a spreadsheet.  In addition, the Will and Last text often needs editing, for the legal language is convoluted so it can be massaged by a computer program to handle the cases checked.

However, Kiplinger provides NO UPGRADE from one year's Willpower to another, something which you'd think would be important as laws change.  I was talked into buying a completely new version, which I did.  Guess what:  The new version has NO MEANS OF IMPORTING INFORMATION from the older version.  That means you have to enter all your property all over again.

The lack of a means of importing information is why I rated this at One Star.  Otherwise it'd get a Three Stars.

I cannot think of a single reason you should have to click 3 buttons and go through 2 screens to enter 1 stock transaction.  On the contrary, you should be able to enter 10 or more per screen.  It took hours to enter 200 stock transactions.

Then, after the error check, certain transactions seemed to be duplicated.  Upon trying to delete them with the delete button, they would not delete.  If you change one of the duplicates, the contents of the other changes also.  Then, looking through the list, I find that every one of the other duplicate transactions were duplicated again each time I tried to delete the first duplicated transaction pair.  Now I have dozens of transactions that will not delete - after spending 2 days doing data entry and using the interviews for doing all data entry and changes, as the product recommends - - - even though it is excruciating slow work with the poor user interface design.

What a piece of junk.  (And this was the final 2003 version - - - the one with all the latest fixes!)

This software is unbelievably bad.  It appears to have been written for Windows 3.1, as it cannot deal with anything but 8.3 filenames.  The Okay button for many dialogs is absolutely huge and placed behind text entry fields -- must be seen to be believed.
The installer hangs at 99% or 100% under WinXP for at least 8 minutes, then proceeds.  It never exits, though, and must be killed with task manager.
I got this software bundled in the Money 2003 Suite, and paid a little extra to get it.  Don't know how I'm going to get my money back for it.

When importing from Quicken, it incorrectly imported dozens of transactions from a 401(k) account. The program consistently crashes when I try to delete a stock transaction--I guess I'll have to leave that transaction in.
I understand the limitations of these will writing programs. They are intended for simple, yet legal wills, that rely on standard text. I didn't have any special needs. I merely wanted to leave everything to my wife.
The program is split into three sections - Plan Wizard, Estate Manager, and Will Writer. Plan Wizard is an interview that allows you to document all of your assets and debts.
Estate Manager appears to only allow you to append the portfolio you just created. You can't actually change anything existing in the portfolio. You can only add stuff to it. I noticed some spelling errors in my portfolio. Since Estate Manager doesn't allow you to make changes, I went back to the Plan Wizard, made the changes there and did a save. Nothing. The changes did not take. Apparently the wizard is a one-shot deal.
Then I tried to use the Will Writer. I couldn't get it to work. I was expecting another interview like that in the Plan Wizard. Nothing. No buttons or menu commands. No pop-up menu. Thinking I was missing something really obvious, I clicked on Help. Nothing. I could not get help to work. I went to their web site and the only support offered was an email address. There's no software updates, no FAQ's, no system of support at all.
I expected a lot more than this from a product bearing the name of Kiplinger's. This piece of junk won't even let you exit the program without saving the file (which it doesn't actually do).
WillPower uses software technology at least 7 years old. It is plagued with errors. Do you really want to trust the future of your estate to this?
A seal on the box claims that it is 100% guaranteed or your money back. I'm going to find out whether that claim actually holds True...

I switched to Tax Cut Deluxe because of the spy ware and CD Rom protection issues with Intuit TurboTax last year.  (TurboTax's CD Rom protection software disabled a few of my video games, and was difficult to uninstall.)
Unfortunately, I'm experiencing several problems with H&R Block's Tax Cut Deluxe.

1. I need to use the K-1 Partnership/S Corporation worksheet, and Form 6198.  Tax Cut will not allow me to file until H&R Block releases a patch, scheduled for "early February."
2. I can't obtain the H&R Block State software until the end of February.
The software is cheaper then Intuit's by a fair margin, and as a BETA product, it shows promise.  But it should be ready to go NOW.
Given that Tax Cut has a "100% Satisfaction 60-day Money-Back Guarantee", and that I won't be able to obtain a working product for more than 30 days, I'm considering calling this product "unsatisfactory" and exercising my right to a refund.

I usually use a different product, but after their gouging this year I figured why not - time to shake things up. No one likes reading through the mile-long EULA or privacy policies, but I like to at least skim them to pretend I'm informed. Disclaimer - I have only glanced at TurboTax's privacy policy before writing this review, I have not actually assessed it. I'm not advocating using a particular software, I just want you as a user to be aware of what you agree to when you use this software. Some clauses that alarmed me, directly from their privacy policy:

"We may also use your information, as permitted by law, to service and report on your account and to offer you relevant information, products, or services. These activities may be performed by use or a service provider acting on our behalf."

-So they can give out my information to other parties to... provide services. Seeing as that's associated with offering me 'relevant products' I'd rather not let them gather my information to give to people to sell me things.

"We treat the data of everyone who comes to our websites in accordance with this Privacy Notice, whatever their "do not track" setting. While we do not respond to web browser "do not track" signals, we give you choices about receiving promotional offers from us or third-parties."

-This is a fancy way of saying that they do not care about what options you've elected in your browser (your preferences), they are only beholden to their Privacy Notice (completely dictated by them).

"We keep your information for as long as needed or as required by law"

-So, forever. H&R is a business, businesses always need to sell services. The Privacy Notice authorizes them to use your information to sell services. They will always need your information.

"We maintain appropriate safeguards to protect your information."

-This is the extent they are willing to give you in their Privacy Notice. Given the sensitivity of the information involved and the amount of data they collect (and send to third parties), good luck keeping it secure. To be fair, I didn't really have hope that they would in the first place - how many other data breaches happen every month - I was just looking for something more than "we secure your data... appropriately."

H&R Block does have a third party reviewing their privacy policy (TRUSTe - [...], which looks like it ensures they are in compliance with their own policy. Unfortunately, it's being in compliance with their policy that makes me cringe. There are other more nitpicky things that also make me sigh - installing cookies to track my behavior, for one - but these I felt were the big ones. If what you read here does not bother you and you think this product is a good fit for you, then by all means purchase it. I gave it a 2nd star because it comes with a 60 day refund policy (if you submit it in writing to their office in Kansas City), and while I waited about 10 minutes on hold to speak with someone the person I spoke with was very friendly and helpful.

Minor word edits 1/24 for clarity.
While the program is great,the customer support system is lacking.  I called the 800 phone number for a recorded message that directed me to a long distance phone number.  When I dialed that phone number, another voice message instructed me to dial a different long distance phone number.  Two long distance phone calls later I spoke with a customer service representative that was not very helpful.

In order to use the software you must first click a box and agree to the H&R BLOCK privacy policy, which is presented in a pop-up window.  The privacy policy presented to me allows H&R BLOCK to collect and use for their own business purposes, among other things, the following information about me and my family members:

"  - Social Security Number and other government identification numbers (e.g., EIN and ITIN)
  - Date of Birth
  - Financial Information (e.g., income, revenue, assets, credits, deductions, and expenses)
  - Payment Data (e.g., checking, debit and credit card account numbers, balances and payment history)
  - Health Information (e.g., health insurance status and financial information related to payment for healthcare services)"

I called the information number in provided in the policy for "questions or complaints regarding our privacy practices or principles," and I was in turn directed to call two additional numbers within H&R BLOCK.  None of the three customer service people I spoke with was prepared to explain the policy or answer my questions.

I see no reason why a software vendor should claim the right to collect and use this kind of highly-private information for their own commercial purposes.  I refused to agree to the policy and I am therefore seeking a refund for the software.  From now on I'll do my returns on my own and keep corporate America out of the loop.
Regrettably, this software excludes Macs.
Funny thing. I read these reviews about turbo tax. I actually had started hating turbo tax some time ago, when I could no longer import tax data because I couldn't find the file on my computer. All the complaints people made about it is True. I was reading and saying to myself, that's True.  I was relieved to some degree that they had taken ownership and gave some positive responses.  It was too late for me.  What now, about 13 years of Turbo Tax, I'm outta there.  But I wanted to point out, don't make the saving solution HR Block. Talking about a programming mess. If you click on "check for updates automatically,"  and then follow after inputting all your Fed info, and then follow the wizard to download state, its over for you.  Your frustration begins with a whole new type of headache.  Who would know?  It's like a trap that if you choose it, you loose.  You hang from that point on.  Call em up ....no one answers, just continuous recorded dialog about features, and the recordings cut into each other leaving you to believe, finally, a live person will take the call.  Nope, the fact is, it was just an overlapping thrilling announcement that will be intercepted again, by the earlier announcement.,  Pretty clever.  You keep having your hopes unfulfilled but with another hopeful promise,  for HOURS. not minutes.  They know about the stalemate too, they know this problem exists, and they have not announced a fix and worse yet, they have not made announcement that we NOT choose the auto-update option.  Why?  Too risky during tax season?  Where will I go?  I better just get a tax pro.  I'm sick of systems rich people put in place with no regard to the struggles average people have to go through.  If they cared, they would have made an announcement.

Spent tremendous amount time to chat and talk to H&R reps for ONE very very simple issue - to attached a "signature" form to efile. Multiple reps asked for the symptom again and again and again but always failed to capture, not to mention to identify root causes. Reps appear not well trained, unable to do simple trouble shooting, in one or two cases can't even navigate through the software interface. Chat session doesn't allow screen share, send screenshot, can't even copy paste error message!!! Overall it is a very unprofessional product combined with less unknowable reps, and those are US onshore reps, can you imagine one rep took one hour 17 minutes on the phone then just provided me an email address where I can attach a tax file for further trouble shooting?

If you want an unrepsonsive, cookie cutter program that looks like it was thrown together in a weekend, than this is the product for you.  You can also expect some erroneous error code when you try to e-file, that is neither listed in their help file, or in their knowledge base online.  Just an error like Fatal Error UNDEFINED_SOCKET_ERROR.  Then you'll find there is no way to actually speak with a human being about your problem (unless you want to buy it of course).  So you'll send an email, five days later you'll get a response like try closing tax cut and re-sending it, what a revelation why didn't I try that, oh that's right I did.  Seriously too much of a head ache, horrible support if there even is any support.  And from a technical persons perspective a truly terrible peice of software.

Program seemed to work until I went to e-file.  I got an error message saying that "when filing form 1120S, the following supporting forms are not allowed: 8453-S."  so I deleted it.  Then the error message said "Signed and scanned 8453-C, 8453-S, or 8453-I is required to be attached as a pdf document to this return." but when I attach it again (as I had before) I get the first error message.  Chat and phone call were no help.  They just told me that 1120-S forms need to be mailed, which I cannot believe.
Moved? Part-year residence? check before you buy this. It lets you download the Hawaii state software & then tells you "to fill out the PAPER form for Hawaii by yourself (yes, do you own calculations) because you are a part-time resident of Hawaii"? then you have to fill out forms to get your refund for the useless state and refused to reimburse me for the federal! Apparently Hawaii may not be the only state they don't support part-year-residence as of 2015; this issue has nothing to do with support for online efiling.
Unable to handle schedule K-1 properly, software has nasty bugs which corrupted my data - (1) in Rentals and Royalties section, after I entered the data for schedule K-1, the data in rental properties section was corrupted!  resulted in a unrealistic big loss there, therefore rendered the return totally useless. I also tried to delete the corrupted items but the software won't allow it (no response after I clicked on Delete).  (2) the design of the bona fide residence test was boneheaded, once you click any two of the options on that page, there's no way you can come back and try the other (physical presence) test (see the attached screen capture).
Sirs, I bought TaxCut Standard on January 17 and found that it does not allow me to progress past "do you want to download updates now?"  (That is bad because the existing software is said to be of November vintage.)  When I try to download I am told that I do not have an internet connection.  (I did.)  So I took the software back and asked for a refund.  BestBuy agreed that the software is useless as is.  [...]

No value to me.  No software update.  No refund.  BestBuy (Atlanta, Perimeter Center) agreed that to continue to sell that product would only harm the good reputation of BestBuy.

One star seems generous to me.

I tried Tax Cut instead of Turbo Tax this year and was terribly frustrated.  If you have moved from one state to another, yet have W2's to file from the first state, Tax Cut changes your residence state to the state of the employer on your first W2.  If you change the residence state back, it changes the employer's state.  Their Technical Support was unaware of this problem and were unable to help solve it.  I finally fixed it by listing as the first W2 one from an employer in my state of current residence.
To make matters worse, I bought the State program.  If you don't do the above fix -- still unknown to Tax Cut -- the program won't recognize that your W2's show you paid any taxes in the state of prior residence.
The final strike came when I discovered Tax Cut State will not allow me to file electronically with my state of prior residence.  I can only do it with my state of current residence.  Again, I called their Technical Support.  I was told that's the way the software is designed.  When I pleaded that they neglected to include this information in the software ads and packaging, it was explained to me that the readme file included this information, as if that should have informed me of the restriction before I bought the software.
This software is quirky, buggy, and unprofessional.  Don't buy it.

If you have a Mac with a Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled) filesystem, this software WILL NOT WORK.  (You will see ? questions marks where the buttons are supposed to be along with missing help documentation and numerous other errors)

You can test to see if you will have this problem by clicking on your computer drive and performing a File->Get Info. If under format you see "Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled)", you will have a problem. If you see this: "Mac OS Extended (Journaled)", you should be fine.

== TO H&R Block CUSTOMER SUPPORT ==
Please fix this issue which has plagued your software for years.  If you have any question about why it is broken, feel free to contact me.
Initially, the software downloaded, installed, and updated perfectly fine.  However due to programming issues, button graphics are all displayed as blue question marks.  Attempts to access help files are unsuccessful as well. This is a result of programming referring to all cap (FILENAME.XML) files when they are actually (FileName.xml) sentence case name format. As other reviewers have stated, this program does not work if you have a currently formatted HD as Mac OS Extended (Case-sensitive, Journaled).  Check File->Get Info before buying and downloading.  If you have Mac OS Extended (Journaled), you should be fine. Based on other reviews, this appears to be an issue since the 2013 edition of the software. I re-downloaded the software from Amazon a total of 3 times to ensure it wasn't something caused by transit. I uninstalled and removed all cache and .plist files, then reattempted installation. Everything goes smoothly, but the software is unusable as-is.  You can manage to make it through a few of the steps, but simply by guessing the right button to click. I WAS successful in importing last years TurboTax return, but eventually I reached a point that I couldn't make it go to the next step without clear buttons.

Amazon does not offer refunds for downloaded software (boo), so I just spent the last 1 1/2 hours with H&R Block software support.  I spoke to a very sweet and helpful agent who kindly walked me through the uninstall and reinstall process. She eventually provided me a link for a direct download from H&R Block, but that proved ineffective as well.  Instead of escalating the issue, I asked the agent if she had the authority to issue refunds. With some trepidation she did grant me the authorization for a refund and gave me the address to submit my order confirmation.  I should see a check in a few weeks.

I was hoping to be a new convert to H&R this year after decades of being a TurboTax user. I'm really sorry this didn't work for me.  Unless I decide to reformat my HD, I guess it's TurboTax for another year.  See these reviews for more details and possible workarounds: http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PZSU0YLRXCWI/ref=cm_cr_rdpvoterdr?_encoding=UTF8&thanksvoting=cr-vote-R2PZSU0YLRXCWI#R2PZSU0YLRXCWI.2115.

Terrible and unintuitive UI, especially the navigation. There's no way to search for the particular section you're looking for either.
If I could, I'd demand a refund. I'll likely end up eating the $32 and buying TurboTax again.
WARNING - Yout can't import data from Taxact, despite claim from Block's website that you can.  http://www.hrblock.com/taxes/partner/product.jsp?productId=31&otpPartnerID=2438#
Scam. Does not include State. State will cost additional $40 if you get this.

will make you regret that you bought it.  It barely even ran on my Mac in Classic mode, and would not run at all in OS X, athough it states that it is supported.
I really can't say enough bad things about this application; even when I did get it running under Classic, the quality of the application was just awful.  Horrible unintuitive interfact, poor "interview" process, and poor results.  It's difficult to use if you can get it to run at all.  I will I could return it.
They should take this off the market... Do it right or not at all.

Horrible download support and service from Amazon.  Good luck trying to download this software from Amazon- myself and 2 office co-workers could not download the software.
Your best bet is to goto the store and buy the CD.

Software gave XML error and File Header Block errors on multiple attempts to prepare tax return.  Ultimately had to use other software to prepare return.  Complete waste of money!

Deluxe + State H&R Block.  Installation worked fine on 2 machines in 2012.

I was able to installed 2013 Delux + State H&R software on one computer.  When attempting to install software on second machine(H&R advertises that you can do that), the unlock code was never accepted.  Try zero then "oh".  Their email used capital letters for the unlock code.  The verify code on line used small case letters.  Sharp people never use one or zero, no letters O or L.

I needed phone help:  No one answered on Presidents Day or even announced they were closed for the holiday-45 minutes lost.  Tuesday 18 February, I spent over 2 hours mostly on hold.  No music, just words for H&R sales people.  First person did not understand how the windows software and H&R installed in tandem.  She wanted to resell the software, but I did not want double billing.  After 45 minutes with her, she transferred me to a second person (another 30 minute wait).  When #2 could not help, she said she would forward me to the "digital department".  After 30 minutes on hold, #3 answer and had not heard of the digital department.  She understood the start button and how to begin the CD again.  I knew she was sharper.  I could tell a supervisor was counseling her.  Noone wanted to share their names.

"Just enter your activation code" was suggested; a real code but the software was not built for this code for 2013. "I will give you an over ride code", I knew I needed this but that code would not work.  I also asked for help install Apple MAC software-my fall back choice, again I was not helped.  Wasted 6 hours so far.  IRS estimated I could have completed 3 forms by hand in about 2 hrs each.

It must be really hard for these phone people to help when the software is flawed.

Buyer beware of H&R Block's software this year.  If you wait until the last minute, they might have a software fix or some better training for their staff.  Good luck.  Hope it all works better for you.

***Update,  After I wrote this review, H&R forwarded a special link by E-Mail.  That link was for a free copy of 2013 that I could load to my computer.  It worked.  Hope that the "help people" have the authority and knowlege to help others now.
UPDATE 2/6 - Block posted an update almost immediately after I posted this review. However, an additional problem became apparent - the program ran a charge for the State filing fee every time I attempted to efile and then received the error message that I would have to update first. So the $19.95 charge was posted SIX TIMES. Only one charge cleared, but the other five charges are still pending in my account and I am told by my bank that because H&R block didn't cancel them that my funds will blocked until Monday - a full week later.  This despite the fact that when the Tier 3 tech called me I sent them documentation of the pending charges. I was promised that the pending charges would be canceled, but that did not happen. Block, you've been great in the past, but not this year.

UPDATE 2/8 - despite forwarding the information last week, my account is still blocked with -$100 in pending charges from H&R Block. I would love to talk with them personally about this, but I'm on hold. I'm sure that they're allowing me all that extra time just so I can let all of you know that I'm a week into this debacle.

I completed my federal and state returns but the program would not e-file either. I received an error message "You must update the program before you e-file" but the earliest update shown in the window is 16 days from today's date.

Upon calling Block customer service at 1-800-472-5625, I was told by the customer service rep that Iid have to wait until the update is available on the 18th to file. I then asked to speak with a supervisor  - who did her best to assist me but was unable to find a solution. Then I was informed that my  "case" (no available update)  would be escalated to a Tier 3 representative, but the wait time was such that no one would be able to call me back for another 24 to 48 hours. "Ok!" I said  "I'm off to Amazon to make sure that the other consumers know that there are unsolved problems with your software! Thank you so much for providing me with this opportunity to provide this service to your customers. I certainly wouldn't wan them to experience the same level of frustration that I am!"

Just to clarify - there is no software error with the filing. The program simply will no allow e-filing until it is updated and there is no update available until the "estimated" dates I gave above. However there IS A CRITICAL BUG that will send a pending charge your account EACH time you attempt to file and get a notice from the software that you are required to update before filing!! I will update in this review if this issue is addressed by H&R Block and or resolved. I've used H&R Block for many years with great success, but having to delay filing for over two weeks while waiting for an update is unacceptable
The one star rating is not about the Tax Cut software, which I've used for many years, but rather Amazon's software download service.  Thinking I would be environmentally friendly and skip the packing and shipping, I opted to purchase TaxCut via Amazon download rather than the boxed set. It turned into a multi-hour headache that ultimately never worked, despite the fact that I am a CompTIA A+ certified computer technician with years of experience configuring and troubleshooting systems.  Buyer beware:

1) Nowhere on the product description front-page does Amazon tell you that you first need to install the "Amazon Games & Software Downloader" software onto your computer.  There is no direct download link to the TaxCut software.

2) The Amazon Games & Software Downloader software has serious flaws.  After installation, I repeatedly received an "update required" error message when trying to download TaxCut -- even though I had just installed the latest version.  Uninstalling, rebooting, redownloading and reinstalling the software twice did not resolve the issue.

3) I sent an email to tech support, which responded simply that this error "is typically associated with a personal firewall or network blocking internet access of the Amazon Games & Software Downloader."  I disabled both the built-in Windows firewall and plugged the computer directly into the cable modem to bypass the router's firewall altogether, still to no luck.

4) Fed up with the process, I requested a refund since I had never successfully downloaded the TaxCut software or obtained a licensing code.  I was informed that "software downloads are not returnable once they've been purchased.  Since you are having trouble downloading, we highly recommend calling for further troubleshooting steps."

5) I called the tech support number (technically they called me, since you have to enter your phone number on a web page and wait for a call-back, which admittedly happened almost immediately.)  The first call dropped, a glitch the VoIP system they seem to use.  They second call connected me to a very nice, but technically limited young man who kept reading to me generic "fixes" from a script.  When I asked him which ports the Amazon Games & Software Downloader actually used, he had to go ask his supervisor (and never got a response.)  His final "solution" was that I should find another computer on which to attempt the download, then burn the file to a CD and load it onto my main computer from the CD.  At that point, I simply refused to continue with this debacle and he admitted that they have had a lot of similar issues with the software and it is currently being revised.  He finally agreed to issue a credit for the purchase.

Long story short: Amazon's download process is still only half cooked.  If you run into problems, you'll have to jump through hoops before they agree to refund the money.  Save yourself a great deal of hassle and buy the boxed set for just a dollar more with free shipping.
So, I'm a long time H&R Block Tax software customer.  I've always been happy with the product, and the price - way less than TurboTax or a human.  That said, I just battled a frustrating install process and finally figured out the problem.  After installing 2013, the first order of business was to download a software update (Federal).  The update downloaded, and then failed during update.  The software went into this cycle of prompting for an update, failing to install it (would get to about 80% and then roll back), then prompting for an update again.  After cycling through this a few times and failing, I uninstalled 2013, re-installed, and proceeded to battle the same issue.

After an hour of frustration I thought to myself, I wonder if having H&R Block 2012 on my machine is causing a problem?  So, I uninstalled 2012, uninstalled 2013, then re-installed 2013 and voila, problem solved.  So, if any of you out there have 2012 installed (or potentially any other version), and you are having install/update problems - I would remove previous versions first!

Software conflicts happen, I get it.  The reason for the two-star review is because the conflict isn't addressed AT ALL by the 2013 software.  The 2013 software should have checked for previous versions during install and prompted for removal.  At minimum, a warning or disclaimer should have been provided with the product detailing this as part of the install instructions.  At BARE MINIMUM, they would have posted something about this on their online support page.  Considering they left me to battle this for an hour before eventually solving the problem on my own, I'm not real thrilled with them to start this year's tax season.  This is disappointing because I generally start my taxes with a feeling of happiness, euphoria really - and they took this feeling of joy away from me...

Other comments are also correct about the unnecessary up-sell attempt to premium - before they even know if you NEED it.  If you need to file a state return be sure to pay the extra $$$ now and buy this version with state included (vs. Deluxe without state) - they charge more to bolt it on within the software.
Do not buy this product or trust this company. I completed and efiled my federal return, and completed but did not efile my state return. I saved my returns intending to print them later. When I went back to the program, after first installing the updates it prompted me to, it behaved as if it had never been used before, asked for my activation key again and showed no saved returns on my machine. I searched my entire machine for the file extension (.t13) and no returns were found anywhere. It was as if I never created a return at all, despite having successfully filed one of them. I called Support and after several minutes of looking for other solutions the person spoke to  a supervisor and I was informed that this is a KNOWN ISSUE "when the software wasn't purchased directly from us, it's happened with Amazon and retail stores" they said. They said they'd had lots of support calls about it. It doesn't save successfully or retain that the software was activated and used. It treats it like it's being clean installed again. And they KNOW this is a problem, and yet there's no hotfix, not even an eblast to purchasers after they activate warning them to save, and save externally too and save a pdf and just save the crap out of anything you have if you spend time working on your return with this product because it might just vanish. They first mentioned the known issue after asking me what version of Windows I was using (8). They didn't make it clear whether this bug is specific to Windows 8 or not, just that they'd had other calls. Their solution to me was to tell me go to my state's website and download the tax forms there and do my state return manually.  This is completely unacceptable.
BUY THIS ONLY IF YOU'RE NOT FILING STATE - otherwise, buy the Deluxe -- read on --
I downloaded this software from here to my Mac OS X 10.6.8 - no issues at all with the download or the software.  Something on there says it works fine if you have a Mac OS 10. hm.. 10.5? or newer?  not sure exactly which - but I do fall into that situation, so didn't have to do any type of work around.  Issues I had with this -- BUY THE DELUXE Plus Federal Plus STATE - DO IT!  I always had brought the "Plus State" one in the past, and I know you have to pay something more in there (15.99 or 19.99) somewhere during the eFile process.  Without buying the Deluxe (which I need zero deluxe features) PLUS STATE - without that software, H & R charges around $36 for the State software to be added as you go along, plus another 15-20 to file.. plus I'd already bought the at Home Basic plus Fed.. ridiculous and feel duped by H&R, though I'd used the deluxe plus fed and state previously for years.  Please don't make the same costly choice I did - I wish there'd been a warning before.
That said, did it, and got my refunds from both state and fed in about a week.  Easy Peesy.
Only issue in filing was that it was difficult to find my Key Code, since I'd done the online download - had to call H&R cust service - they were great and showed me where to find it in my Amazon account Digital Downloads link.  Glad to get the money back, but feel gyped about the 36+15 on top of my Amazon software purchase.
Waste of my time!
I purchased this software, downloaded it and spent all evening keying in my return. I wasn't completely finished so I saved the file while I gathered additional documents. I started the program again it would not load my saved return. It gave me an error stating "string id insertion failed. already used as a key". I contacted support and they told me my file was corrupt and that I would have to reload all the software and re-key everything I had already done, about 4 hours of work.

I've used H&R block software for the past 4 years but I've always purchased a CD locally, not used a download version. I never will again - I'm switching to another app.

I'm an IT manager - expect better than this.

UPDATE:

Reloaded software, re-keyed everything. Application has a "backup" option so I used this once I had finished, printed to PDF, prior to saving the return. I saved and came back in and my state tax info was missing. I reloaded the backup file and was able to retrieve everything. This software appears to have some serious flaws - don't completely trust it. Also contacted support by phone and requested a refund. Put me on hold for about an hour trying to figure-out what to do. They stated that since I purchased it online I would have to send a LETTER with a sales receipt requesting a refund. A LETTER??? REALLY???? Does this sound like a company you want to buy SOFTWARE from?
1. Imported my Turbo Tax file fairly well. . .some minor edits/additions
2. Process was pretty easy, but I felt like I was missing something as I navigated through the question wizard
3. Submitted electronically (additional fees) and all was good.

Then the US Postal Office delivered a piece of tax forms two weeks late, so I had to go back into the software and fill out a 1040x (Federal) and 540x (State). I got stuck along the way so I attempted to call Support for help.

1. The number provided in the software sent me to 1.800 472 5625, option 2 for Online Support. After waiting 20+ minutes the person said they couldn't help me and said I needed to talk to Software Support. I was given a case number.
2. After another twenty to thirty minute hold, Software support wanted to feed me a knowledgebase article, which didn't answer my question. When it didn't work they said I need to talk to a Tax Advisor and attempted to transfer me. And I got a new case number. Why? I have no idea.
3. I held for another 20+ minutes and did not get a Tax Advisor but the Customer Retention department. Really? I get yet a THIRD case number and am transferred back to Online Support.
4. I ask for a supervisor. . .after yet my FOURTH 20+ minute hold. The supervisor was the first to actually "troubleshoot" my issue and ask me questions even though she was the Online Support supervisor and not the Software Support supervisor. We resolved my issue up to that point and I received my FOURTH case number.

Next day I received one survey for four cases. Survey didn't tell me which case it related to, so I left feedback for all the cases.

I had to call again, but this time I had the direct number for Software Support: 1.888 482 9288
5. First person could not help me after waiting nearly thirty minutes.
Do they not staff for peak seasons there?!?
6. I was transferred again. Held again. Got someone who couldn't help me again. Received my FIFTH case number between all these interactions.
7. Finally got to someone who gave me yet ANOTHER case number and said my issue would be escalated and I'd be contacted within 2-3 days.

Six Days later, I missed the call from Support and called back on the number they provided: 1.866 606 3400
8. Sat on hold for 62 minutes this morning = no answer, I had to drop off to actually do my own job and attend a meeting.
9. Sat on hold again for 106 minutes = no answer, I had to drop off again.
10. I received an email survey as if my case is closed, when nothing has been resolved. What?!?
11. I'm still unresolved in my issue.

Also every time I talk to someone new I have to completely repeat myself and the issue experienced. Must be why I get a new case number each time because they don't share information.

SUPPORT SUCKS!!

Plus 1-star, because if you never have to contact support then the product worked well enough for me.
When I tried to install the software, it first tried to gather info from my hard disk and continued to do so unsuccessfully until I had to force it to quit.  Several more times the software failed to install.  When I contacted H&R's polite support staff after hours of frustration, I was emailed a corrected version of the software which did install correctly.  However, my success at installing the software was fleeting:  A couple of days later when I started up the software to continue to work on my taxes, the software indicated I must update my current installed version.  When I tried to do the update, I again experienced the same problem I had initially experienced--the H&R update tried to unsuccessfully to gather info on my hard drive.  There appears to be a re-occurring problem with H&R software installation.  The installation appears to go into an endless loop.  As much as I wanted to use H&R software and appreciated the efforts of its support staff, the software and its updates would not install on my computer despite many wasted hours of repeated attempts. Also, I spent a couple of hours on the the phone dialing, re-dialing, and talking with H&R's nice support staff without success.  I gave up.  What a shame.  I have used other companies' software and have not experienced any problems.
After several hours, I am still unable to download the software.  Amazon Customer Service just advised that after you purchase the product and click the download button, it may take "up to 4 hours" for the download to start.  Four hours?  She also advised that everything has been cleared and that the file can now be downloaded.  Tried again and I still cannot get this download to start.  I even clicked the back button and clicked the same purchase button again.  I thought that might start the process again and get by whatever was hanging up on Amazon's end.  Instead, Amazon charged me a 2nd time for the same software.  So now I'm double-charged for this purchase and can't even get the software once.  On this, the rep told me she will "make an exception to our no-return policy" and give me a refund for the 2nd purchase.  OK, I see.  This whole thing has been my fault but they will cut me a break this time.

I'm a big supporter of Amazon, but they're not ready for prime time when it comes to digital files.  I had a similar problem with their MP3's.  Most of the downloads worked out OK, but when I had a problem with three of them, the customer rep told me to go back and download them again.  They said, "...don't worry, I assure you won't be charged for the MP3's again."  Of course, they did charge me again.  I wrote back once, but nothing was done.  For $3, it wasn't worth pursuing any further.  I just need to get my digital stuff elsewhere.  If you decide to go for this, I hope your experience is better than mine.

After I have removed some previously entered Schedule D transactions it still prints security name on the printed forms. The same forms printed "not for filing" or displayed on the screen do not have these records, so there is no way to remove this garbage.
 Investors/Traders who have wash sales should consider TurboTax Deluxe rather then TaxCut Platinum.
 Product integration with GainsKeeper is incomplete. TaxCut is unable to import Wash Sales from GK. Transactions, which do not result in wash sales, are imported correctly.
I have asked TaxCut customer support regarding integration with GainsKeeper. Contrary to product specification they responded that TaxCut can import data only from Quicken/MS Money, but not GK. Response to my other technical question about arranging schedule D transactions in particular order was even more useless...

Not organized as well as TurboTax, poor wording for some steps, confusing instructions.  Very poor integration of state forms.

For several years up to 2002, I used TurboTax from Intuit - both the business and personal editions. Using TurboTax has been a pretty sucky semi-manual process that I've never been happy with. Believing some erroneous reviews (thanks for nothing Walt Mossberg from the WSJ), I vented my frustration by using TaxCut this year. It is horrific. It probably would have been easier to do my business returns by hand (even with having to look up calculations for depreciation). The other reviews cover most of the probs: it starts with trying to update the program and having it crash, continues through worksheets where you have to manually enter info that has already been entered elsewhere and a completely unintegrated (nonexistent?) help system, and ends where I had to go to the IRS and CA FTB sites to find the addresses to mail the reurns to.

it is 2015 I do not need an old obsolete edition
Hard to use inaccurate, online help is nonexistent. Use TurboTax even if you have to pay extra for it.
Well, it worked for me, but I am really annoyed by the high extra charge for a State return (I did not need one), H&R's attempt to refund my tax over payment with Gift Cards (almost could not determine how to avoid this trap), and the huge electronic payment charge if you need to pay! Will corporate greed even stop expanding ?
I have never had an issue with Amazon until this horrific purchase ...The download is unable to complete the software update ...moreover, no H&R Block Service to respond...no refund.
I thought it was a better deal at the time than TurboTax, but since that time Intuit made up for their greed.  This software is not as user friendly, I would not buy it again or recommend it to anyone.
This program was obsolete! it was a waste of time! I tried over and over to get it to work. then called H&R block and down loaded a new version this has happened 2 years in a row! I will never use H&R block again!
I ended up going to an accountant and found that the product really screwed me over - to the tune of about $3000! It simply does not have the right questions if you have any complexity to your finances. If you aren't sure, believe me the extra $130 I ended up paying my tax accountant was well worth the investment!!!
The individual program seems to be OK but the business program sucks.  I prepared a partnership return and a trust return. Both produced diagnostic errors that were not errors and there was no way to clear them. Customer service is nonexistent.

This review is for TaxCut 2007 Premium Federal on CD for Windows XP SP2.

I've been a user of TaxCut since tax year 2004. The tax part of TaxCut 2007 seems to work OK. I had problems with the installation and update of TaxCut 2007. Specifically, the TaxCut 2007 installation and update features modify the list of users who can access the \Program Files folder limiting it to only the Administrator who can access this folder. This effectively denies all other users on the XP system access to this folder, which means that ordinary users will have problems executing programs under this folder (which effectively is most installed programs). It also implies that only the Administrator can execute TaxCut.

I was able to fix this issue by looking at another XP system and modifying the access control list (ACL) of the \Program Files folder on the TaxCut system to match the other computer's ACL. Although this restored the system back to normal, TaxCut 2007 still only worked for an administrator, not an ordinary user. I've contacted TaxCut about the \Program Files folder problem. They said that they are looking into it.

This problem occurred when I installed TaxCut. It also occurred on the recent (Jan 10, 2008) update, which I installed on Jan 13, 2008.

I've had the same issues described by others with access to TaxCut '07 from a non-admin account. Most significantly was the issue with security settings for my c:\program files directory being changed by the installation of TaxCut, resulting in the inability to run certain applications from non-admin accounts. Thankfully I have enough "geek" in me to go in and undo that damage, but pity the poor, average user who does not. Even with the security accesses restored, TaxCut will still not run from a non-admin login.

I've used TaxCut for several seasons prior and have been very satisfied, but with the '07 version ... not so much.

There are two bugs that affect H&R Block At Home 2009 for some Apple Mac users.  Since both problems prevent customers from updating the program from the H&R Block web servers, customers must correct both problems manually before any updates from H&R Block are possible.

Who it affects: Mac customers who both: 1) have multiple login accounts on the Mac and 2) attempt to run H&R Block At Home 2009 from a non-admin account.

Problem #1: During the installation process the initial update fails due to file permissions.  Error message is: "1008:5,-5000 Access denied error.  You do not have enough access privileges for this installation"

Resolution: 1) Stop the program installation and log in under the admin account, 2) open a Finder window, 3) open the Applications folder, 4) uninstall the H&R Block 2009 program by dragging the icon to the Trash, 5) in the Finder window open the Utilities folder, 6) run the Disk Utility program, 7) select your hard drive as the disk upon which to operate, 8) click on the "Repair Disk Permissions" button and wait for that process to complete, 9) reinstall the H&R Block 2009 program under the admin account.

Problem #2: When running H&R Block 2009 using a non-admin login account, the program crashes immediately upon launch due to file permissions.  Error message is: "Initialization Failed. Exception thrown during initialization: File open failed. File = /Users/Shared/H&R Block/2009/update.tim in open:MacFileWriterImpl"

Resolution: 1) Exit the program and log in under the admin account, 2) open a Finder window, 3) open the Macintosh HD icon, 4) open the Users folder, then the Shared folder, then the H&R Block folder, 5) right-click on the 2009 folder, 6) select "Get Info" on the menu, 7) on the pop-up window in the "Sharing & Permissions" section set ALL permissions that say "Read Only" to instead say "Read & Write", 8) return to the Finder window and open the 2009 folder, 9) right-click on the update.tim file, 10) select "Get Info" on the menu, 11) on the pop-up window in the "Sharing & Permissions" section set ALL permissions that say "Read Only" to instead say "Read & Write".

Upon successful resolution of both of these problems the customer will be able to run H&R Block 2009 from a non-admin account to do their taxes.  As of the date of this note however (1/22/2010) all program updates must still be made using the admin account.

I discovered and diagnosed this on my own machine.  Fortunately I'm a geek and so was able to figure out the problem & share it with others.  Obviously H&R Block did not test this scenario before they shipped the program.  Dunno if a similar problems exists on Windows machines.  Also dunno if there will be further problems when I download & install the State program.  I haven't gotten that far yet.

UPDATE Problem #3: I installed the Maryland state program tonight (1/27) when it became available for download.  Given the problems above I used the admin account to do the install and then switched back to my normal account.  Ran the program: no Maryland state tax program installed!  And you're only allowed to download it one time without paying again!  Turns out the state program downloads into the directory ~/Library/Application Support/H&RBlock/2009/ (for non-techies ~ means starting at your home directory) and a non-shared plugin is created.  This thwarts other accounts from using the state program.

Resolution: Using a Finder window in the admin account copy the file ~/Library/Application Support/H&RBlock/2009/Completed Updates/md.dmg (for other states replace md.dmg with your state's abbreviation e.g. va.dmg for Virginia.)  Paste this into a shared directory such as Macintosh HD/Users/Shared.  Go back into your normal account and copy that same file from the Shared directory into your own ~/Library/Application Support/H&RBlock/2009/Completed Updates/ directory.  Double click on that file (md.dmg in my case.)  A new window will pop up and you'll see a new file which starts with your state's two-letter abbreviation.  In my case it was called MD.TCstate09.  Double click on that file.  Another window will pop up which says it is installing the state plug-in.  After that, you'll be able to use the state program under your normal user account as you intended.

Don't ask me how to update all of this mess at this point when H&R Block is ready to push out new program updates.  Do you use the admin account?  The user account?  Who knows?  It might even depend upon whether you are updating the Federal or the State return.  What a mess!

H&R Block really blew it this year on multi-user account support, at least on the Macs.  I tried relaying this to their Customer Service (3 phone calls and 2 online Chat sessions) but they had no one who understood the Macs and no way for me to email to them my diagnosis and solutions.  They were nice and tried to be helpful but I'm not sure they got exactly what I was saying.  I hope so though.

I have liked H&R Block in the past and they are cheaper than TurboTax.  This year, however, makes it difficult to remain a loyal customer.  We'll see what I do in tax year 2010.

Anyway, I hope my pain is able to help other Mac users get up and running.

Don't ask me how to update all of this mess at this point when H&R Block is ready to push out new program updates.  Do you use the admin account?  The user account?  Who knows?  It might even depend upon whether you are updating the Federal or the State return.  What a mess!

H&R Block really blew it this year on multi-user account support, at least on the Macs.  I tried relaying this to their Customer Service (3 phone calls and 2 online Chat sessions) but they had no one who understood the Macs and no way for me to email to them my diagnosis and solutions.  They were nice and tried to be helpful but I'm not sure they got exactly what I was saying.  I hope so though.

I have liked H&R Block in the past and they are cheaper than TurboTax.  This year, however, makes it difficult to remain a loyal customer.  We'll see what I do in tax year 2010.

Anyway, I hope my pain is able to help other Mac users get up and running.
I've used H&R Block TaxCut (now H&R Block At Home) in the past and have been very satisfied.  However this year I had two serious permission problems on the Mac.  Fortunately I'm a geek and so was able to figure out solutions.

The problem is only likely to crop up if you have multiple user accounts on the Mac, and use a non-Admin account to run the H&R Block At Home software.  Otherwise, if you're running with full Admin (root) privileges these bugs should not arise.

The first problem came right after I installed the program and it tried to do its initial update.  It failed with the following error messages: "1008:5,-5000 Access denied error" and "You do not have enough access privileges for this installation".  I had been running as a standard user so I switched to the Admin account, but to no avail.  I even tried running Mac's Disk Utility program and did a Repair Disk Permissions with no success.  I had to delete the program, re-run Disk Utility -> Repair Disk Permissions with the program gone, then reinstall the program as Admin.  Then and only then would it do a program update and continue on.

However, for security reasons I don't like to run as Admin, so I went back to my standard user account at that point.  Then the second problem came up.  When I tried to start the program as a normal user I got the following error message: "Initialization Failed.  Exception thrown during initialization: File open failed.  File = /Users/Shared/H&R Block/2009/update.tim in open:MacFileWriterImpl".  After puzzling over that for a bit I realized what was wrong and confirmed it by dropping down into the underlying Unix OS underneath Mac OS X.  And that is, H&R Block has the permissions set wrong for the file specified above and for the folder (or directory) containing that file.  Sure enough, an ls -l in Unix confirmed that the permissions on that directory do not grant write access to anyone other than the owner of the file & directory. For those of us who create multiple accounts on the Mac, and who installed the program using the Admin account, mere mortal user accounts will not be able to modify that file.  (And I suspect the file keeps track of the last update attempt, which normally occurs immediately upon program initialization, which is why it crashes the program right away.)

So the fastest way for me to fix the problem was to go back to the Admin account, open up a Unix window using Mac's Terminal utility, change directories (cd) down to the 2009 directory, and reset the permissions with "chmod go+w 2009" "cd 2009" and "chmod go+w update.tim" for the file as well.  Then everyone (group and other) can write to the file.  Went back to the standard user and - well of course it worked!

Those two solutions should help those of you who are comfortable with a bit of the techie side of Mac OS and/or Unix.  However for the others, this is clearly a permissions bug in the H&R Block At Home software which I hope they get pushed out to their customers quickly.  However they'll have to walk their customers through it verbally, since unless you can update the program online, you can't install the patches to fix the installation & update bugs.  I called technical support tonight and reported the problem, cause, and solution, so hopefully their Customer Support call centers will be able to help other customers.

I'd love to give the program more stars, but I fear these two permission bugs are going to cause a lot of grief to a lot of H&R Block customers who own Apple computers.  Hopefully however this will help some folks get up and running.

Three updates since I originally posted this review:

1) I should have provided instructions to users to fix the permissions using non-Unix commands.  So here goes using the Apple Mac OS X interface: a) sign on as Admin, b) open a Finder window and navigate down to /Users/Shared/H&R Block, c) right-click on the 2009 folder, d) select "Get Info" on the menu, e) on the pop-up window in the "Sharing & Permissions" section set ALL permissions that say "Read Only" to instead say "Read & Write", e) navigate into the 2009 folder and repeat the permission change instructions for the update.tim file.  You're done & now your standard user account can run H&R Block At Home.

2) H&R Block pushed out an update tonight (1/21/2010).  As an experiment I tried updating the program from my standard user account.  It ran to completion with no errors however after finishing told me that I still had that same update that needed to be done ... which means it didn't update the files on disk after all.  So the permission bugs persist, at least for now.  You'll have to perform all updates using the Admin superuser account (that worked) but if you do that you can at least run the program as a normal user.

3) I installed the Maryland state program tonight (1/27) when it became available for download.  Given the problems above I used the admin account to do the install and then switched back to my normal account.  Ran the program: no Maryland state tax program installed!  And you're only allowed to download it one time without paying again!  Turns out the state program downloads into the directory ~/Library/Application Support/H&RBlock/2009/ (for non-techies ~ means starting at your home directory) and a non-shared plugin is created.  This thwarts other accounts from using the state program.

Resolution: Using a Finder window in the admin account copy the file ~/Library/Application Support/H&RBlock/2009/Completed Updates/md.dmg (for other states replace md.dmg with your state's abbreviation e.g. va.dmg for Virginia.)  Paste this into a shared directory such as Macintosh HD/Users/Shared.  Go back into your normal account and copy that same file from the Shared directory into your own ~/Library/Application Support/H&RBlock/2009/Completed Updates/ directory.  Double click on that file (md.dmg in my case.)  A new window will pop up and you'll see a new file which starts with your state's two-letter abbreviation.  In my case it was called MD.TCstate09.  Double click on that file.  Another window will pop up which says it is installing the state plug-in.  After that, you'll be able to use the state program under your normal user account as you intended.

Don't ask me how to update all of this mess at this point when H&R Block is ready to push out new program updates.  Do you use the admin account?  The user account?  Who knows?  It might even depend upon whether you are updating the Federal or the State return.  What a mess!

The product should not be released to the consumer.  I found sections in the application that said it was for testing purposes only and would be removed before production.  Live update reports that I have the latest version.  In addition, I get abnormal termination errors.  My system is very well maintained and I do NOT get errors with any other applications.
Would you thrust your taxes to such an application?

I just downloaded this from Amazon, and so far it is pretty lame.  Firstly, no activation code.  Went to online chat and was 145 in the queue!!  Feeble...
used TurboTax last year and went smoothly.  Read about C-Dilla on Turbotax last year (which they dropped subsequently), got ticked off, so tried Tax Cut.  Just awful in comparison.  Unlike Turbotax, you can't view the forms, and you cant easily make changes to inputed items.  I tried figuring NY state tax and for some reason it didn't pick up the city taxes withheld even though it was entered.  And you cant print to a PDF file (so i can take to my office and print on laser printer), can only only hard-print, and no way to review the form before you do! Miserable.  Going to order TurboTax today and never go back to H&R Blockhead Tax Cut.

FAIL  Ive used H&R Block Software for a number of years but this will likely be my last.  This year I needed to file multiple state returns (NY, NJ & SC).  In NY and NJ I needed to file jointly with a deceased spouse (filing as a surviving spouse).  Unfortunately after completing both state returns, and dropping $42.75 on each additional state program, the software informed me that it could not handle e-filing when filing as a surviving spouse.  That especially ticked me off because NYs e-file is a free service per state law.  Then to make matters even better the SC State software has a serious flaw in Schedule NR line 46.  Basically it adds the values in Part II and Part III to the value in Part I, when it should be subtracting them.  So far I spent about 6 hours finding the issue and explaining and re-explaining and re-re-explaining the issue to tech support.  My goal being to get Block to push a software update for the SC software but no luck yet!  So here I sit out 145 bucks for software to e-file a federal return.
Software would not load on computer.  I subsequently purchased the same software at a retail store and had no problems.
H&R Block 2014 Dlx with State dropped the ball this time! I encountered at least one VERY NOTICEABLE bug which I reported. The bug was subsequently fixed in about a week in a roundabout way. I do not have faith in the product. Suggestion: Manually double check all steps/figures.

** Use the software at your own risks **
The SC state version was useless.  I'm going to print blank forms and do them manually.  Never again will I buy this product.
BEWARE. After filling in my entire federal 1065 form, I allowed the software to "update". Subsequently, it will not start due to missing file and I must reinstall.
so so
Eh...

Just finished using TaxCut Standard 2002 Federal. Absolutely awful as compared to TurboTax. Many questions and statements in the interview are ambiguous. The navigation through the program is good, but TurboTax did a better job of helping you categorize some entries. In many cases, TaxCut defaults to IRS tax guide language, which is sketchy, at best. For example, under itemized deductions, TaxCut uses standard government language for the various item categories, including the nebuluous "other." TurboTax uses more familiar categories, distinguishing such items as "software," an item TaxCut does not recognize. Also downloaded TaxCut State 2002 for Georgia. Georgia has not adopted the Federal Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002 that allows you to take a bonus depreciation on certain types of property. The bonus must be excluded on the Georgia return (and in many other states.) TaxCut leaves you hanging on this issue, tells you to get the Georgia forms and rework the depreciation for Georgia manually. I gave up at that point and bought TurboTax. TurboTax accounted for all of the state and federal law differences automatically and, it also filled out all of the additional state forms without prompting. One last problem with TaxCut. If you elect to use the integral electronic filing system, it balks at "too many ___ forms" "too many entries per ____ form" and "wrong punctuation on line ____," etc. TurboTax did the electronic filing without a hitch.

I found in using the Delux version that a form was missing, 8582 CR which is needed to establish whether a specific content of Form 8582, namely, a tax credit would be allowed and yet the latter form was available.  The state version (CA) also had forms missing, namely, forms for reporting installment sales. These forms are all available in the largest selling tax prep program, TurboTax.  I was also very displeased with the fact that you cannot print out a listing of interest or dividend sources for inclusion in the return to support the numbers in Sched B without the following printed on the form in bold and large letters "Not For Filing". Their were other problems with the listing. I contacted the company re' the missing forms. Their reply was for me to get the forms from the government but they also pointed out that then the return could no longer be submitted electronically.  Their money back guarantee is also a laugh since they require the inclusion of the originalbar code from the box.  But in my case, I had alredy sent this in for a rebate. I suggest you buy TurboTax.

Last year, a bug in TaxCut caused by W2 to be entered twice in an e-filed return. Instead of getting a healthy refund, the IRS thought I owed them several thousand dollars in back taxes, penalty, and interest. Speaking of interest, HR Block showed NO interest in helping me with the problem that their bugware caused. It took me several months, several nasty letters from the IRS, and a long stream additional forms (not supported by TaxCut) to get the TaxCut problems straightened out.

I'm giving this product one star only because I can't give it zero. I heartily advise you to do whatever you need to do to avoid this product and this company. Use TurboTax, calculate by hand, or hire a CPA, but do NOT trust TaxCut.

H&R Block refused to honor my refund bonus.  You're supposed to get gift cards totaling your IRS refund (or however much of your refund you specify) plus 10 percent.  So, for example, if you sign up to devote $1000 of your refund to the bonus program, they are supposed to give you $1100 in gift cards.

The catch is that if the IRS reduces your refund for any reason, they reduce your gift cards by the amount of the reduction.  If the reduction is greater than the amount of gift cards you signed up for, then you get nothing.  That's True even if you still have plenty of refund remaining to cover the gift cards.

So beware.
Awful.  After completing my return, the program indicated I am ready to file.  It also indicated a huge refund was due to me from New York State.  I knew this could not be correct, so delved into the forms, and saw that although the NYS program included my New York City taxes in the amount I paid through withholding, it did not calculate the New York City taxes I owed.  Therefore, the program calculated all New York City taxes I paid through withholding as overpayment.  If I had filed as the program was ready to have me file, there would have been serious problems.
This product is a mess!!!  If you file by paper in California, you will need the new Schedule W-2 CG form, which is not included in TaxCut State for California or the California Franchised Tax Board website.  A Schedule W-2, non-CG version is availabe on the website, but it cannot be used if you file using a program such as TaxCut which generates what they called "scannable" returns.  The "scannable" returns must go with "Schedule W-2 CG" and not "Schedule W-2".  Since TaxCut does not provide it, you are screwed...  TurboTax is a little buggy around this area too, HOWEVER, TurboTax can print the blank Schedule W-2 CG, which is all you need...

Kafka anyone?  when you down load you are supposed to receive an activation code s you can complete the filing and send it in.  so far, have not received.  also when I attempted to contact HR Block about it they changed the security question from what school I attended in the 6th grade to what street I lived on in the 6th grade.  Huh?
In Taxcut website customer surport page, they claim the valid range for an ITIN is ***-70_*** to ***-80-***. However, the IRS website publishes the range as ***-70-*** to ***-88-***. This out-of-date info in Taxcut software is preventing people (with ITIN range between ***-81-*** and ***-88-***) from e-filing the tax returns. I called Taxcut twice, and pointed out this problem, but the support people were either too ignorant of the ITIN number and software update routines, or just gave me some wierd unhelpful solutions, such as delete the number, close the software, wait for 5 minutes, then try again. I am having little hope that Taxcut will fix this problem this year, and I can only do a paper-filing now even though I paid for the version with e-file included. Also, thinking of all the trouble I have to go through to get a refund, I don't even want to bother.
