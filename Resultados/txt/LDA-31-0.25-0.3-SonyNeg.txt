You know, pirates are all about sailing the seven seas, scourging and plundering mercilessly to retrieve your loot and stab your trusted officers in the back when orders are not fufilled. But Pirates: The Legened of Black Kat is anything but what you thought a pirate game should be.First off, the only real highlight of this game is being the captian of many ships and buying repair and weapon items. But even sailing them and doing sea battles is not that challenging and not that fun.You can also dock on many islands and many worlds as Katrina de' Leon, but even that is exceptionly bad. She does not have many moves or abilityes and heck, she can't even climb up the smallest hills!Graphics on this game are very poor, and all of the villians and chest items you retrive look horrible. The only good graphics of the game are the waters of the oceans you sail which look very real.The music is alright...when it decides to turn itself on. One of this games' many flaws is that it gives you no motivation to keep "adventuring" while you play and you don't feel like you ever want to plug it in after your done playing!However, there are little aspects of this game that seem interesting but not enough to keep you from being bored, such as Tiki Heads which give you different attacks, and magical figureheads on your ship to give it powers out of the ordinary. Yet even these items do very little to keep you wanting to play.Mostly, I kept wanting to see more variety of gameplay and challenges, as it quickly got repetitive, and the puzzles on this game are quick to solve.All in all, if you like horrible, poorly desighned laking gameplay in a video game, I sugest that you don't even glance at this game next time you come across it.It just plain is'nt worth it.

This game was'nt fun for me at all.  It was to hard riding the bike and it's just a boring game overall.  Planing to trade it in for beowulf.
This game isn't any better than the sims i own both games and the only thing thats differnt from the sims and the sims busten out is the story line and that you watch you drive your vehicle i men how gay is that?I mean i don't know why they called this game sims bustin out i mean i dont even know why they wasted there time makeing this one.I sugest if you want to start with sims wait and get the sims 2.

But it is a very bad game. The story is barley there,you pick a hero/villian and fight 7 people. Thats about it, there is a little paragraph tellin you about your enemy like what he/she is doing and who they work for. The sound is decent pretty low quality but it is'nt completely terrible, the only saving grace is the graphics, while cool it doesnt save the game and, as much as i was hoping for a good game this one falls flat.

Cheap Chinese POS don't buy this knock off, the thumb sticks squeak loudly and it weighs 11oz less then the real one. I tore this apart after it broke in 2 weeks and nothing was salvageable. I tossed this in the fire pit. Don't waste your money on crap that is probably full of lead. Screw you china

First off, this game features the most downright ugly hero you'll ever see.The controls are sluggish and annoying. 'Ammond runs like a Thunderbirds puppet and it becomes a feat in itself to simply move about.Can't run and shoot. Very innovative. When you stand still, the baddies shoot you. Go figure.In this realistic game, our gormless hero can't open doors, jump over foot-high blockades (or jump at all) and recovers from shotgun blasts to the face by leaning against walls.The game isn't 'fun' in the same way GTA is- the car chase bits are deathly dull, due to the fact that you'll crash into a car or pole every ten seconds. The cops can't pull you out of your car either, so it's more of an endurance test than a challenge, just keep ploughing along.The regular cars barely move at all, only the Lexuses and sportscars are worth jacking.No camera angles in the car sections, so mission briefs like "Bring the triads to our HQ, and make sure that they follow you" are nonsensical as you cant look behind you. No onscreen maps or info either. Or ammo counts for that matter.Everything is so big on the screen- compare the feeling of space that you have around you in GTA with this. In GTA, traffic and baddies can be seen approaching, whereas in this they appear right on you.Again, the 'lean-against-a-wall-to-gain-energy' system. Even the non playable characters comment that you're standing around like an idiot. Sorry love, can't help it.Glitchy graphics. A friend of mine encountered a horde of giants in Hyde Park who shrunk to midgets once neared. Is perspective reversal common in the UK?Negotiating stairwells cause 'Ammond to perform a very camp jig. Can't the man just bound up them with dignity?And so on and so on...

Legendary basketball player Shaquille O'Neil is in Tokyo as he goes into a Chinese store where an old man whisks you away into another dimension where you must combat enemies like a cat-lady, a mummy and other baddies.One of the worst games of all time! this game is a complete disaster that i remembered thinking the game has an odd yet wacky concept as it has to be fun and rented it from one of my local video stores. The music is ok and the graphics are cartoony but this game has lousy controls that feel like they have been busted, you keep getting killed without a fair chance.No wonder this has been a waste of rental money for those that rented it, in fact there is a site that is dedicated to destroying this horrible abomination of a game. It's as bad as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, X-Men for NES and E.T. for Atari.

It's a great game, but when you get everything, you realize that there's nothing to do on it anymore. It's not even fun building realtionships, getting jobs, getting promoted, and winning Drius's penthouse. I RECOMMEND THE SIMS BUSTIN OUT IT IS THE SEXIEST GAMMA EVA

What a fun game this may have been if it actually was able to play, Sadly this was a dud & would not play, so I got issued a refund & tossed the disc. I would not order from seller again!

Prepare yourself for this game. It's not what you think.I had read all the ballyhoo about it and it was perhaps my heightened expectations that ultimately let me down when I first started playing it.First of all, it's pretty much the same game. The core values are the same, the way it works is the same; not much has changed from 3000 to SC4.Yes it's prettier graphically ... I like to equate it to the changeover from Windows 3.1 to 95 -- but only on a visual level. The add-on functions of SC4 are pretty slim. The game playing changes unnoticeable.One of the &quot;changes&quot; is the importation of your SIMS from The SIMS. Before I purchased this game I had visions of watching my imported SIMS walk into stores (like in Hot Date) in SC4 and see them go about their daily lives, but on a much bigger scale -- a whole growing city.Be warned, this is not the case at all. You import your SIMS, they live in a neighborhood and then proceed to bug the hell out of you about various things they're thinking. Import one and he's a chatterbox. Import the six they offer and it's a veritable zoo. You know how annoying pop-up ads are on the Internet? Think that. It's about the same.Don't even think about installing pipes in your city. They'll spring a leak every two seconds (even if you have water utilities fully funded) and destroy surrounding neighborhood housing.Fully funded police stations are lazy. You have to direct them to the crimes and have them pick up the criminals. There's no patrolling with these boys.Drop funding a tiny bit for the firestations and they're out protesting with picket signs. It's cute for the first five minutes.It seems that Maxis has forgotten what was attractive about its games in the first place and is now only after a buck. This trend started with the runaway smash hit that was The Sims and followed with (what? we're up to six?) upgrade packages -- all providing extras that should have been in their initial game in the first place -- or at the very least combined into one extra service package upgrade ... six is tantamount to exploitation of its consumer's wallets.The same goes with SC4. While it is prettier visually, it's not the blowout wunderkind game you're expecting. Get it only if you're a HUGE fan of SimCity, or if you've never played SimCity before ... otherwise, it'll likely let you down the same way it did with me.

Only a baffoon would not see this coming.  If it can't even handle Deus Ex 1 and Rainbow Six 3, what makes you think it's going to be able to run a halo clone.  Call up any psychic, they'll tell you the same thing I'm telling you.  Sattle up the syrup boys, we are headed to the flopzone.

BUYERS BEWARE:  Brett Favre is not in this game.  I got this game thinking Brett Favre was in it, but Brett Favre was not in it.  Also it was really hard to get the plastic wrap and stickers off the case.  Not happy.  At all.  Get the Madden with Brett Favre on the cover.
NHL 2004 shows some signs of being a quality game, but lacks far too much to actually achieve this. Some features were improved, others took a step backwards and the result is an average at best game that could have and should have been so much more.We'll start with the gameplay. The computer is able to use this incredible little &quot;Hold/Hook&quot; feature to get the puck from you at will. Last I checked Holding and Hooking were penalties, but the computer is hardly penalized for these infractions. Naturally you might think that turning around and hooking/holding them would be successful, but don't worry, the computer is able to skate right through hooks and holds. This leads to many frustrating encounters as the computer effortlessly strips you of the puck while you have to bash a computer guy through the glass to get the puck from him.The passing can also be frustrating, guys often cut or spontaneously change their direction after you fire off the pass. I thought I had finally got passing down, was getting 80-85% passing and then I was hit with a game in which I completed a whole 56% of passes. As far as I know I didn't change anything. The nature of the beast? At any rate, passing, while it isn't guarenteed anymore (that's good) is perhaps a bit too random now.The camera angles are also rather poor. I don't know why EA messed with it's cameras, but for any of the vertical camera angles the &quot;up&quot; net and the area behind the &quot;up&quot; net is impossible to find the puck in.The off-ice features are a mess as well. First of all, no more NHL Cards. OK, OK, so you never used them anyway right? But you could unlock stuff with certain cards and earning points to buy card packs was a nice extra element. Well all that is gone. Instead in NHL 2004 there is a menu option called &quot;Unlockables&quot;. Oh, how original. I believe it is tied in with your EA Sports Bio and periodically it pops up and gives you a new unlockable. Exciting, isn't it?Now how about that new Dynasty mode you ask yourself? Well, it's a start at a good mode but is riddled with problems. First of all is this upgrade stuff. You get your team in a crippled state, their facilities are horrible and you have to use upgrades to get them to average and then beyond. Until you do that's a big ol -10 OV to your players. But every other GM faces this problem too, so the playing field is level ... everyone just plays with slow 70-75 OV players until they get their facilities up.Of course, that'll take about 35 more upgrade points than you start with, so you'll need 3500 exp points. That'd be 350 trades or 1750 wins. Win a Stanley Cup or two along the way and it's probably only 500 wins.That's not the only problem either. Dynasty Mode conviently forgets to mention when players are injured and refuses to even give you an injury estimate. Perhaps this may be related to the medical upgrades, but I should still be able to know if he's in serious health trouble or not. The effect of back to back games on your players is also ridiculous, don't expect to win the back end of any back to backs: your players are literally pylons out there.The big effort of NHL 2004 seemed to go into its Dynasty Mode. This means the other features are very bare bones and you really must use Dynasty Mode to get anything worthwhile out of the game. Unforetunately, while Dynasty Mode had some good ideas the execution wasn't there. And sadly the gameplay certainly isn't about to &quot;hook or hold&quot; you in where the features fail (haha haha ha ...)The motto of NHL 2004: It had some good ideas, but the execution just wasn't there.

This is horrible.The player runs so slowly.There is no Care Packages.And NO EXTINCTION MODE!Don't buy this.... this is like COD for the elderly.
This game is a waste of time to play after you get to blacklist member #5 JV. In the milestone section where you have to hit 28 cop cars and then evade them you can't cause they either run you into walls, have too many cops on you or spiked roadblocks you don't know about until is too late.  According to my husband you have to play this game for more than 500 hours a day.
Before I begin let me state I am a very, very good video game racer. I've beaten or at least accomplished a lot on many racing games. I am very good. This game however is even too hard for me. The difficulty level is insane. The tracks are full of right angle turns, tricky s curves, hard to miss traffic, and drivers you compete against that are absoutely brutal. The sponsor races are near impossible for anybody without driving skill nearing that of godly.I was warned before I bought this game that it can make people who never get mad at games extremely enraged. I was even shown a photo of what somebody did to a PS2 controller. However, I just figured that was those people's character fault and got this game anyway with the mindset I would not give into getting mad. Well, after trying 15 or so times to beat the SAME race I was so angry that I started smashing the controller over my head as hard as I could! And what I did to myself after that to relive the extreme stress I am probably not allowed to talk about on here so I will leave it out. But I really hurt myself and it left me emotionally scarred. For like two weeks after I stopped playing the game I was extremely short fused with people and freaking out and SCREAMING AND YELLING AND BREAKING THINGS every time some little thing went wrong in my life. And I am never like this. I had just lost my ability to handle stress.Oh, I should also mention, that unless you win a race you get nothing, absoutely nothing. Unlike Burnout 3 you do not get any points you won unless you win the race. Had a really insane drift that earned you like 1,500 reputation points? Well if you lose the race too bad you aren't getting it.So unless your racing skill borders on the divine, and unless you could compete against the best video game racers in the country and likely win, this is not the game for you.

Despite the highly impressive introductory scene and menu screen, don't be deceived.  This game is far too conventional and undeniably sloppy.  Terrible low quality graphics and messy animation, lifeless paper diorama-like environments, corny cliched looped background 'noise' which fails to evoke a dark, haunting atmosphere.  The controls can become extremely confusing and frustrating in times of crisis (plenty of mutilation, blood spillage and cleavage wobbling though).  The characters are in many ways stereotyped and dull yet cheaply sexy and appealing (in the busty exotic bombshell type way - a cross between Elvira and Mortal Kombat's Sonya Blade).The concept and storyline (or lack of) is shallow and focuses more on show-casing stereotypical gothic style, lacking substance and depth.It's a shame, this game potentially could've been much better.  It certainly doesn't do justice for the X-box either...  It's still an appealing short-lasting novelty like playing old platformers for nostalgic value.  It's fun and wasteful but certainly not for those who want a worthwhile challenge.

Well Level 5 had to start somewhere. So they gave us this... a blend of a roguelike dungeon crawler and Soul Blazer town rejuvenating. This game has its charms, and in the beginning is actually kind of fun. Crafting your own weapons and designing the town layouts are the strongest highlights. However, about midway through the charm wears off, and the formula becomes all too tedious. Basically Level 5 took what should be a 12 hour game and used time wasting methods to stretch that out to 30 hours. To see things through to the end, you'll need a mountain of patience and a bit of a masochistic streak (especially for the last boss). Supposedly Dark Cloud 2 (AKA Dark Chronicle) fixes all the problems this game has. So I would suggest skipping this one and going straight to its sequel instead.

Ummm... no thanks. I don't care HOW pretty it is, I, as well as just about every EQ player I know (and I know many of them) all agree: The timesinks stop at EQ1. There will be no starting over for any reason. We've all invested too much time on EQ1 to just drop it and move forward, especially with Sony's infamously horrific customer service.I am a paying beta tester for Everquest (in my opinion that game still hasn't left beta, and since I pay to play it, well, that makes me a paid beta tester doesn't it hehe). I will not pay Sony for the privaledge of testing their new game.IF Sony was smart, they would make Everquest II a complete rewrite of EQ1 with this fabled new engine of theirs and allow people to import the characters into it that they have worked so incredibly hard on.EQ2 is going to be a total loser, mark my words--regardless of it's prettiness or features. It will be another Anarchy Online, UO2 (ummm WHAT UO2? heh), Dark Ages of Camelot, etc. It simply will never reach critical mass because EQ1 players will NOT switch in droves like they are hoping.Sony is crazy to make EQ2 incompatible with EQ1. Not smart at all.It truly seems that the "soul" of Verant has left the building, in a big way, since their acquisition.
Ummm... no thanks. I don't care HOW pretty it is, I, as well as just about every EQ player I know (and I know many of them) all agree: The timesinks stop at EQ1. There will be no starting over for any reason.

Was very much looking forward to this game,unfortunately it falls flat. Cute yes,but dull gameplay.DULL!!!!monotonous, repetitive, uneventful,insipid, uninteresting, unexciting,uninspiring, unstimulating, jejune,flat, stale, tired, banal, lackluster,stodgy, vapid, mind-numbingand wearisome...Odd how such an imaginative lookinggame can have such unimaginative play.
This is the buggiest game I've ever purchased, and it does not stand up to EA Games shining (but rapidly fading) history.  For example:  I've been stuck on a rooftop early in the game covering some guy name Klaus while he picks the lock on a door.  Meanwhile, Nazis are coming out of the woodwork.  After about the 10th try, he finally opens the door and we go to the bottom of the stairs where . . . nothing happens.  The game is stuck.  I cannot walk past him, and he just stands there.  I go back outside and nothing happens for several minutes.  Eventually the Nazis show back up and I run out of ammo.  This makes no sense because we supposedly on a covert mission, and we should be running away once through the door.In addition, the graphics engine is severely showing its age, and overall the gameplay, AI, etc. is way behind.

Before playing this game you should play the preceding title of the series "The Mark of Kri" which is a truly fantastic game. It introduces a beautiful atmospheric world, unique controls, great action, and an interesting story. One of the best title's I've played for the PS2.That said, I have a bone or two to pick with the sequel here. I really wanted to give this game a shining review but I have to be honest with you. For the record I found this game to be quite beautiful like MoK and the controls were very much alike. I became accustomed to fighting alongside a computer controlled ally and learned to like it. I played as the new characters and came to like them too.The painful things about this game are the bugs/glitches! I've played a lot of PS2 titles, I can safely say that even among the worst titles I've played, none of them had this many bugs. What happened Sony? Did you pull the plug on this one and rush it to store shelves? Here's a list of bugs I have experienced commonly in this game:1. In stealth mode, half the time, enemies somehow magically see you when you're completely concealed around a corner.2. Floors disappear and stay gone during play, and make you appear as if you are walking on air. Sounds cool but it isn't. It's sloppy.3. Sometimes when you flip a switch and you computer ally attempts to flip it too, door jam closed instead of opening for you.4. Your character gets stuck in a wall sometimes permanently.5. When attempting to complete level challenges such as completing certain combos on enemies, the correctly and successfully performed combos will go undetected after dozens of attempts. (this one really irks me)6. You computer controlled partner freezes in place7. The entire game freezes.It's heartbreaking really. I love the series and the story but I can't help but get really frustrated at the sloppy programming behind this game. I expect more from Sony, especially since MoK was such a wonderful game. Try it at the very least.

This game is regularly voted as one of the worst video games of all time (if not THE worst), and I won't argue with that, but I think that the game is actually strangely fascinating. It's so bad it's actually comical! In fact, it's even almost like it was intended to be that way (although I'm sure it wasn't). The game has a storyline that makes minus zero sense. The way it starts is, Shaq is in Japan before a charity basketball game, and he comes to this karate dojo (by the way, there is a bit of prominent Pepsi product placement [how's that for alliteration?] here), where an old man informs him that he (Shaq, that is) is the Magic One, and that he (again, Shaq) must go into another dimension to rescue some kid named Nezu. Then Shaq goes through this portal into the other dimension. The story begs multitudinous questions, and never answers a single one (unless I've missed or forgotten something, or more than one thing). Some examples: Just why is Shaq (the "Magic One") the ONLY one who can rescue Nezu? Why can't anyone else do it? Why was Nezu kidnapped in the first place? Why is there a portal to the other dimension inside the dojo? How does the old man know that Shaq is the Magic One (that is, the one who must rescue Nezu)? This next question doesn't really have so much to do with the story, but just exactly how do you pronounce "Nezu"? ("NEZ-oo"? "NEE-zoo"? "NAY-zoo"?) If I tried to list all of the questions that the storyline (and other things in the game) make me ask, the list would probably go on for miles before I finished it! As for the actual "game" part, I really don't think that it looks or sounds that bad (although MANY other games, including other SNES games, have done MUCH better). I wouldn't say that the controls are that good, though. Your opponents are really bizarre --- a catlady, a mummy (who is the main bad guy), and assorted other weirdos. Before each match, you and your opponent engage in a bit of smack talking --- bad smack talking, at that. It seems that your opponents all have much better moves than you do; they can whip your butt in no time. I find it odd that Shaq has no basketball-related moves; shouldn't he at least have the ability to throw basketballs at his opponents? (By the way, get a load of the mummy guy's name: Sett Ra. Those who are familiar with ancient Egyptian deities, or at least their names, will probably get a laugh out of that.) And, for those of you who may not want the ending of the game spoiled, SKIP THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH!The game ends as ridiculously as it begins (almost). Shaq returns to Earth (with Nezu) in time for that charity basketball game --- and who is there at the game but Shaq's enemies from the other dimension (or at least a couple of them, anyway). Then Shaq dishes out a little more smack talk, and that's it.Overall, a supremely cheesy game. It really makes no sense that Shaq is even on the game. The game indeed appears to have been mainly just a cheap attempt to cash in on Shaq's (then-)celebrity, as he was very big at the time; making a truly good game (let alone one where Shaq's presence actually makes sense) doesn't seem to have been a priority. If you like games with storylines that make actual sense (any sense at all), this definitely isn't one of those games. If you like games that play really well, this isn't one of those games, either. But if you just want a game that is good for a few laughs (even if that was unintentional), this game might work for you, though it certainly isn't worth paying much for.

I expected so much from this title, but it suffers from the exact same problems as the first two MOH titles. They are as follows (in order of frustration level to me)Problem #1: Bullets come from absolutely nowhere... while this has been toned down since the "underground" installment, it is still very prevalent. Your enemies will shoot straight through buildings on occasion, and bullets will travel around corners as well.Problem #2: Every Nazi you come across is an absolute crackshot. I can sit there and watch an enemy through a thick fog in my sniper rifle scope from 200-300 yards sidestepping my crosshairs or running from side to side and hosing me down with a WWII-era STG40 automatic rifle (one of the most ridiculously inaccurate weapons ever made) with AT LEAST 70% accuracy at the same time- needless to say, this ends the level for me rather quickly. If I have a hard time sniping someone with a SNIPER RIFLE even though they are dead center in the crosshairs, they'd better suffer the same problem.Problem #3: Lt. Patterson is an IDIOT when it comes to weapons. He can squeeze the trigger, but aiming is another story. You should see "Operation Repunzel"- I am armed with a silenced pistol, getting hit from all different directions, and I can't hit a guy standing less than 3 feet away! The moron fires and a bullet hole appears in the wall behind him at least 45 degrees from the intended target. In short, it's ridiculous. A U.S. Army Lieutenant had to have been better trained in small-arms skill than this if he is to have survived WWII. Fortunately, he shoots quite well with a sniper rifle, but the machine guns and pistols are beyond frustrating.Problem #4: Realism. I never quite felt like I was executing a mission, but rather it seemed like a wild goose chase from medkit to medkit, absorbing dozens of bullets in my not-so-human body in between. This may have passed in the heyday of FPS's like DOOM, but today that stuff shouldn't cut it.Fellow gamers, is this what you think we should be getting from "the most realistic WWII shooter of all time?" Sure, the graphics, controls, and sound are great, but it lacks the flair where it really counts. Skip this one.

Where do I begin?  No, I'm not going to burst forth into a song of melodic melody.  I'll start with the first Crysis game.  Nomad was the main character of the game and he didn't die.  So what happened?  Why didn't he continue onto Crysis 2?Why?  Because the writers are a mass of unimaginative gunk....that's why.  There's no logic whatsoever in putting a character into play that wasn't the main character to begin with.  It's like starting a story with Superman and then in the next issue having Supergirl take over and not even mention Superman.  Or like dumping Drake from Uncharted: Drake's Fortune and having Sully or one of the girls continue the following stories.  That's how dislocated the Crysis series is.  The creators of Crysis are weak when it comes to continuing something--anything in a logical sequence.  It's beyond them.  They have no talent for it and should do us a favor a get out of storytelling.Nomad should have been the character brought back to Crysis 2.  But the fools brought back the Prophet character.No matter, even though it defies logic, he didn't take up much of the story especially since he blew his brains out.  As to Prophet continuing the jagged storyline instead of Nomad, I can safely say it was a great mistake.  And why does Prophet need the Marines to help him find Dr. Gould?  What kind of wimpy super soldier is this bogus creation?  There are not enough fingers to plug-up these bursting dams.Alcatraz (Crysis 2) is the new protagonist and the story is pretty good and has some sense to it, that is, until you come to the ending and a man that committed suicide once again takes over the body of Alcatraz or so I thought until Crysis 3.  The mere fact that Prophet regains his complete mind, body and soul is impossible.  Crytek believes that you and I are so low in our mindset that it didn't even cross their minds that they were feeding the gaming world left over fragments of bad brainstorming.  And if they did, it clearly reflects their lack of respect for the gaming public's ability to perceive a game full of worms.  For me, Prophet is dead.These writers are undeniably moronic or smoke a great deal of bad seaweed.  In Crysis 3 Prophet some how not only takes over the mind of Alcatraz's body but gets his body back!  What lowlife thought up this idea...this urine based tale for consumption?  I could not and would not accept this ridiculous impossibility and illogical story.  Alcatraz, to any normal non-seaweed smoking individual, should have continued to lead the way in Crysis 3.  Prophet is dead.Simply put, it's a stupid and unbelievable story.Nevertheless, if you ignore Cryteks ignorance in story writing, you can still have fun shooting;  but, fun factor in this game is not even close to Crysis 2....not only in story but in the soundtrack as well.  One thing that Crysis 2 had was an amazing soundtrack which was even better than the story itself.  Crysis 3--forget it--nothing--a flat and uninspiring soundtrack.  In fact I can't even remember a single sound byte from this terrible follow-up tale of miserable woe--woe in maniacal writing.In the end what has Crytek given us?  They've given us a trilogy of nonsensical and illogical stories that truly cannot be tied together in any believable or enjoyable way.Also, I expected the bow in Crysis 3 to be something stupendous and it wasn't.  "Bowhunter Edition," is a misnomer.  I forgot about this weapon during game play and only remembered it occasionally and usually, only, after I ran out of ammo for my other weapons--and sometimes I just resorted to the melee function to overcome opponents.  Overall it's one of the weakest weapons in the provided arsenal.  The new upgrade system to the nanosuit is confusing and not easily understood and for most of the game it didn't really seem to make that much of a difference especially when cloaking.  In Crysis 2 when I unlocked all the upgrades for the cloaking ability, I could really tell the difference and it was amazingly useful.  The story is poor in itself and attempts to rationalize the bunk about the Cell taking over when they had been decidedly defeated in Crysis 2 by the military...as I said, nothing adds up after Crysis--the writers/Crytek lost their logic compass and became raving haywires on a mission to create nothing but tangents into every conceivable direction.In summation, if you wish to play a really good game that suddenly becomes stupid at the very end, then play Crysis 2.  If you wish to play a mediocre game that is stupid in every respect, then you must assuredly play Crysis 3.  The first one is good too especially when Nomad goes into the depths of the mountain...the nanosuit is not as good with cloaking but  the game is still a thousand times better than Crysis 3.  Are the graphics as good?  In some ways yes and in others no; nevertheless, it's a much better game.Crytek, you screwed up royally.  There's no way to dig yourself out of this miasma, unless you redo Crysis 2 and Crysis 3 and that's not on the drawing table...what a bunch of boneheads!
I bought this because I was tricked into thinking this was 240hz.This display is not even half of that, it is 60hz.They mention 240hz because 3D + that feature for two people on one screen somehow is calculated to 240hz.Since this display takes HDMI, the max refresh rate it can take it 60hz.Other than the refresh rate, the display itself looked a bit grainy. 3D looked pretty decent on this display.I owned this for one day a while back when I purchased for $400, and I am so glad that I returned it.If you can pick this display up for $150 or under, I'd say it wouldn't be a bad deal.
Crysis 2 brings the nanosuit experience to multiple platforms, but what does it lose along the way?ProphetChaos has erupted in Manhattan, New York, an infectious virus is eating the flesh of countless civilians -- this is all the information you, Alcatraz, and a team of fellow marines are given as you make your way up the Hudson River in a submarine vessel. When the ship is attacked by an unidentified enemy, you must escape the flooding death trap only to be mowed down by plasma-like gunfire at the surface. Aliens are in New York.Alcatraz is a marine, a common grunt, and as he lays dying in the water he see's a man battling in futuristic armor -- "Prophet" as players of the previous of games may recognize. Prophet drags the dying marine out of the water and gives him a gift, the Nanosuit, before revealing that he has become infected and his time is up. The suit keeps Alcatraz alive, also making him a super weapon that may also hold the key to defeating the alien invasion, and so begins Crysis 2.It's a wonderful premise, but it must be said now that Crysis 2's narrative lives up to none such potential.Told entirely from the human perspective, the situation in Manhattan is complicated. The U.S. military is desperately attempting to evacuate civilians, while a private military company called CELL, seems to have it's own goals in what to do with you, the man at large in a nanosuit. Multiple problems occur with how this narrative carries along, largely because much of the game is simply traveling -- running through fortified zones of enemies to reach a scientist to speak with, or going to aid groups of soldiers. Everything about how the game progresses is simply direction after direction -- blow this up, hold this position, go through this tunnel. By the time you actually get to some plot development, it's when things really deteriorate.The dialogue is horrendous. Whether it be the ramblings of your scientist friend, Gould, or the over-the-top outbursts of profanity laced anger from other characters, nothing sounds rational in Crysis 2. Each conversation ranges from humorous to annoying, from cliche to simply nonsensical. Even your nanosuit feels the need to repeat every minuscule direction you receive in a heavily computerized, droning voice.And none of this would be so bad if the game wasn't trying so hard to be taken seriously. The plot is shallow, the twists and ending are both anti-climatic -- and the humanistic approach of how it feels to defend a city populated with  innocent lives comes across as awkward and out of place.Tactical Options AvailableThe nanosuit can engage in a variety of functions that deplete suit energy:cloaking makes you invisible to enemies, allowing you to avoid dangerous encounters, pick off enemies with silenced weapons, or sneak up for stealth kills. Activating armor gradual depletes suit energy as it gives you increased protection. And kicks, punches, and jumps can be charged to powerful effect for any reason you see fit.The game helps you out in identifying options, seen through your visor, for each occupied zone you enter. Sniping from an elevated point, restocking or grabbing a new weapon from a nearby munitions dump, opportunities to stealth, and turrets or vehicles to utilize -- it's all up to you. Like it's predecessors, Crysis 2 touts these abilities heavily in how it effects typical FPS gameplay. Each encounter appears to be a playground of possibilities, but it quickly becomes clear how limited the nature of Crysis 2 is.The primary issue is that for players who wish to be creative, there's not too many interesting approaches to take. You can stealth kill an entire encampment, or quite factually, cloak past most encounters in the game entirely. Your other choice is to engage in frantic firefights. There might be a vehicle in one zone or a turret there, but at the end of the day each encounter is very similar to the last. Enemies are challenging and can tear you down rather quickly if you don't balance the use of your suit energy, but they come in very little variety -- ranging from basic human soldiers, to more agile, melee heavy aliens, both being suspect to your usual tricks. Throw in some more armored foes that takes a few grenades to take down, and you have a very typical, if not generic, shooter.Crysis 2 takes place in a city environment, notably less free than the jungle of it's immediate predecessor, Warhead. On top of this limitation, the suit itself if notably less impressive. Maximum speed is no longer an option, instead a light sprint key depletes energy instead -- which seems like a light jog compared to zipping around in the previous games. On top of that, your super strength now comes in chargeable bursts that leave you defenseless after draining all your energy, rendering it's usage impractical, especially on harder difficulties.The feeling of power is stifled by cramped zones and a tired use of the same set ups. It all ends up being a very basic shooter, one that's routine and repetitive.Pick and ChooseOnce again the feature to customize weapon attachments at any time returns, allowing you to switch on silencers for your sniper rifles, different scopes for your assault rifles, laser aiming and more.  Along with this is a new feature that after collecting enough material off fallen aliens, allows you to spend it on suit upgrades. It offers some nifty utility, such as bullet tracing to help you locate incoming fire, but beyond an air stomp ability, all the upgrades are passive (such as improved cloaking or armor) and are hardly noticeable -- a missed opportunity to make the suit a bit more interesting.What If...Ever wonder how a battle between nanosuit soldiers would play out? Well that's exactly what the multiplayer in Crysis 2 is all about, and it's about as ridiculous as it sounds -- in a good way.Crysis 2 adopts the very popular implementation of a rank system, offering gun upgrades and new abilities to players as they earn experience points. It admittedly feels a bit generic, but the nanosuit adds a little personality to the standard multiplayer layout.The first thing on your mind is the first thing on everyone's mind -- cloaking. It's both effective and risky, giving you the jump on people but also making your shields extremely fragile. Other players can spot your blurred silhouette if they look carefully, or use the suit's nanovision to aid in the hunt. Activating armor when exchanging fire with others is a must, but also reduces mobility. Charging jumps leaves you access to elevated ledges, of which you can come crashing down from with a well placed air stomp.It's definitely a more dynamic battlefield than most shooters, a bit frantic and with obvious balance issues, but there's good casual fun to be had with the game's standard set of multiplayer modes (king of the hill, deathmatch, capture the flag, etc...). It doesn't blow the roof off anything in multiplayer FPS, but it can have its moments.The ObviousCrysis 2 looks unbelievable. It's presentation makes for the most cinematic shooter ever made.Cutscenes and interface are nearly all from the perspective of the suit bearer, and this makes for a very real sense of your surroundings. You will be tackled out of windows, shocking yourself with a defibrillator, and staring enemies in the face -- the first person flare is in full force.The way lighting is handled is beautiful, andthe environments look stunning as a result. Foilage, water, city sky lines, and a great sense of scale makes Crysis 2 a game to show off.What's more is the weapon design looks slick, and this helps the gunplay considerably in feel, also helped by satisfying sound effects and brilliant explosions.  The soundtrack is dramatic and well implemented, it's only a shame the game couldn't carry across the emotions it was trying to.ConclusionCrysis 2 falls flat, it abandons elements that have made it's formula more successful in the past -- namely a sense of power and freedom. Instead it's simplified down to routine encounters, and while with elements of choice, they are hardly entertaining. It's immersive approach and wonderful presentation can't carry a narrative with no substance, and though the multiplayer brings some fun tools to the table, it doesn't quite set itself apart from the norm.Single-Player:NarrativeA mature-rated tale, yet with childish dialogue and tedious approach to pacing. Plot developments lack excitement, characters are generic and non-sensible.The VarietyThe encounters are all too similar to remain interesting, especially with a limited feeling suit and lack of enemy variety.PresentationA testament to what can be achieved through a first person perspective, it looks and sounds great from start to finish.Love it or Hate it: Well hey...If you haven't played a Crysis game before, the implementation of the nanosuit may seem more novel this first time around, and in that sense there's certainly some fun to be had with the singleplayer. The issues still stand, but it could be easily worth playing through for some players.The Experience -- 6.4MultiplayerCustomizationRanks, weapons, perks -- they are all there to be earned by every player. Nothing out of the ordinary that leads to impress, but typical customization is here.Multiplayer CombatA standard contemporary multiplayer with the twist of the nanosuit. Cloaking and other suit function add a noticeable dynamic to the battlefield, and maps, although few, offer a variety of approaches.Love it or Hate it: CautionCloaked enemies can be about as frustrating to face against as it is fun to use yourself, and as a result the balance of this game may turn a good many away from taking it seriously.The Experience -- 7.0
This game and the way it plays has me befuddled...now I am getting on as an old geezer and like WWII stuff but this thing after using Call of Duty is a total mystery...for one thing you are thrown in situations and it feels like you are out there by your lonesome, the graphics are sparse(so far)you start in a desert scenario and if you run to an area you get shot and one time does it and if you try to sneak up you get bombed or strafed from above...get in a tank...get blown by a bazooka...go to the Battle of Brittan and you have to run around looking for a machine gun cuz you ain't in a plane...boy oh boy....and like I said the three scenarios I have tried it looks like nobody's home, ya end up running around empty factories and what not...I did max out the bots and all that jazz and it still feels like Lonesome George out there....maybe I'll get on a forum and then again I may just stick to MoH or CoD...Crysis is fun too...another game I got, Hidden and Dangerous is even goofier if you configure the controls the doggone they end up overlapping each other....you know W=forward S=back and so on..game developers aught to stick with a familiar format in my book....

WARNINGI bought Crysis as part of a package (with Crysis Warhead and Crysis 2), and found out the game has problems when using HDMI output.  I am not able to run the game on my projector via HDMI, and have no problems running other modern-day games.It's a know issue with the Crytek issue that people have complained about in the past, but Crytek has never bothered to fix it, based on my research on the internet.Anyhow, avoid this title if you are running a pure HDMI output to your monitor(s).

The Road to Rome is an expansion pack forBattlefield: 1942(BF1942). It covers the Italian campaign. It comes with 6 new maps and two new armies (French and Italians). These armies can only be used on certain maps. The expansion also has an assortment of new weapons and vehicles which again are only for use on certain maps. These includes for the Americans M3 Grant (medium tank) and M3 GMC (tank destroyer/mobile artillery), for the British the Mosquito (bomber) and the 25pdr (stationary AT gun), for the Italians the M11-39 Carro Armato (medium tank), and for the Germans the Sturmgeschutz (tank destroyer),PAK75 (stationary AT gun), and the BF 110 (fighter/bomber). Two infantry assault weapons include the British Sten SMG and the Italian Breda Modello 30. The maps are fun and fairly well balanced. I would also note that even though this is very old title there is still an active multiplayer community. I was able to jump right into a multiplayer game with no lag. However, there are very few servers that actually play the expansions.The biggest question is really is it worth getting. If you already have BF1942, I wouldn't bother unless you are a diehard fan.  But if you are looking at getting  BF1942 then getBattlefield 1942: World War II Anthologywhich comes with this expansion andBattlefield 1942: Secret Weapons of WWII Expansion Packor getBattlefield 1942: The Complete Collectionwhich comes with both expansions andBattlefield: Vietnam.

This game recieved a colossal amount of hype, and from all the hyperbole, was destined to be as large of a step forward in gaming as Populous, also created by Peter Molyneaux.Instead, we have an orangutan flinging feces while peasants starve at the temple because you forgot to dump grain every 30 seconds.I am a huge fan of open-architecture games. I am very excited about AI in gaming on a philosophical level. I was profoundly disappointed.It is true, my animal learned. And my animal seemed to think. But, and this is the crux of it, my animal was EXTREMELY BORING.city maintenance was the essence of tedium. picking up trees one by one and placing them into the lumber depot = not fun. Teaching my pet to do this for me = not fun. Fighting other creatures = not fun.Additionally, encountering the level that reverese ALL THE TRAINING YOU HAVE DONE TO YOUR CREATURE = wiping it off my computer. I have heard that there was a patch to remedy that particular insult to injury, but I do not care. My creature was already damaged goods.So. If you have a friend who wants to hand you a copy for free, give it a shot. Sometimes your pet will be interesting. Some of the spells are pretty. But honestly, this is not worth purchasing.

this expansion pack [is really bad]! the livin large one was great but this one has nothing more than music and food. the dancers u can higher dont take off NONE of their clothes and u cant higher more than one entertainer at a time. the things that ARE good in this game are a birthday cake,punkin and the campfire.and also the all girl and all boy bathroom. once u buy the birthday cake, you are already starting a birthday party, u can choose who's birthday it is that day. this expansion pack doesnt come with the vibromatic heart bed either. when u get the sims house party you will feel like you are playing the original sims.

Pets are cute at first. Kittens and puppies eventually grow into cats and dogs. However, the pets are annoying and scratch up your furniture. You can buy a bird cage, but if you don't feed it, the bird eventually dies. Dogs and cats can be bred and have litters, but they take three Sim days to do so (if there's a hack to speed that up, I couldn't find it). Dogs and cats come out at night and dig up holes in your front lawn and scare off other pets. Adds a lot of modern furniture.Not worth it! My Sims could of lived perfectly fine without pets. After you install this expansion, they only want to buy and train pets. I wish I hadn't wasted my time.
Sid Meier is a true artist in the realm of software, but with each new addition to the Civilization family the games become more oriented toward conflict and less fun to play. In AC the Believers will appear on your  borders within the first 50 turns and you will never really be at peace  again. Forget about the fun of managing a nation: this is a non-stop  Darwinian struggle to keep your head above water. (Some players might like  this, but I find it tedious.) There's no point in trying to negotiate with  other factions because they'll just turn right around and violate your  territory or declare war. Then after you have spent decades trying to build  up your industry, when your output reaches a certain level the planet  itself will being to attack you with an inexhaustible supply of mindworms.  *Every* game of AC is a race to achieve the victory conditions before the  planet itself defeats you, and there's not much sense of satisfaction in  that. Add to this the fact that the game runs unbearably slowly. You will  spend more time watching units go plod-plod-plod across the screen than you  will playing. I really wanted to like this game, but after a while its  defeatist atmosphere and tedious play just got too wearisome. Let's hope  that in his next game Side remembers that growing an empire is more fun and  challenging than beating one.

...The game can be quite fun.  For a short while.Like another reviewer complained, it doesn't matter if your creature has fifty legs or half of one, evolution pretty much plays absolutely no role in crafting your creature at all.  It's entirely a creationist game, as your creature doesn't at all "evolve", but is changed to your specifications.  That is, you can start with a two legged mammal-looking thing with claws for lips, and if you don't like it, you can completely change it to be a legless worm with eight eyes and wings, and if you don't like that, you can make a velociraptor with huge kneecaps and beefy arms.  So long as you unlock more parts to create with, you have absolutely free reign to mold your creature like clay.So the game clearly espouts creationism.The cell stage is simple, but it's quite fun, with your quest to eat little bits of plant or meat, while avoiding larger cells, and you can gradually evolve to put on spikes to poke the crap out of enemies, or poison sacks or electric butts to kill your foes, while the gigantic spiked amoeba that ate you every time you zipped past will soon become your primary source of food.Next, the Creature stage.  This is one of the most fun stages, as it consists of you controlling one of your creatures, hunting for food, either befriending other creatures by dancing, singing, and posing for them, or MURDERING them in front of their children, then eating their children in front of their women.If the creature stage had blood, it would be a damn awesome experience.  It can be a sheerly brutal play, with great pleasure to be had in hunting species down to extinction, or chasing an enemy away from its nest, while cracking all their eggs, and murdering their children when they try to come close.  It's also the only stage where you can do as much of the creature crafting/creationising as you can.  My recommendation is to explore all you can, find all the parts you can, and pick what you like, because you cannot "evolve" anymore past this stage.Tribal stage completely changes the gameplay, to something like a simplistic RTS where you hunt nonsentient creatures, or gather fruits and plants, and bring them back to camp, where food can be spent on musical instruments, weapons, or children.  The objective is to befriend and ally tribes, or destroy their village hut.  This stage is hell to go through, and is exacerbated by poor controls, an even poorer camera, constant raids on your food supply by tiny creatures that will literally camp on your food pile and suck as much as they can.Civilization stage is just a big mess of things thrown together as filler.  You have to waste time designing EACH and EVERY building and vehicle from scratch using the same system as designing your creature, and the vehicle can be as overburdened with crap as you want so long as all the right stats are in place.  This stage exacerbates all the poor control and camera problems in the previous stage, and all the gameplay consists of literal "Feng Shui" as you must precisely place homes, factories, and entertainment centers to get the most happiness and productivity out of your city.  If you're on an island, don't even bother building too many military vehicles---there is absolutely no way to get them over water, not even by transport.All the work in this stage is eventually rendered useless by the use of KIDDIE nuclear weapons, in particular the ICBM which destroys all cities that don't belong to you, and automatically moves you to the space stage.Space stage is the next awesome phase, borrowing heavily from the creature phase with regards to controls and camera, and lets you explore the entire galaxy available at hand.  And since you're on your own, there's no need to micromanage a city full of idiots with shoddy controls.So the Pros:- Free-range creature creation (though it's very much impossible to make something humanlike)- Bloodless murderous fun in Creature stage and Cell stage- Being an obnoxious empire in the Space stage- Low system requirements and small game size, while graphics and collision detection are still top-notchCons:- Insanely boring Tribal and Civilization stages- Insanely pointless Civilization stage (I beat this stage with nothing but military cities, no economy)- Limited number of parts makes you roam around a huge map for hours looking for thirty different variations of deformed-toe feet- Blatantly promoting creationism, thus allowing absolutely no role for evolution, and no purpose for any of the random appendages put on your creature save for the stats they grant.- Camera controls are among the worst controllable-camera controls in any game I've ever played.- Game controls post-Cell stage become sloppy and incoherent, causing such chestnuts in the Creature stage as trying to mate with another one of my kind, only to end up running past them and spinning in circles- Too many things to handle in the Tribal stage with not enough creatures to carry out all these tasks- Allies in every stage are completely useless for everything except not trying to kill you- Definitely biased towards murderous carnivores, as it's easily up to 3 or 4 times harder to impress and ally with another nest/tribe than it is to simply butcher them all and eat their corpses in front of their children- DRM~!!!!!- Taken from the class-action lawsuit claim regarding SecuROM DRM:(...)

El juego no es malo, pero me siento TOTALMENTE decepcionado. Soy comprador de FIFA desde el 2007 y esta entrega se la vendi a un amigo porque me parecio una falta de respeto TOTAL a los usuarios del juego.Como primera medida, las diferencias entre el FIFA 2011 y el 2012 a nivel de juevo NO SON tantas como anuncian, salvo detalles, el resto es mas marketing que otra cosa.Por otro lado y el PEOR punto del juego es Ultimate Team.En la version anterior usaba Ultimate Team TODOS los d&iacute;as, jugaba online TODOS los dias y hasta en el trabajo estaba detras de que item habia vendido o cual habia ganado... asi que era una adiccion total... hasta que salio el Fifa 2012. Cambiaron el dise&ntilde;o de la web a uno que a mi como dise&ntilde;ador no me lleva mas de 5 hrs de trabajo, minimizaron el tama&ntilde;o de las cartas, la resolucion en la calidad de las imagenes de los jugadores y lo que es peor: LA INDUMENTARIA ES MAS CHICA Y DIBUJADA! Ahora ya no se le ven los detalles como antes, de logos, costuras, publicidades, detalles de cada indumentaria en si...Es por todo esto que yo NO RECOMIENDO en lo mas minimo la compra de Fifa 2012 y espero que la version 2013 la mejoren porque sino me pasar&eacute; directamene a otra entrega como PES.Exitos.
el juego fue parte del combo para la PS3 80GB, asi que uno siempre le busca el lado positivo.pero un juego que se jacta de soportar hasta 12 jugadores, como es posible que no sea capaz de simplemente dejar que dos controles se conecten y puedan jugar.uno se pregunta si los dise&ntilde;adores son inexpertos o simplemente no les importa ofrecer un buen producto para obligarlo a comprar otro.  verdaderamente una decepcion.en si el juego es bueno sino fuera por lo anterior y definitivamente no vale la pena comprarlo.
Compr&eacute; este juego basado en comentarios y en un poco de nostalgia por otros juegos de boxeo, sin embargo, esperaba m&aacute;s'. ahora lo tengo guardado esperando que alguien me lo pida prestado pra no verlo mas...
Este juego es solo para ser jugado en red, tremenda limitante!!! Tomen esto en consideraci&oacute;n cuando decidan comprar este juego.
el material; deja bastante q descear no luce muy bien y la calidad es bastante pobre para ser un articulo oficial de sony y psvita
Yes cause he's f**king you over rather ya like it or not. The controlls are not very good but you know this is a bad game when your storyline is I stumbled upon a Dojo an old man says fight for me this was made when Shaq was with the Magic so the old man says you are the magic 1 so you fight a cat huminoid a boogger Sheets a dude from Aku Locka Polkistan a chick who uses voodoo guess what her name is Voodoo Beast and the boss Sett Ra a boss so stupid he would even be passable for a Killer Instinct character. M Bison and Shao Khan were better Bosses cheap but beatable and your attacks are difficult to pull off but everybody attacks you and there specials are more powerful this would have been a decent arcade game but but play it for 2 player mode and the bad 1 liners at the end of everty fight. Good game if you need a good laugh.

As anyone reading this review is doubtless aware, this game is based on the third installment in the Harry Potter movie franchise, which is in turn based off the third book in the Harry Potter series.  This one concerns the third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley as they attend class, learn new spells, fight various enemies, and - by the way - deal with the fact that the notorious wizard criminal, Sirius Black, has escaped from Azkaban prison with the intent to murder young Mr. Potter, and he is being pursued by Dementors, which are Ringwraith-like creatures that act as prison guards and they are intent on recapturing Sirius Black, and woe to anyone who gets in their way.This is my second foray into the world of Harry Potter gaming.  About a year ago I played Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, which was a great (though not perfect) game with a well-realized, immersive Hogwarts, lots of challenging combat, fun sidequests and mini-games, Quidditch matches, good-looking graphics, and engaging puzzles.  I went in to Prisoner of Azkaban expecting more of the same.  I was rudely shocked, to say the least.But before I get into the negative, let's talk about the positive.  In this game, you control Harry, Ron, and Hermione at various times, and each of the three has different strengths and abilities.  Harry has access to the Marauder's Map, which allows you to see mini-maps or the levels, complete with secret passageways and locations of other characters and enemies.  Harry is also able to jump gaps, climb ropes, and is generally the most acrobatic of the trio.  Ron can find secret doors and items.  Hermione can access tight spaces that the others can't.  In addition, though this game offers many spells to be learned and used, most of them can only be used by one or another of the three characters (though the basic spells are common to all three).  All of this does make for a more varied gameplay experience, and adds a certain amount of depth to the (still too easy) puzzle-solving.  Another positive thing about the game is the Expecto Patronus spell, which allows Harry to conjure up a Patronus to use against the Dementors.  This is very well done and is the most enjoyable thing in the game, although controlling the Patronus effectively will take some getting used to.  But that's about it as far as positives go.Combat in this game is much easier than before.  Your Expelliarmus spell for defense will almost never be used.  The basic approach to any enemy is just cast Filipendo at it over and over again until it goes down.  This is complicated by the fact that your lock-on targeting system in clearly flawed in this game, as many times you will attempt to target an enemy and lock on to an inanimate object instead.  A couple of the enemies are slightly more challenging, but for the post part it is just point and shoot.  This even applies to the several times you will encounter Draco Malfoy in the game.  Malfoy is no more difficult to defeat than any other enemy in the game.  This doubtless makes the game easier for young players, but it was a disappointment for me.The puzzles in the game are very easy for the most part.  They are made even easier by the fact that the characters will continuously shout out things like "I wonder what that button does, maybe you should push it!" or "Hey Ron, why don't you cast Lumos Duo on that object over there?" or other such things.  So if you should ever experience some momentary hesitation about what to do next, don't worry - the game will spill the beans quickly enough.The most annoying thing about the game is the fact that, whichever of the three characters you are playing, the other two will constantly run along behind you shouting unhelpful and annoying remarks.  For example, when you have completed all the tasks assigned to you for a level, but you need to explore the castle a bit, the characters will gripe about how tired they are and how they want to go to bed approximately every 5 seconds.  Or if you should ever deviate from the shortest path through a level, they will start spouting off about how you're going the wrong way.  This will drive you insane in a hurry.  I can't believe EA thought this was a good idea.  At the least you should have an option to turn the voices off.The mini-games in this game are dull to say the least.  As I said before, there is no Quidditch, in fact you don't touch a broomstick in the game.  Yes, you do get to fly Buckbeak aimlessly around the castle grounds if you desire, but this is a very poor substitute.  The other mini-games are pointless and boring, and one of them, Owl Racing, was apparently deisgned as torture for your fingers, since you have to tap a button over and over again in a precise rhythm for several minutes in order to make your owl flap her wings and fly.  I did it one time and never again, since I don't particularly enjoy finger cramping.Graphically and sound-wise the game is also below par.  Most of the characters look and sound nothing like their movie counterparts.  The worst is Professor Snape.  I don't know who did his voice acting, but they could have gotten the guy who does Spongebob Squarepants and it would have sounded better.  Of course, you don't hear much of his voice anyway, since every time you encounter him outside of Potions class in the game, he will look at you and immediately go into a fit of coughing and hacking - bascially Snape has a year-long bout of emphysema in this game.  What is up with that?You spend far too much time in this game staring at loading screens.  Every time you open a door, even to enter the tiniest room - loading screens.  Running from outside the front door of Hogwarts to Gryffindor tower takes about 2 minutes of play time and about 90 seconds of staring at a loading screen.  This is far too much, and EA really needs to fix this recurring problem in their Potter games.  Other simiar games don't have this problem, why should this one?  It certainly isn't the great graphics.Outdoors is another disappointment.  Yes, you can fly Buckbeak over a complete version of Hogwarts, but, except for the relocated front door, it is the exact same building and grounds layout as in the last game.  In addition, in the last game, the grounds were inhabited by lots of students running around the castle, which did a lot for the immersion factor of the game.  Here, there is no one outside at all.  It's almost enough to make you feel lonely, running over the huge grounds all alone.  Also, in previous games, exploring the grounds and castle had a purpose - there were secret items all over the place waiting to be found.  Here, there is nothing beyond one or two chests with Wizard cards.  Outdoor exploration was one of the best things about Chamber of Secrets, but in this game it is yet another disappointment.Overall, this game let me down severely.  It's like EA decided that, since the Harry Potter games were intended for younger players and Chamber of Secrets might have been too difficult for them, they decided to make Prisoner of Azkaban much easier and get rid of all the fun and challenge and, in the process, most of the "Hogwarts" atmosphere.  (Although, young kids will probably have a lot of trouble with the Patronus spell).  Unless you just have to play every game with the Potter name on it, avoid this one.  Play Chamber of Secrets instead.  Let's hope that Goblet of Fire is better.

For example, when you have completed all the tasks assigned to you for a level, but you need to explore the castle a bit, the characters will gripe about how tired they are and how they want to go to bed approximately every 5 seconds.  Or if you should ever deviate from the shortest path through a level, they will start spouting off about how you're going the wrong way.  This will drive you insane in a hurry.  I can't believe EA thought this was a good idea.  At the least you should have an option to turn the voices off.The mini-games in this game are dull to say the least.  As I said before, there is no Quidditch, in fact you don't touch a broomstick in the game.  Yes, you do get to fly Buckbeak aimlessly around the castle grounds if you desire, but this is a very poor substitute.  The other mini-games are pointless and boring, and one of them, Owl Racing, was apparently deisgned as torture for your fingers, since you have to tap a button over and over again in a precise rhythm for several minutes in order to make your owl flap her wings and fly.  I did it one time and never again, since I don't particularly enjoy finger cramping.Graphically and sound-wise the game is also below par.  Most of the characters look and sound nothing like their movie counterparts.  The worst is Professor Snape.  I don't know who did his voice acting, but they could have gotten the guy who does Spongebob Squarepants and it would have sounded better.  Of course, you don't hear much of his voice anyway, since every time you encounter him outside of Potions class in the game, he will look at you and immediately go into a fit of coughing and hacking - bascially Snape has a year-long bout of emphysema in this game.  What is up with that?You spend far too much time in this game staring at loading screens.  Every time you open a door, even to enter the tiniest room - loading screens.  Running from outside the front door of Hogwarts to Gryffindor tower takes about 2 minutes of play time and about 90 seconds of staring at a loading screen.  This is far too much, and EA really needs to fix this recurring problem in their Potter games.  Other simiar games don't have this problem, why should this one?  It certainly isn't the great graphics.Outdoors is another disappointment.  Yes, you can fly Buckbeak over a complete version of Hogwarts, but, except for the relocated front door, it is the exact same building and grounds layout as in the last game.  In addition, in the last game, the grounds were inhabited by lots of students running around the castle, which did a lot for the immersion factor of the game.  Here, there is no one outside at all.  It's almost enough to make you feel lonely, running over the huge grounds all alone.  Also, in previous games, exploring the grounds and castle had a purpose - there were secret items all over the place waiting to be found.  Here, there is nothing beyond one or two chests with Wizard cards.  Outdoor exploration was one of the best things about Chamber of Secrets, but in this game it is yet another disappointment.Overall, this game let me down severely.  It's like EA decided that, since the Harry Potter games were intended for younger players and Chamber of Secrets might have been too difficult for them, they decided to make Prisoner of Azkaban much easier and get rid of all the fun and challenge and, in the process, most of the "Hogwarts" atmosphere.  (Although, young kids will probably have a lot of trouble with the Patronus spell).  Unless you just have to play every game with the Potter name on it, avoid this one.  Play Chamber of Secrets instead.  Let's hope that Goblet of Fire is better.
The area isn't exactly the fantacy world Jak and Daxter 1 was set in, that is one of my all time favorite games, everywhere he went it looked plesant, but this game is mostl building reuins, geto, and swamp. You have to check back in to the same location after each mission, and it's hard to find since everything looks the same, and when think you are about to find it you run into the sombody and a large attack begains; by the time you escape you have totaly lost your way again. Jak does have a cool hover board he can flip out at any time, and a laser rifel he can use to shoot the bad guys. I do like the hover vechiles that Jak can "jak" anytime they fly over head

As much as I enjoyed the first Sims and nabbed it the first week of release I realized after a while what a pox it was. Will Wright, the talent that gave us Sim City and all its offspring has been doing nothing else new creativley due to having to work on the Sims, and even SimCity 4 is tainted by the Sim characters you can import into your town.I wish this Sim fad would go the way of the beany babies.

This game is not worth it. You need internet connection to play it. You really don't have that much space to build. Roads don't eat your monthly budget. There is no subway and its hard to build rails in your city. Water don't last forever. You can't issue city ordinances.If you want to build a city, stick with SimCity 4.
Please listen to me and realize that this was a very dissapointing game.  What went wrong I don't know.  EA &quot;Challenged&quot; their reputation making this game, cause it freaking sucks.Pros:- Graphics (Everything is more lifelike and seems almost that you can zoom in further than the other SimCity/s)- Terrain Builder (You can build mountains, hills, or make valleys and lakes)- Airport (This airport actually brings in people to your city and is no longer a zone.  It is pre-made)Cons:- Difficulty (Certainly not for the younger crowd)- Budget (I'm having a lot of trouble keeping money... no matter what- I have like three toxic waste dumps and a naval base missile tester and still my monthly income is negative.  I've raised my taxes and lowered matinence and buses and everything- nothing works.  MAJOR FLAW!)- Zoning (The zoning puts in streets that don't line up with other streets and if you delete you wast money because it's part of the zone.)- Overrated (look at the front of this game.  Never will you see buildings like that- trust me.  I never see blimps or helicopters.)Overall- 2/10 (I like the terrain builder a lot... but that's the only thing better than SimCity3000).Final Word- I was terribly dissapointed with this game.  SimCity3000 is just so much better.  Get it, and save some $.Have Fun w/ SimCity300, cause you WILL not have much fun with this.

The novelty of this game wears off very quickly. At first it was fun to play as several of the Simpsons characters but when they started repeating their dialogue for the 50th time it became mighty tedious and tiresome.The gameplay is very simple. If GTA: Vice City is the Lego Technic of road rage games then Simpsons: Road Rage is, without a doubt the Lego Duplo. It is SOOO aimed at kids. No one over the age of 13 will be particularly impressed with this. It's just far to `safe'. The Simpsons TV show is full of satirical humor and intelligence but this game is just a cheap spin-off aimed at a much younger audience.

This is what happens with a merger that is never given the chance to consolidate: no one gets what he expects.First of all, if you were expecting either SIMCITY 5 or THE SIMS 3 (or even the long lost SIMVILLE), this is not where to look: SC-SOCIETIES was developed not by MAXIS but by TILTED MILL (of CAESAR 4 fame) - but this in itself is neither good or bad. Definetely bad is where they decided to take both franchises though.Gone are most of the gameplay options that made the SIMCITY series a city-management gem. The good old colored city zones are no more - instead you have to micromanage every single building. In place of the zones, there are now six nebulous "social energies" (:productivity, prosperity, authority, creativity, spirituality and knowledge). Every building either produces or consumes one (or more) of these energies. For example, a library creates knowledge but consumes...creativity. Yeah, I know, to add insult to injury, these "social energies" do not always make "real world sense" either. It's more of a trial & error learning process.The functioning of a real city is not observed in many aspects: for example, utilities need NOT be connected to your buildings: if enough power-plants within the city limits, you are fine. I guess Tesla's theories of wireless energy transfer finally found their mainstream niche!Even more absurdly, civic improvements, ornaments and decorations have a cumulative beneficial effect on ALL the city - not just on adjacent areas. This makes as much sense as, say, raising the property values of ALL apartments in a city with a Central Park somewhere...Here is why fans of THE SIMS will be left disappointed as well:sure, your Sims still have info-balloons (depicting moods and needs) but you can have no direct effect on them. You end up playing the...buildings, not them. So, if you though it would be fun to see your beloved SIMS interact on a larger scale...not yet.Graphically, SC-SOCIETIES is a true eye candy! The buildings and city improvements are well and clearly designed (and they are abundant - over 500 distinct items!); lighting and shadows are not only impressive but realistic in perspective and scale as well; and the weather effects (not to mention the impressive natural disasters!) add another level of visual appeal.Now, try placing a beautifully designed and perfectly shadow-casting building that can rotate only in 45degrees increments onto right-angled street blocks! It took me over 2 minute to place a single separating wall between two houses (at maximum magnification mind you). You see, beauty can only be a means to an end when it comes to game design.For such a shallow game, SC-SOCIETIES does convey an illusion of depth. There are statistics everywhere - almost every object sports various info-balloons with them. For the casual gamer, who obviously this game is aimed at, this all looks very impressive. I very much doubt that more experienced gamers will enjoy this ride though.Take you pick based on your experience level.
SimCity 3k has great graphics hands-down, but if you've played oyther SimCitys then you've played SimCity 3k. The gameplay is identical with minor tweaks here and there, but with most of the hype that went into this game left out. You can't tweak individual buildings, or really get into the management of a city as you would like to. Once again things like subways and buses operate without an revenue generation (what country in the world gives away public transportation?), thus tying your economic fate to basically taxes (which are a simple model as well) and some policies. Graphics are great, but the gameplay is the same as before.

I could understand Guitar Hero and Rock Band not having any non Rock & Roll songs.  But SingStar has no excuse with this kind of song selection since it is being marketed as a Karaoke Game.No Motown, no classics, just bunch of songs that the guitar hero and rock band demographics might be familiar with.
This would be a great game, had Konami already not released five (six when the American Idol one comes out) better Karaoke games for the PS2. You would think that when releasing this game in 2006, Sony would look at its competition and make it equal or better. They did not. I apologize that so much of the review is comparing it to the Karaoke Revolution series, but it's a natural comparison, and unfortunate for Singstar Rocks, as SR is by far an inferior product.I have a lot of the same complaints as others. There are no unlockables. Even though KR's strange costumes are seldom used in our household, it's nice to see things being unlocked as you sing more and better. Singstar Rocks does not do this.The big thing is with the PS2 having two standard USB ports, why they would utilize the mini to USB adapter. This renders the mics useless to the KR games. If they're worried about being able to use an EyeToy simultaneously to two mics, maybe they should have included a USB mini hub instead. It infuriates me that with all the decent USB mics on the market that Sony again would go proprietary (of sorts).Another complaint is the lack of adjustments. In song, KR (dating back to the original) allows you to adjust the vocals, mic and music. Singstar Rocks has only a master volume that doesn't see to do much.It's also unfortunate that Sony stuck with only Sony artists, as they are missing out on a ton of others. The song selection is very random due to this and a couple are very strange selections to have on a sing along disc. There are multiple songs on here that do not make a lot of sense. Of all the Rolling Stones catalog, why would Forty Licks' "Paint it Black" be the one to appear. Lame!In a vacuum, the game is fun, but its song selection, lack of options and its proprietary options all make it fall extremely short to any of the other Karaoke Revolution. Don't waste your time with this one. Get *any* of the KR series over this one.

I got this game after purchasing a PS3, thinking that even if this game wasn't all that great, I could use the two microphones (which came with a USB adaptor) for Karaoke Revolution games.  I was wrong.  Because the microphones are not actual USB mics and have to plug into a USB adaptor, Karaoke Revolution games do not detect these "SingStar" mics.Secondly, SingStar does not give you the option to remove the lead vocals from the songs.  This defeats the whole purpose of Karaoke.  Even on Karaoke mode, the lead vocals are still there.Lastly, The game has a very small selection of songs, and there are a handful of tracks that are "medleys", which are basically a medley from choruses of the same songs that are already on this game.Conclusion.  This is NOT a Karaoke game, as it does not give you the option to strip the lead vocals, and the microphones included with the game are not compatible with any other games for the PS2 or PS3.  If I was given the option, I would give this game ZERO stars.

With the high-tech techno/rock/acid music pervading all the levels, the odd controls including the somewhat mandatory option to wield all weapons one-handedly (except assault rifles and rocket launchers) allowing for two weapons to be wielded at once, and the much harsher technological grittiness of the whole thing (insanely high tech items, weird futuristic weapons, cloned enemies that range from looking like SWAT team members to the Vin Diesel character Riddick), this does not feel like a Bond game.I think, if it weren't for the slightly familiar "acidic" version of the Bond theme on the main menu, and the presence of Bond villains like Auric Goldfinger, Dr. No, Pussy Galore, Francisco Scaramanga, Oddjob, Xenia Onatopp and others, this wouldn't be a Bond game at all, but "Random Action Shoot-em-up 2004"The "E.V.I.L. AI" I either must not have seen yet (I'm not completely through the campaign) or is so unremarkable as to be not there.  It apparently consists of individual enemies shooting at you, then trying to run up to you to bash you over the head with their weapons if you aren't fast enough to shoot them.  Since almost all of them wear high tech body armor, it takes quite a few shots from even a rapid-fire machine gun (resembling "Goldeneye 64's RCP-90") to take them down.  There's no blood, no permanent bodies, and no realistic methods of death.  Slain enemies take a second or two to keel over, in the same two or three motions of falling forward as if drunk, or keeling backwards.It's absolutely astonishing that MI-6 would reject this guy (as seen in a cutscene) considering how much of an expert with guns this guy must be.  He's able to wield two separate guns, no matter how big, reload them without dropping either gun for any reason, and can absorb unbelievable amounts of damage (on Normal mode!) and can even regenerate health and armor!  In fact, the only reason I can see that he's been kicked out is because he let MI-6's golden boy James Bond die in a simulation where really there was nothing he could do---Bond was hanging off a ledge several feet away, and by the time Goldeneye reaches him, he falls to his death.One thing about the game that is fantastic is the cutscenes.  The 3D modeling is smooth and beautiful without being too gritty "warts and all" like Shrek, which would probably make this game 4 or 5 discs instead of 2.  The story is actually a good one, which has Goldeneye working for Auric Goldfinger, starting off in a war with Dr. No, and actually making Goldfinger look not like a maniacal enemy seeking the world's destruction, but rather like a crime boss with his priorities in order.  Scaramanga makes an appearance as the inventor of Goldeneye's eye implant (hence his name) which allows some mildly helpful, but ultimately unimportant technologies you really wouldn't need except for one or two instances in some missions.All in all, aside from the cutscenes, story, and main theme music, you would never be able to tell this is a Bond game.  There's none of that flair, style, or mood pervasive in all other Bond games.  Even though you're playing a bad guy, you and your enemies seem of such high caliber, class, and technique, that it makes the franchise seem more like something out of a ridiculously complex spy movie.

All of our "old" Wii Guitar Hero and Band Hero games have worked fine up until this game.  You just start the game and everything is automatically recognized.  The mic and drums have no problem.  I've done some checking online and others have had this problem too.  Your original wireless Wii guitars show up as microphones - not guitars, so I guess you have to go out and buy new versions of your Wii wireless guitars if you want to play this game?
If you like advertisements at every turn, on every vehicle, in allmost every song played and know how to for real really race a car down a buteiful looping course with cutt out cardboard fans.

the ruind the game I like action not to be runing up and down with a uglyest mercenary in the world, I were especting more action
i had such high hopes of orgins, i reallly wanted to like it i did, but it was flatter then a pancake gameplay wise
The storyline seemed borrowed, the first game that came to mind was legend of legaia. A big problem for me was the battle system ussualy i can stay up late and play videogames, but with this the attacks were insanely hard to do. I ended up missing more than i was hitting. The best part was the videos were crazy cool and probaly why it was so many cd's. It's a long game and if you like it you will love it and if you hate it you won't be able to get through one cd.

Mediocre at best.  I'd actually rate it at 2 1/2 stars.  I like the graphics, but the gameplay is not all that "smooth".  If you havn't bought it yet I'd wait until Aug and get 08.  Hopefully they'll have it worked out by then.  I definately miss the hot routes.
Lame game, I mean, I love kids games, but this is lame even for a kid, I really don't get why people gave it 5 stars, maybe they are sony fanboys, I don't know. But I do have one excelent recommendation: Don't buy this game before you actually get a chance to play it first, rent it, borrow it from a friend, then after you spend a couple hours with it, choose wether you like it or not.

I, too, was excited about Spore until I heard about the DRM. That's a dealbreaker.

My SYS SPECS: P4@3.0/800fsb ...RAM - 1gb DDR2 ... Card - Radeon X800SE PCI Express 128mbYet, I had to turn down the Video Settings. The gameplay didn't make up for the demanding SYS REQ. Choppy/Jerky/Slow gameplay and the graphics weren't all that great. MOH:PA almost brought my machine to a slide-show gaming experience.I have virtually nothing running in the background + turned down my desktop resolution to 800x600.Games like Line of Sight:Vietnam; Deadly Dozen:Pacfic Theater and Marine Sharpshooter 2: Jungle Warfare all did a nice job with jungle/foliage, while keeping the SYS REQ within reason.

Graphics. Amazing. Gameplay. Amazing. The seemless evolution from Sims 1 to Sims 2 features. Amazing. Seriouly, this is a well thoughtout game, is its design and innovation. However Ill tell you what's not amazing... The fact that I can't get the freaking thing to play on my machine. I have a 2.8 P4 with a Nvidia 128 card, and 1G ram. So you can understand how I felt more than confident my machine could handle it. Um, well, you see, the game, it simply locks up. Alot. Maybe about every 5 minutes it will freeze for no aparent reason, even my angry furys of ALT-Tab, ALT-Tab, ALT-Tab, could not save me from the frozen pixelated suburban nightmare on my screen. I spent the good part of the evening trying EVERYTHING to get this sucker to work. From using the absolute lowest resolution, to turning off all background processes, to even applying a no cd crack. Nada. Nothing. Zilch. No results. So my advice to you is to keep on checking back to the Maxis website for an official patch to fix these issues. Otherwise, buy at your own risk.

This is the worst bond game ever, and possibly the worst game ever. It is not a game, it's a movie. here are the reasons it sucks:1)EA went with the trend and went 3rd person. This disallows for any entertaining gameplay at all, because you cannot sidestep.2)The co-operative multiplayer is a completely different story than the single player, and all of the characters you start with are generic ppl.3)The Co-operative mode is unbelievably hard. It is like trying to shove a rhino in a soda can. It is not entertaining, and is the most frustrating thing i've ever played.4)You must beat the first "level", which consists of about 10 cansecutive levels, of co-operative to unlock arena mode.5)I have repeatedly completed every goal to get a platinum medal on one mission, but the game refuses to award it to me.6)The only good things about this game are the driving levels, but they soon become repetitive and boring.7)Pierce Brosnan's scrip is worse than that of Dyanasty Warriors 3. After having a discussion with Q about metal, Q suggests he leave. Bond says "Platinum idea, Q, lets test Diavolo's mettle."The line "Bond, James Bond" is repeated at least 4 times, and it is not dilivered well.8)I know it's a little sexist, but the girls are ugly as hell.9)The game is basically a remixed, retextured Enter the Matrix, only with worse hand-to-hand combat, and no focus ability.10)The only reasons to play this game are to see John Cleese as Q, and Willem Dafoe as Diavolo (2 letters away from the spanish word for devil)

Yet another in the turgid 'Wing Commander' series, 'Prophecy'thankfully reduces the amount of dull, plotless FMV, whilst notsignificantly improving the gameplay, which doesn't seem to have evolved very much since the original 'Wing Commander'. Your ship still doesn't 'feel' as if it is flying through space, the supposedly-invincible bad guys are more of a nuisance than a threat, and if you fail a mission it will probably be because you failed to protect something that you were not told about.Imagine watching a bad, low-budget science fiction film whilst playing a modern homage to 'Star Raiders' and you have the game in a nutshell.

This was a gift for my 6yr old, one of his starter PSP 3000 games. Unfortunately, he hasn't played it much, saying it is too difficult. Even his 10yr old, video game savant, brother concurred. Guess I blew that one. The 1 start may me more of a comment on me and not the game. Balance my comments by older player's thoughts for better analysis.

I am an avid video game player, so please take heed to my words if your thinking on purchasing. Even though it is a James Bond game, it absouletly sucks. I ahve probally played every game out there, and this low on the listIt's like they took F.E.A.R. and made it James Bond, and added a little daylight and took away the girl and blood. This game lacked everything a action game needs. Lame, lame, lame.

Neither of my sons seems interested in this game. I thought it was a good idea, but as with my Wipeout Pure purchase, I blew it. My 6yr old gave it his fatal &#34;poopie game&#34; rating.
Killing games purge and I am well purged after this game.  Enjoyed it but I don't play it everyday and I rarely play games to completion. Great graphics which for me is a huge plus and the game play is ok.  Nothing more and nothing less.  Pretty deep analysis isn't it?  Well, you asked after all so live with it.  LOL

Buyer beware - the product description does not describe some importantaspects of the game:This game requires an Internet activation, so if you have no Internetconnection you can't play.Also you are limited to 5 activations - so effectively you are not buying and owning a game, you are merely renting the game.This game secretly installs copy-protection software called SecuROM which can cause many problems for your computer, some of which are:1. When installing the game the user is not informed that SecuROM is being installed.2. SecuROM denies administrators full access to their PC, and blocks theadministrator from editing certain parts of the registry.3. SecuROM can interfere with the operation of hardware, specifically disc drives.4. SecuROM can interfere with the proper operation of software.5. When the game is uninstalled SecuROM is not uninstalled - it remainspermanently on your computer.6. The manner in which SecuROM runs on your computer is similar to that of malicious software called malware, and many people do indeed consider SecuROM to be malware.There have (at May 2009) been five class action lawsuits have been filedagainst Electronic Arts (EA) for their use of SecuROM.
DRM with Activation limits has nothing at all to do with piracy. The game was already pirated days ago before it was released in the UK or America. They are using limited activations to prevent second hand sales and to limit the lifetime of the game. You will perpetually require an Activation Server to be running all the time if you want to install this game in a few years time. The DRM is also the beginnings of forcing games to become a RENTAL revenue model, as per the wishes of Electronic Arts own CEO, John Riccitiello, who wants us all to buy bare bones games in the future and pay for all the content as "extras".(see: [...]).SecuROM has already been prosecuted for using similar DRM technology in the music industry. The DRM that EA is using in Spore is unlawful.You can read the FTC ruling here: [...]
This game is limited to 3 activations. An activation is used when you install or upgrade your computer. Once all the activations are used up, the game stops working!The DRM used by the game, SecuROM, is very invasive and harvests information about your computer and monitors / disrupts other legitimate applications that it deems may be used for piracy. This is an incredulous state of affairs and if piracy is a problem for the industry, the industry should prosecute the pirates and not invade the customers own computer with spyware to monitor them. It's way too draconian.
I just got the game from Amazon. The game comes with the Limited Edition, and it instructs me to go to mycrysis.com/limitededition to download so I can take advantage of the benefits. I created an account, but could never receive the instructions to activate my email; hence, I can't create an account. Because of this, I can't post at the forums either. I click their Help/Support link and found a link for a "contact form", but clicking it loops me on the same page over and over, with no contact form showing up.So as I write this, I'm installing the game, but I cannot download the Limited Edition download to take advantage of the benefits it promises.I've requested the activation email to be sent 4 times now, still nothing. I bought Crysis 2 first with the intention to play Crysis 3 after, but so much for that now.
Avoid installing this on a computer. The software limits you to 3 installations before you have to re-purchase the game, and installing the game installs what is basically spyware/malware, SecuROM, which is known to damage computers, allow hacker access, prevent other games from properly working, disable your CD-ROM from working, and disable your anti-virus software.
With all the great reviews, I thought I would give it a try.  Yeah, it's dated, but I expected that.  Some dated games are fun...I just didn't think this was one of them.  I played it for about 5 hours on "normal", which was enough time to learn the controls and understand the game play.  The map is difficult to read/understand.  The psychic abilities are okay, but switching to them takes a little time...enough time for the zombies or monkeys to kill you.  I found the interface a bit clunky.  I just couldn't get excited about this game or the story/narration.  I thought it was tedious, not fun.I was able to get this working on Windows XP Home SP3, but it took a little effort.If you need help, go to youtube and search for this video: hHg1cXfTUBcHe does a good job of explaining how to do it.Here it is in a nutshell:install the gamefind, download, and install SystemShock2_patch.exein the installation folder, rename sshock2.exe to sshock2.oldfind and download SystemShock2_xp_2000_fix.zipcopy the exe from the above zip file to the installation folderin the installation folderopen shock.cfg with notepadat the end of that file, on a separate line, add this: safe_texture_managersave and exit the fileWindows XP boot.ini changes (BE CAREFUL!)go to control panel, system, advanced, startup and recovery, settingsclick editadd the following line under the [operating system] section:multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS="Microsoft Windows XP - System Shock 2 Game" /noexecute=optin /fastdetect /numproc=1save the boot.ini filerebootwhen prompted, select the "Microsoft Windows XP - System Shock 2 Game" optionWindows boots like usualplay the gameAfter you play the game through to its ending, be sure to remove the "numproc=1" line that you added to boot.ini.Visit my Amazon Collections to see my 4-star and 5-star PC games:http://www.amazon.com/gp/customers/A12LH2100CKQO/collections

The game has been just released. But I am not going to buy it. I used to a have a standing pre-order but not anymore, that has been long canceled. I gave EA a chance to mend its ways but it failed. Here is why.This is a warning Review. Warning of the dangers of the harbored Digital Rights Management (DRM) subroutine that comes unavoidably bundled with the game. This type of DRM (SecuROM 7x with Limited Installations) is well known as it has already been used in at least two other games (BIOSHOCK & MASS EFFECT). So my review is based on first-hand experience of a core aspect of the game.Apparently EA would rather keep its customers in the dark. That is why, in the past month, EA Forums got censored, Wikipedia entries selectively edited and Amazon reviews repeatedly deleted. What is worse, Amazon (possibly without knowing it) is breaking the law which requires the full disclosure of bundled snoop-ware.LIMITED INSTALLS? Yes, LIMITED INSTALLS!!! We only get to ride this shiny pony for...3 laps! The official announcement mentions "on 3 different computers" but avoids to clarify what a "different computer" makes: will changing the graphics card trigger the loss of a token? what about attaching a new hard-drive (internal or external) or adding a new user account. All the above have been reported to subtract installation tokens from BIOSHOCK or MASS EFFECT - and EA has intentionally left this area dark gray.Moreover, in order to enforce the limited installations, exactly like BIOSHOCK, there will be IRREMOVABLE FOLDERS placed in our systems' Root that will effectively revoke our Administrator rights to our own PCs! Short of reformatting, there is no deleting them even if logged in as Administrators.Is EA trying to pave the way towards a nightmarish future where PC gaming will be a continuously-billed service (such as direct-Pay TV) and not a product?Is EA trying to trigger a lemmings stampede towards the Pay-per-Play cliff, where gamers will be regarded as herded cows to be milked over months and years?Is the Company trying to turn our PC systems (that we bought and paid for) into their proprietary consoles, hence monstrosities such as SecuROM that offer zero anti-piracy protection?According to statements by their own spokespersons (such as John Riccitiello, CEO of EA) the answer to all of the above question is YES. However, I want to make clear that none of these statements had any impact on my rating of this game. The game has enough troubles as it is...Is it fair to rate badly a game based on its short duration or bad graphics? How about its instability and bugs? How about harboring potentially dangerous subroutines that will render it useless within a 12-16 months? You see how this is going?In the end, after all is said, with SPORE it boils down to this: who will actually be owning my copy? Are we to pay $50 only to...RENT this from its publisher, be potentially pestered with the insulting need to prove our purchase forever and place our hardware and data in danger?And what makes this even harder to understand: will such extreme measures actually prevent piracy? Of course NOT! They did not work for similarly DRM-plagued BIOSHOCK or MASS EFFECT, why should they start working now?So, one has to ask: what is next in store for customers that make the mistake of buying such a product? Will they be required to pay again to buy another copy of the game when the first one expires?Is THIS the solution that EA executives came up against piracy: since they cannot stop piracy, let's make all our paying customers PAY TWICE to make up for their million dollar bonuses?!NO THANKS! No game is worth such harassment!

I am forced to admit that GT5 gives you a lot for your money, but there were so many head-slappingly inane decisions made about the gameplay that I am forced to give this a hostile review:1.  The main thing I hated about this game was that there were no difficulty settings.  Basically you must take everything at full-bore difficulty, and woe to you if this is too hard.  But really, it's not that some of the tracks are hard so much as the WAY they were hard.  You're driving a car worth about 45,000 and they put you in races with supercars worth 20 million?  (Not just that, but there's no way you youself can possibly purchase such cars at this point.)  This is neither fun nor fair, but there's nothing you can do about it.  So you just start calculating to yourself, "If I were to come in first place in this race 215 times, I would have enough money to buy one of those Ferraris."2.  Another gripe I have is that in this game, supercars are not supercars.  Naturally after you've been playing for a little while you will shop around for a Ferrari or a Lamborghini.  Don't spend your money:  instead, go to the Internet, where you'll find discussion forums that will tell you that you can get a much better-performing car for a lot less, say the Nissan GT-R.  But this is a little ridiculous.  The game doesn't seem right when a 2009 fully-decked out Lamborghini is getting comprehensively out-performed by a garden-variety Nissan sedan!  Something seems wrong.3.  There are no Porsches to be had in this game, for licensing reasons, I assume.  This is probably not the programmers' fault, but still.4.  One can maximally have only 20 million in the bank.  This really blows since the cars that cost 20 million will cost you more than that, since it's virutally impossible to ding 20 million precisely:  any money earned over that will simply not be recorded.  But what really blows is that when you finally buy that Lamborghini Miura, you'll have to garage it until you can buy tires for it.  This really seemed wrong.5.  There exists a big gap between the Professional Series and the Extreme series.  Basically, if you'd like to continue into the Extreme Series, you're going to need a car that is worth several million dollars.  The problem is that nothing you can possibly do in the Professional Series is going to net you anywhere near that amount of money.  There is simply no way to transition smoothly from the Profeesional Series to the Extreme Series.  Hence the only solution is you've got to sit there for a couple of weeks running your B-spec drivers robotically around Daytona-style tracks until you have enough money to continue on with the next phase of the game.  So basically the game gets held up for a week or two while you get on to other things, such as your homework.  This was an asinine design decision.6.  The player is not able to control realism settings.  You've got no choice but to put up with weather, tire burn-out, car damage, etc.7.  The cars you win for finishing certain series can only be won once.  This doesn't make sense.  Can you imagine telling contestants in any sort of game that they can't win the prize because they've already won such a prize in the past?8.  The game plays with you by racing cars against you that are not readily available for purchase, such as the Yellowbird or the Chaparral.  I did not find this amusing.9.  There are not enough tracks!  This is because so many of the tracks are wasted on idiotic races (e.g., a tournament for the owners of a VW Lupo!?!?) that when you'd like to take one of your cars out for a race, there are only three or four choices to choose from?  You can only select the track of your choice if you're just practicing or if you're running cars that you don't own (i.e., GT mode).  But as for taking your beloved babies out on tracks you never get to see them on, forget it!  Those tracks are reserved for the pickup truck races!10.  One is not allowed to restart races in tournaments.11.  Having the cost of re-structuring the chassis be half of the car's value was totally unfair, as was the cost of an engine overhaul.  These prices are punitive, not realistic.  And what's the point of this anyways?  Next up:  having us pay for gas and insurance?  (Incidentally, I discovered that one's chassis breaks automatically without your even crashing the car.  Here's how:  1)  buy new car.  2)  enter race  3) immediately exit race before driving an inch.  You'll now have the option of restoring the chassis, implying that the car is damaged, since you're not permitted the option of paying for chassis repairs if the car is not damaged.)12.  Your car has to come in for pitstops for new tires and stuff:  other cars don't.  On the Extreme B-spec races, for example, it is only your car that has problems with tires balding out about lap 9:  the other cars never seem to.  Why is that?13.  The physics of the game don't make sense.  First of all, it's impossible to flip your car, no matter what you do.  There is no animation for it.  Neither do cars crash or show damage (though you have to pay for chassis damage).  But it goes deeper than that.  It seems like the physics of crashing and interacting with walls and other cars don't resemble reality.  For example, if you go off the track and hit a wall at, say, a 20 degree angle, your car will be smashed back to about a 160 degree angle, facing the wrong direction.  NEVER are you simply "righted" back to a zero degree angle.  It's almost as if the game is punishing you for crashing into walls, but in a way that doesn't make sense visually.  There's more, too.  There seems to be a sort of magnet effect going on sometimes.  Unlike my first example, this might actually be real physics:  I don't know, but it sure feels wrong.  What I mean is that when you run up on the rear end of the car in front of you, your car seems to "stick" and you can't detach yourself unless you completely slam on your brakes.  You can't simply scrape off to one side.  The same goes if your car is running along a wall, scraping along it at high speeds.  It seems like you ought to be able to steer away from it, detaching yourself.  But instead you're magically stuck to the wall somehow, and you can only veer away from it by greatly reducing your speed.14.  Further, the physics of collisions seem unfair.  Every time you collide with another car, yours is the one that is bumped off the road into the sand, never the enemy's.  It seems like this should happen about 50% of the time, but no.  It's virtually impossible to knock an opponent's car off the track:  if you do, it recovers immediately.  It seems like if there is a collision, it negatively affects only your car.  Why do you always get the short end of the stick?15.  The prices in this game are totally messed up!  You can buy a car for 2 million, deck it out with all the trimmings, and then, when you go to sell it, get about 200,000 for it, even though you haven't put a single mile on it!  This is not how reality works.  Realism-based, eh?16.  The game keeps making you go over to Google to find out what kinds of cars you're talking about.  When you're in the used store, for example, how'm I supposed to know that an SLS AMG is a kind of Mercedes? [This was fixed in a patch.]17.  As of the 2.02 update, the game has started to get more mercenary.  There will be cars displayed available for purchase, but you can't buy them unless you pay the company extra money for additional downloadable content through the PlayStation store.  A good example of this is the VW Golf '07.  Before the 2.02 patch, you could simply buy it from the new car dealership.  After December 2011, however, you had to pay more money (literal money, not game credits) to get that car.  Sheesh.  You figure if you lay out forty or fifty bucks for the game, they'd be done hustling you, but no.18.  There's a huge gap with the difficulty at higher levels of the game:  they don't scale well.  After you get the Formula Gran Turismo, for example, it feels like you entered the cheat code and the remainder of the game is uninteresting, if not tedious.19.  The manual sucks!  This game was released more than a year previous to this review, and by now you'd think people'd know how to play the game.  No.  For example, what causes chassis damage?  Is it aggressive driving?  Collisions?  Or simply miles?  Nobody seems to know.  Various websites have various theories, but nobody seems to agree about this basic thing.  But don't look to the manual to clarify that or anything else:  the most the extremely brief manual will tell you is "if you have an epileptic seizure, you should stop playing."20. The tracks are aseptic, almost lifeless.  If I see the Monza circuit one more time, I'm gonna barf!  I can't put my finger on why the Need for Speed tracks seem so various and invigorating while those of GT5 seem so jejune, but it's definitely a problem.21.  There's no way to upgrade your braking and steering.22.  This game features ads up the wazoo:  currently for Motul, Agip, Dunlop, and some others.  These names will change with time because these companies have paid to have their logos plastered all over the racetracks and there's no way you can avoid them.23.  There's no way to prevent the game from auto-saving.  This would have been useful in trying out a car you suspected was a crock. The Ferrari Enzo, for example, wasn't worth half the money you paid for it, but there was no way to test it out and then get your money back.24.  The "Seasonal Tracks" require you to race with crummy cars or cars with a strict horsepower limit.25.  Why can't I paint my cars any color I want as many times as I want?  I have like a billion dollars!  Instead I have to "earn" paint!?  It's ridiculous!26.  There's some sort of bug (or other fun-ruining mechanism) whereby, in B-spec, your drivers don't get full credit for all the experience they accumulate.  This seems to happen about level 30.  You can put them through a 24-hour endurance race, and they'll only move up one level, not the several levels the raw points they've been given should net them.  Then, those excess points disappear somehow and are never counted.27.  There is (alas!) a rather serious bug that's started to plague the game starting with the patch that came out in December of 2011.  When you are in the camera view that allows you to see the back of your car, the frame will jolt a bit every time you go around a turn to re-center itself.  This only starts happenening after you reach about 10 laps of the same track, but it means that endurance races will give you a headache.28.  Er, howzabout warning me, before I spend more than 10 million on certain cars such as the Ferrari F1s that they cannot be used in normal races?  And that you're not allowed to sell them once you've bought them?  (As you can tell by this review, I played this game day and night for quite a while, but this was the thing that finally soured me on it and inspired me to write this cranky review.  Go, little review! Fly! May you decrease Polyphony's sales and cause them to go under!)In sum, it's a little difficult for me to believe I have so many complaints about this game, but I do.  What's not showing, of course, is that I really got into it and played it for weeks.  Hence despite all these gripes I confess that it is well worth the money.  Here's a couple of things I liked about it:1.  The game really gets you interested in racing history and you start reading a lot more about that subject.  That's gotta be considered a plus for a game.  This kinda starts when you're like, "Wait.  Why would a '69 Ford be going for 20 million?"2.  Initially I thought B-spec was the stupidest thing I ever saw.  Why would I want to watch the PlayStation play itself?  That was only until I realized you can set B-spec going while you went off to classes or to sleep and when you came back you'd have a whole bunch of money.  I admit I actually quite got into this:  it was oddly satisfying, heading off to work or wherever, knowing that you were kinda playing even though you weren't there.  It was a great opportunity to get a lot of other, real-life work done during this time.
I've had this game for a week or so now and so far it's been decently fun, but few racing games are able to steer away from leading players into an utter hopeless feeling of frustration sometimes. Some days I put 8-10 hours of game play into it because in all truth, I'm competitive and I like racing games. Fun aside, the game is somewhat frustrating. First I would like to admit a few of my own personal flaws.1. I like racing games, but I'm not too keen to adjustment details (not seen in this game, this game is very simple). Adjustment details that can be found in much more advance, higher caliber, detail concentrated games like Forza.2. Because of number 1, I concentrate more on more simpler games. Thankfully there's NFS. My favorite NFS thus far is Most Wanted and the original older Hot Pursuit (PC). I like them because even though they're frustrating sometimes, the game is more easy going and you win more often. I know that's not the greatest reason, but I feel like the mixture of the two is more balanced in a positive way with those games.3. I'm also not a fantastic or very constantly good player. One game I'm GOD, the next I can't go 100 ft without hitting something.4. I have a bad temper, especially with frustrating games. My frustration is reasonable sometimes, even though I blame my lack of skills a bit more, but sometimes it just can't be helped.So I'll go to the point of way I think this game is lacking and frustrating:(Note that I play in career mode aka underground.1. I play this game and of course the graphics is not that great, it is a fairly old (2003~). Gaming has advanced significantly during that time. Anyhow, my point here is that the details are not adequate enough sometimes to let you see what's coming at you. When you race, you not only have to watch out for your rivals, but also what's in front of you and sometimes cars that not only go in your direction, but in the opposite direction as well. I can't really say that anyone is good enough to react fast enough to all occasions. Two examples would be going down hill where you momentarily go in slow motion through a third person often-side point of view and turning corners, whether sharp or not. I would race and the next thing I notice is a small bit of light and in a millisecond, crash. So during that moment, the details that I see, my head is trying to confirm whether it is a car or something else, maybe part of the scenary? The details are just not clear enough to tell you that to help you react fast enough, it's just very hard. The details in games that have you traveling at this speed with obstacles that are traveling at their speed towards you, should be spot on, clear, and crisp. This goes the same with a very similar other game called BURNOUT.2. Car position and spawning. We're talking about random cars used as obstacles. Sometimes they would stop while crossing the street for no reason, right in front of you. Sometimes, they would spawn near or in front of you. Sometimes they just appear down a steep hill which makes it almost impossible to maneuverer around because you don't even see them until you're practically over them.3. If you play this game, you'll probably notice that when you're near your rival racers, they tend to get into accidents a lot more. Sometimes, they would run into obvious objects to the point where it's just too obvious to be left unnoticed, where you start to understand that they're getting into accidents...not on accident, but on purpose. Like their main objective was to pretend to give you the feeling of a real race, where everyone can have accidents. However, off and away from your view, you'll start to notice that they almost always catch up and rarely get into accidents. If they get into accidents nearly as much as they do when you see them, how do they ever catch up? An obvious accident is running straight into another car even though the other car is still relatively far away.4. I don't understand the upgrade part of the game. They give you upgrades only for you to keep up with the other cars? It's like you never get an increased advantage over the other cars due to your newly/recently acquired upgrades. The other cars will always be as good if not better. The only reason you ever catch up is because of your reckless speed. I know the game is made to do this to give you a challenge, but it also demeans the thought of upgrading. Also take note that the other cars will match your upgrade, so if you don't upgrade, they don't either.5. New cars. I choose my car based on stats and until the 78/79th race where the Skyline is available/unlocked, all other cars have lower stats so what's the use in giving me new cars when my old car that I originally had the choice of choosing (Mazda), remains the best car in comparison? I keep unlocking new cars to drive, yet I don't see why I should even use them?6. Money. I play mostly on hard mode and, until recently started going into medium because it started becoming a game of frustration than recreation. Anyhow, money in this game feels worthless. I have something like 40k++ and I don't see myself ever using it all. I'm almost completely upgraded accept the last three...since when you buy an upgrade(s) for one car, all the other cars that are available will also have those upgrades available to them, I don't understand where the money is going into? I bought all the level paints, almost all the upgrades, full 5 star, and I have tons of money left. Hard mode gives you more money, but I don't see the use of it. I read in some guides that playing it almost completely in medium mode should give you enough money for everything. That's nice, but I don't really want EVERYTHING. I'm a completionist in training, but only when it counts. I'm not a hoarder of stuff that I don't even want. So if I'm not buying a ton of worthless stuff that I don't care for or don't even like, what's the money for? I could very well play the whole game in the lowest difficulty and still probably have enough money.7. There's really only a small handful of cars to use and in underground mode, there's a very, very small variety of maps to use. Mostly, they just make you go in reverse or open up an extra road here or there. You'll be racing in the same area over and over, that's a good and/or bad thing, depends on how you look at it.8. Why is this game even called Underground anyway? I don't see anything "underground" from it that is different from the others in the NFS franchise.OVERALL:This game is a little too much based on luck, especially with so little detail that you literally have to squint to make out the details of what's in front of you. Cars jumping out of nowhere, not getting into random accidents during a lap of racing...one lap is something, trying to cheat your luck on all 6 lap for example...that's just a little too much. The longest I've played a single race is an hour. I wanted to punch my monitor, but it's an LCD monitor and I don't have the money or time to replace it so...This game is so much based on luck, be prepared to click the restart button a few dozen times, especially on hard mode and even on medium mode.Is the game fun though? Yeah. My advice is:1. Keep racing till the end, sometimes for some weird reason, you might seem like you're losing for most of the race, but you might be able to win. Luck and reckless speeding is your bonus over the AI. However, if you're like 10-15:00 behind and you know you crash a lot, it's better to restart.2. Just turn the difficulty down if it becomes frustrating. It's a game, it's suppose to be fun and being frustrated, I'd rather just go to work or something...However, I do notice that sometimes the change in difficulty doesn't always make the race significantly easier for you....

This is one of the most overhyped game I've seen. Commercials and trailers give the illusion of an epic game, but this game is no where near being epic. I asked a few folks to rate this game from a scale of 1-10. A lot of them gave it 9s or 10s. I asked if the graphics and gameplay was THAT great to justify for the high score and many of their responses were "yeah, but I rate it based on how I enjoyed it, but the game was filled with flaws especially the console version.So this review goes for the console version (x 360).I've spent about 70 hours altogether thoroughly exploring and taking my time playing the game and I have to say it is very similar to knights of the old republic and mass effect 1 in terms of control.The plot is similar to the typical medieval setting, reminds me a lot of lord of the rings because think: Dwarves, elves, orc like creatures? Dragons don't exactly help originality here. So for all those fanboys out there that rave about the game, I'm here to douse out your lame mediocre inducing flame about this game that is far from a 10, I mean it'll probably be a 10 if the highest score was 100.FLAWS (hopefully more patches will come out to alleviate some of these problems):UPDATE#11a. Just found another flaw to add to the list. You can't manually dodge attacks. Like in real life, if someone swings a sword at you and you back out of the range of the swing, it should miss you right? Not in this game. Spells follow you even though you move aside like it has a heat seeker built into it. The minute a melee character starts their attack on you, it's too late to even try to move aside because you can be 10ft away and the game will still register it as a hit. So try it, stand in front of a person with a sword and as soon as they start their swing, back off. You still get hit as you're running off....even if you're 5-10ft away...1b. I agree with those ppl that say the end battle is too hard. It is exceedingly harder than any battle you've faced in the game, especially to the average player lacking any outside help like faqs and guides. Even the hardest battles in the game is nothing compared to the end battle, so even if you feel like you're doing fairly well throughout the game, the end battle will catch you offguard. Ridiculously hard.UPDATE #2:Main character has no voice acting. Everyone else has it except you, why does this make no sense whatsoever?1. One of the biggest flaw in this game is the lack of exaggeration, facial and body animation and expression. No way can any game lack so much basic fundamental animation and still be declared anywhere above even a 6. Please play this game and see it for yourself. Example: You walk into your house and found everything gone. A real person would react in a sense of disbelief and a look of horror would be seen in their facial expression - a distortion of their facial features etc. Their body expression and movement would be an exaggerated by wild movements to the circumstance - flailing their arm about wildly, shaky legs due to fear, falling due to clumsiness caused by fear and not thinking correctly etc etc.However, in this game, the animation would be a significantly washed down version where the person's facial expression looks plain but with his mouth open at the most. He would stand there like a dope and the only further evidence of horror would be the yelling that came out of the hole in his face.Play this game and watch carefully at the animation. Look at their face and body movements. Now, pretend if you were in their circumstances or ask yourself: "How would a real person REALLY react if they were in that situation?"  Sorry, but this game is washed out. Graphics and animation in this game is done to the bare minimum.2. Graphics. Subpar at best, especially to the caliber of graphics there are nowadays. I'm not talking about the art, I'm pretty sure the game was suppose to look the way it's suppose to look currently, I'm talking about the quality of their graphics. The graphics in this game has not advance NEARLY far enough to justify any positive remarks to it. It is not even worth talking about. Smooth binding in the graphics is horrible. Watch as the characters walk, their legs go through their clothing sometimes. That is one of the most simplest and basic of mistakes and this game just takes the cake. To anyone that think the graphics is alright, check out other games that recently came out. GOOD GAMES, sorry but this game is a disgrace. Makes me want to get a PS3 just to play God of War 3, totally smash this game in every aspect. I know some PS1 games that'll still smash this game. Believe it or not, there's actually floating characters in this game. I've witnessed it twice, just noticing a character in town just floating 20 foot up in the air....3. Lame storyline. It has a typical plot, beginning through end. You basically play this whole game knowing the exact outcome of it. There are some variations, but the kind of twist this game has to offer is hardily worth a second glance into.4. Battle system for the console version is not smooth and I would find it hard to deal with especially during battles that require a smooth battling system. Lets all admit, lags and delays kill. Play the PC version if you can, it's significantly better in my personal opinion. Example would be you having to babysit after selecting a skill.  Usually when you play, if you choose a skill, you should be at least confident that your character will listen to your command and use the move. However, there is a slight delay and sometimes your character will ignore your commands to use it completely. Many times in this game you'll have to double or triple select moves to make sure they even use it. In the game you are also able to make your teammates hold their positions or follow you. However, changing between either will cause a slight delay in which all your characters are very temporarily stuck in place helpless. This isn't all that bad unless of course you have a horde of enemies on their way or already surrounding you, a one second delay or so can hurt you, especially when it happens over and over again.5. Can't delete save files in game.....you have to go into your system memory....I mean what the heck?6. This one is either me or maybe it is for everyone. I find the navigator for the map useless many times. You know the one that shows you where to go and stuff. Many times it doesn't. I would definitely like the type of quality objective navigation system found in Oblivion. I don't recall even being able to add navigational marks on the map to help me navigate it.7. There's some sexual content in this game, but oh boy is it corny and embarrassing.8. The game should be a bit more clear with choice outcomes, some in which will cause you to lose teammates. I mean losing a teammate that you mainly use a lot in most if not all of your battles is a very serious thing and I just think the game, even though it is RPG, should at least give you some hints at least when it comes to serious choices like that.9. Horrible character development. Throughout the game, I don't think you'll find one single character that you'll be really attached to other than using them in battle. Alistair, for one, is one of the most annoying characters in the game. If you were a woman character, you have the choice of romancing him. However, how can you romance a person that you want to hate so much? Play the game and find out. I'm glad it is just a game, too.10. When you gear up your character and you're not talking to them, you see their gear on them. But when you talk to them, suddenly all of their gear disappears and they appear in their default gear. This game is pact with these little flaws which in the end equals a giant big massive blunder.CONCLUSION:This game is fun in many ways, however, if I had the choice again I'd opt for the PC version. More angles to use, less game killing glitches, less obvious flaws, etc.After playing it, I have to say I'm sorely disappointed because I was expecting an epic game filled with epic boss battles. Sorry, but after you play God of War on the PS2, these games are just blah. They all need to learn the definition of EPIC-ness. Epic, in my book, means a moment that you'll always remember. A moment that put you in the edge of your seat, your heart beating fast, your eyes wide, your hands gripping remote. And when it is over, you have this good and bad feeling in you. Good cause you just played the most awesome and time worthy game ever and bad because it ended and you wanted more. This game just doesn't have that. I'm glad I'm through it, it was sort of fun, but boring many times.
There are plenty of odd and surreal stories. Indeed, some writers seem to find more fun in confusing the reader with mad and fantastical characters, than in actually attempting to tell a compelling story. This is usually a recipe for disaster, but never has it worked better than in the classic tale of the girl that fell down the rabbit hole. Alice in Wonderland has been recreated and reiterated on dozens of times, a testament to how good a world Lewis Carrol has created. One thing that rarely if ever changed though, was that Alice was always a children's tale, with humorous dialog and a happy ending. Madness Returns throws this idea out the window, in exchange for a twisted, macabre version of Wonderland. It's a novel approach, and one I was eager to enjoy, which is why I was so disappointed when I actually sat down and played the game. While it's not completely devoid of quality, it is far from the greatness of it's inspiration, and is not a journey I would not like to take again.StoryAs I said before, Alice Madness Returns is not a light hearted story. The game opens with Alice, having been recently released from an insane asylum, trying once again to put her mind back together. She lost her sanity, along with her family, in a fire when she was a child. All these years later, she's still having hallucinations, confusing fiction with reality, and falling back into wonderland. But the Wonderland she knew is gone. Corruption has spread to it's inhabitants, and a monstrous train is reeking havoc on her world. Alice has to know the truth, and thus sets out cleanse Wonderland, and discover what really happened in the fire that cost her so much.The story is definitely one of the few highlights of the game, and does a great job of pulling you into it's world. Alice won't be the only one not able to tell what's real from what isn't, as the game weaves in and out of Wonderland. There is no end to twists in the story, and when you finally get to the end, you'll no doubt be as shocked as I was about what happened. I should stress again that this is not a game for the squeamish or faint of heart, as the happenings can at times be truly horrifying. The dialog is the crown jewel of the presentation. It's witty and clever, and is very well written. The voice acting that goes along with it is equally impressive, and the game has some of the most unique characters I've seen in a game in ages. You might be wondering why I said I disliked the game so much. Well hold on, because there's a lot.GameplayThe gameplay is a mix of platforming and third person combat. Alice has all the usuals (jump, double jump, glide, and a shrinking ability) to get around with, but when your playing, it's immediately obvious that this isn't going to work. The controls are very floaty and imprecise, and you'll miss quick a few jumps because you for some reason jumped the opposite direction. This is made worse by platforms almost always being just close enough to make it, but far enough to miss it repeatedly. Platforming games have come a long way, but AMR feels extremely dated. You can't grab edges, the game rarely tells you what to do very well, and there are numerous cheap deaths to help pad out the game. I was fine with this at first, but as you go on it just gets worse and worse, and makes the final levels extremely frustrating to play. It just isn't challenging when it works, and it doesn't work when it's challenging.Combat is partially better, but becomes repetitive after only about halfway through. You get the Vorpal blade early on, and this will be your main weapon. It's a quick, light, melee attack that can kill almost every enemy in the game. You also get a machine gun like weapon, a grenade launcher, and a heavy melee (all fashioned to fit in the context of course). These can be used together, but as most enemies have a particular pattern to how they must be fought, there's little room for experimentation. That's not to say it isn't fun, but it does get extremely repetitive and monotonous. I hated walking into a room and having to defeat all the enemies to precede. I just wanted to get on with the story, but the game forced me to fight the same enemies over and over again. With no variation, encounters where always the same, making it feel like I was replaying the same section over, and over.PresentationPresentation wise, the game is both outstanding, and awful. The game has a very unique visual style, resting somewhere between realistic and cel-shaded. It fit's the world perfectly, and allows for both bright and colorful and dark and disturbing levels to exist in harmony, with neither looking at all out of place. The levels are all extremely imaginative and varied, with the standout being a floating castle made of cards. While they are amazing to behold, the levels drag on about twice as long as they should. Just when you think your through with an area, you'll begin a whole new section, doing much the same thing, in much the same way. Like everything else, it keeps you from advancing the story, and is repetitive to the extreme. The world is  populated with great character, all designed to fit in there respective level. They all fell entirely there own, and manage to dodge many of the stereotypes that inhabit so many games. You'll see many classics, like The Mad Hatter and Blue Caterpillar, re-imagined in the same twisted depravity as the rest of the game. Alice is particularly great, and you really start to care about what happens to her. She is also the most detailed, with little things like the way her hair and dress move making her look much more realistic. But the presentations isn't all perfect, with enough bugs and glitches to fill Hatter's endless apatite for tea. Frame rate slow down, clipping, broken animations, poor lip syncing, and a plethora of things I can't remember, the game falls into every technological pit it seemingly can. Non of these would be that bad on there own, but all together they really hurt the experience. It's been a good several years since release, and the fact that none of this is patched is a very bad signed indeed.VerdictI really wanted to love Madness Returns. I love the source material, I'm a huge fan of platformers, and the world looked incredibly unique (always a plus for me). But the game let me down so many times. The bad controls, repetitive levels and combat, and the never ending bugs all made me wish the game would just end and tell me what happens. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone but the most die hard Wonderland fans, that have a case for the macabre, and that can manage to deal with the glitches. Even then, I'd be hesitant, because actually playing the game is almost a chore. If you most know what happens, look up the cutscenes. This is one rabbit hole you shouldn't fall down.Final Opinion: 5/10 Bad
I've been a gamer now for about 18 years. I've played plenty of games on all types of platforms. I love my PSP as I can take my habit anywhere and get my fix. There have been many games put out for the PSP so far, some really good, and some horrible. Having finished Untold Legends - Brotherhood of The Blade, I was looking for another fun game, but something more current. On searching, I found two games, one of which was Resistance. I always thoroughly read all reviews to get a general feel for the game and what others think about it. I have to say, most got it wrong with this game.On receiving the game, I read through the manual. I was disappointed straight out of the box. The first thing I look for when searching for a game is if the controls are PSP friendly, and that means, that character movement is completely controlled by the analog stick. Most reviews said that is how the character is controlled in this game. Wrong. On reading the manual, I find that only forward and side to side character control is afforded by the analog stick, and to turn the character you have to use the triangle, circle, square, X pads in conjunction with the analog stick. This was exactly what I wanted to avoid because games that are not modified from the two analog stick control format of the PS2 and PS3 suck on the PSP because you don't have enough fingers to both control the character AND select weapons, AND aim, AND fire at the same time. Proper control on land should be totally by analog stick.I gave the game a run for its money. I'll be honest, the graphics and art work are excellent, and the story line is interesting. Sounds and music what little there is are very well done. But as one progresses through the levels it becomes increasingly difficult and then impossible to adequately control the character. This first becomes apparent when you try to swim the first time. You get an indicator to press down arrow to dive. OK, fine he goes under the water then what? You have to move the analog stick forward, but if you need to dive further, you have to press the down arrow again, hard to do when your using that hand to move forward. Turning is a joke as you attempt to use the Square and Circle buttons while pushing the analog stick. Down arrow will get you down under and diving, the up arrow button is all but useless as you die, lost and hopelessly disoriented as you've lost all sense of direction. Just to ice the cake they toss in a few Screachers later to attack you while you drown. Frustrating. The proper control set up for swimming should have been forward movement by analog stick and up, down, left, right by the symbol keys.As you progress you naturally encounter more and more enimies. Most of the earlier enimies are fairly easy, and ammo seems plentiful. Eventually you'll cross paths with an enimie called a Boiler. These lovely creatures look like the aliens you saw in the movie Independence Day. They have thick skin though so you have to shoot them forever to kill them. That uses up all or most of your ammo. The idea is, you shoot them in the head and their head explodes killing them. If you fail to do this, they explode their head of their own accord next to you taking away health. Problem, you cannot maneuver and aim and shoot at the same time because your both hands are having to control the character. You get used to shooting at the same time by pressing the R button, but unless you aim with these guys, be prepared to get blown up. Whoops, cannot aim, using that hand to do two other things, sorry. BOOM! This is a recurring major problem that only gets worse as you play along farther into the game. More enimies, less control, more of you dying instead of them. Half the time your out of ammo, even if you pick most or all of it up that you come across, which is pretty easy to do. Health is usually fairly plentiful, but there are some areas they could have cut you a break and laid one in a corner. There are some campaigns where you don't have any health options, you have to beat the gazillions of enimies overwhelming you or you die first. Again frustrating.Another poor design cue is with the weapons. There are plenty of weapons to use, and you get most of them in the beginning campaigns. Ammo is fairly plentiful, but because of control issues, you waste so much of it, you find yourself defenseless with useless empty weapons most of the time. A real problem is that each gun has different abilities, and dual capabilities. One for example is a regular gun in default mode, but acts as a grenade launcher in the other mode. The problem is, you have to aim the grenade and most of the time your needing to move while doing it. So that means your left hand is on the analog stick and your right hand is on the symbol keys, and they expect you to move, seek cover, and fire using your right button, but if you want to use the alternate weapon mode you have to press the left button, hold it then press the right button. So unless your a danged octopus, your not using the alternate weapons often. The other frustrating thing is, you eventually learn that for example the LAARK has some pretty good power. So you decide to select it, would you not think that a well designed game would display a tiny box or something with the gun name shown as your selecting weapons? Maybe the ability to press a button to refresh you memory as to what the selected weapon can do. Yes, you would expect that, but not in this game. Your on your own, all you get is a small icon, so unless you can recall in the heat of a battle while getting your butt blown off what the LAARK looked like, your SOL and DEAD.In the end this game was nothing but a lesson in total frustration. I did not enjoy playing it at all. Every turn was a struggle to control the character and stay alive only to die because the controls flat out suc'd. Designers of games like this where they are too lazy to change the control functions to PSP friendly should be put out of a job, there is no excuse for that type of poor planning and design. I can fully understand now why this game in spite of all of the glowing reviews was marked down to $14.99, still $14 too high in my opinion. Do not waste your time or hard earned money on this turd, buy God Of War first, now that is an incredible game.
I found this to be not merely an unsatisfying video game, but the worst racing game for the PS3 that I'm aware of.I love playing racing games for about an hour or so every day after work to help me unwind.  This game, though, didn't help me unwind:  usually it made me more furious than my job does, which is saying something.I've played, I think, every single outing in the Need for Speed series, and, while I wouldn't have imagined saying this at the time, those titles taught an important lesson:  regardless of how difficult the race in question is, practice makes perfect!  You can get it if you just keep practicing until you know ever millimeter of that track like the back of your hand.MODNATION RACERS, though, contains no such lesson.  Whether or not you finish first seems ascribable to nothing more than blind luck, not application.This is because, in this game, the other racers have weapons they can hit you with, weapons (such as rockets and lightning bolts) that bring your car to a stop and allow the other racers to speed past you.  You could be in first position throughout the length of a race but that doesn't mean anything:  at the last moment, a bolt from the blue can bring your kart to a stop and quickly put you in twelfth place.This can be quite maddening.  It's true you are given a shield that in theory protects you from such attacks, but even if you use all your race points for your shield, you never have enough shield juice to last you through a race and are liable to being hit just before its conclusion.  Why couldn't you have been given an unlimited shield that merely slowed you down?  That would have made this game vastly more playable.)This isn't guaranteed, though, which is why you can win races now and then.  But this makes for a rather downer experience from a video game:  you get the feeling that if you finish in the top three, it's not becaue of your agility on the track so much as simple chance.  You can finish a race 2nd, yet your next iteration on the same track will have you coming in 11th or 12th.  Or vice-versa.  If winning races is a matter of skill, this shouldn't be happening.And the other racers' use of weapons doesn't even make sense!  I'm in 10th position!  Why is anybody bothering to fire a rocket at me?!I think they should put "Ages 7 - 10" for this on the cover.  This is because I think the kookiness and randomness of the races wouldn't anger kids:  they'd just take it in stride as some sort of zany adventure.  Adults, though, are quickly gonna sour on the game since winning a race bears no correlation to how carefully you have negotiated the track or how well you know it.  (Thought:  perhaps the game is a metaphor for the medieval notion of the "wheel of fortune"?)Also:  I mistakenly thought this was a racing game where the player could customize all sorts of things related to the race.  No, no.  You can customize virtually nothing, save purely cosmetic elements such as the stickers on your car or what color helmet your guy is wearing.Here's a short list of things you can't customize:a.  how many laps each race isb.  the weatherc.  the number of racers in each lapsd.  whether or not to allow weaponse.  what position in the starting lineup you're givenf.  you can't remap the controls!Here's a list of some other things that variously irritated me:1.  "Casual" mode is not easy at all.  I would say it's too difficult to be fun, cause after about 15 times around the same track, there be no joy to it, maties.  Be prepared to do some tracks 20-30 times before pure dumb luck lands you in a spot in the top 3 and you are permitted to advance.  Actually, the "Casual" mode itself was a patch that came about because of widespread outrage at the difficulty of the game as originally issued:  but United Front Games apparently didn't get the point of those complaints:  "Casual" is still punitively difficult.)2.  You must always start last.  Why?  Why couldn't your starting position have been random?  Am I being punished for something?3.  The game "announcers" repeatedly insult the player unless he wins the race.  This is one of those ideas that I think sounded a lot funnier on paper than it turned out to be in the actual game.  When you're playing it just gets demeaning and mean-spirited.  If a teacher said such things to a child, it would be actionable.4.  There is no way replay the crucial tutorials given at the beginning of your career.  Or choose "New Game" and reset absolutely everything. You basically have to delete the game data from your PS3's hard drive and completely start again!5.  The game cheats.  You can be zooming along a staightaway going full bore and the AI cars can speed right past you as if you're standing still.  How is this possible if all the racers are driving the same car?6.  The load times are pure murder.7.  The tracks have no character.  They aspire to, but in the end the developers included so many random elements in each one that in the end they're indistinguishable.8.  You can't just get on with the racing in this game:  you're basically obliged to do all the stupid tricks (twirling on your jumps, using weapons, etc.) to win.  Not a good feeling if you'd just like to race:  it's more of a combat game.9.  Kinda blows how when you discover a shrewd shortcut, the game resets you, claiming "illegal shortcut."  Hey, I found it!  If you didn't want me to find it, why did you make it possible, you morons?10.  You can get a bonus if you thrust at the very moment the announcer says "Go!"  But it's rather infuriating what happens if you "jump the gun" on this.  Your character refuses to race ahead, instead turning around and making a cryptic hand gesture to you.  Whose side are you on, you little snot?  I can understand not getting the bonus, but why am I being punished?11.  Blows how you have to confirm a race restart.  This slows everything down.  Restart now!12.  The countdown before the start of the races takes too long.  Another thing that's gonna grate on your nerves since you'll be restarting certain tracks dozens and dozens of times.  The first time I could imagine, but why do we have to go through this again and again?13.  The game does feature "authorized" shortcuts, but I don't understand them.  If ALL the AI racers are taking them, THEY'RE NOT SHORTCUTS!  They're just the route!14.  Really blows how you can't check out of a race and simply drive around exploring the track, or going back to inspect what messed you up.  Instead you immediately get a "Off Track!"
I am in no way a person that typically has issues with Gran Turismo. I loved and watched and probably played at least some of Gran Turismo 1 and 2. I have owned Gran Turismo 3,4,5,6 and even the motorcycle Gran  Turismo gasme that was made for Playstation 2. The reason I own a Playstation 3 is so I could play Gran Turismo 5. If I ever do buy a Playstation 4 it will probably be to play Gran Turismo 7. So why a 2 star rating for Gran Turismo 6?...Fun... People who make video games have somehow in large part forgotten the reason why a video game should be made or exist. Fun, Fun, Fun,... this should be the motto hanging on the wall of any video game producer. Gran Turismo 6 has some fun, for sure, but it has way to much Frustration! I have no clue, why they thought every single race should start with all cars already in motion, and with the lead cars, plenty far out in the lead.They did a great thing with making the license test bronze times much easier to attain, for unlocking new races, but the one HUGE thing that has frustrated me to no end, is the GT World Championship Race that must be won, or at least a bronze medal earned to be able to unlock the S license  TESTS so that the rest of the races can be unlocked. I do not have good eye sight, as a result of Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (if anyone reading this has M.S. I believe it should stand for Mercury Saturated, look at the known health effects of Mercury toxicity and compare those with your symptoms. Any silver filling you may have in your mouth is 50% mercury, I had ten of them, the progression has mostly stopped since having them PROPERLY removed) that has put me in a motorized wheelchair basically every waking moment. The crazy difficulty of this race combined with my poor eyesight has kept me from even being able to attempt the S-license tests. The thing I have always loved about Gran Turismo is the endurance races. I love racing cars, and I really wanted to see any improvements that may have been made to the pit stops since Gran Turismo 5. I have collected every single car that I could find in GT5. In GT6 I have purchased a 2 million credit formula car, which I will never be able to race with until I get my S-license. I've currently got 4 cars (not counting the formula car) with over 700 performance points each and so far have not been able to get third place or better in any of the races I need to pass to unlock the S-license tests with.How Gran Turismo 6 could have been a 5 star game, and how Gran Turismo 7 could very easily be a 5 star game in my book:Every Gran Turismo game has had TONS of cars and a whole lot of race tracks. Why are there less races than there are cars??? They should make at least one race that is exclusive to every car in the game and then just add lots and lots more races to the game. It is supposed to be a game about racing, Right? Put the cars and tracks to use in a huge way. I do not care if there are all kinds of races that I will never be able to win, but make a ton of races that everybody will be able to win, and structure the game in a way where everyone can at least have access to starting most any type of race that is in the game. Winning races is of course based to at least some degree of skill, but most people who participate in any race are not going to be the winners of the race. Gran Turismo is supposed to be about racing, so please let people get into the races, that is what anyone wants to do that buys a Gran Turismo game. This would make the replay value potentially nearly unlimited and in my book would make it a 5 star game.Damage and the ability to turn it on or off would of course be a fun plus. I have loved the Red Bull X cars, and I really like the future prototypes that look to be added to GT6. Hopefully eventually I will unlock the S-license tests.Notice even with my bad review, I have not totally given up on the game. There is a lot to like, but the amount of frustration drives me to the point of wanting to give up. Frustration is basically the opposite of fun. Frustrating and hard races can be ok, but they should be optional races that do not hinder reaching major portions of the game. I would love to see Gran Turismo 7 sell 100 million copies, due to it being massively fun, fun, fun. Like it very easily could be.Update 1/4/2014One good thing to wait for maybe? B-spec mode when released may make it easier to get the super license tests opened up, so that the other races will unlock. This would be very positive, also grinding in B-spec for money should be much easier.One more very irritating and FRUSTRATING thing with gt6. Apparently they really wanted to showcase how totally lame, totally lame tires function. So for ALL of the races I have seen so far, the BEST tires you can use is racing hard. This would be great for someone, if there is someone, who really loves driving really powerful race cars, that go totally out of control any time you want to do something like turn your car. Realistic behaving tires are fine and good, but it is NO FUN to be forced to drive on lame tires while trying to catch up to cars that were a half a lap ahead of you, when the race began.
I got the game for free because I bought the Xbox One Titanfall bundle.  I figured I might as well get the bundle to receive the game for free.  I must say, I'm glad I went that route instead of spending $60 on it.I can't really think of a redeeming aspect other than it's good for some mindless action gaming when in the mood for it.  And, when in the mood for that, it gets the job done.  That's why I give it 2 stars instead of 1.  Now, for the reasons I don't think much of this game.The graphics aren't impressive.  If I walked into a room and saw someone playing this, I wouldn't know if I'm looking at a Xbox 360 or Xbox One game.  Before anyone tries to claim it's because my TV is not good, I'm playing on a 52-inch Samsung 1080p LCD.  My TV is not the problem.  The game's environment is muddy for the most part, there is a lot of brown everywhere you go.  I also don't see any environmental destruction.  If you shoot a wall with a titan's cannon gun, the wall is still standing after the smoke clears.  Enemies can hide behind a barrel the entire time, no matter how many missile shots it takes.  The story is worthless, I don't care about it or any of the characters in the game.  It's as if Respawn tried to create something meaningful, but what they delivered is not interesting at all.  Two factions are fighting over energy on different planets with no characters to base the story around, at least that's what I think is happening.  I understand I'm a grunt, but shouldn't there be somebody leading this story to its conclusion?  Each match basically boils down to running around and killing as many opponents as I can or capturing an enemy's flag.  I don't know why I'm doing it, but I'm doing it nonetheless.  "Campaign" mode is not a traditional campaign mode.  It's online multiplayer with the previously mentioned attempt at a story.  It is one online match after another, there is nothing to develop a story aside from banter by a couple of digital faces that appear on your screen via the HUD as they try to convey drama and a sense of desperation that simply is not there.Speaking of online multiplayer, it's 6 vs. 6 at all times.  Why are there so few players on a next-gen console?  Instead of providing more human opponents, the game fills the maps with mindless bots who can be dropkicked (literally) to death as they stare at you with their guns pointed at you for 5 seconds.  Fighting these bots reminds me of the scene in Monty Python and the Holy Grail where Sir Lancelot approaches the castle on a loop for about 30 seconds as the guards watch him the entire time.  They then seem surprised when he reaches them and stabs one with his sword, just like these bots are unsuspecting of your run toward them with your lethal dropkick prepared to impale them to their digital deaths.  The humans who are in the maps are mostly running around like chickens without heads spraying and praying until their 24-foot tall robot is available for occupation.  Once in the robots, the humans continue their spraying and praying tactics without trying to achieve any objectives, such as capturing the enemy's flag or a waypoint.  There is no organization as a team in this game, just people sprinting and floating with jetpacks in an attempt to get as many kills as possible so they can see a high number next to their name after the match is complete.  If you play with friends who are dedicated to playing the modes the way they're intended to be played, I'm sure the experience is slightly better.  But, if you're playing with strangers, it's an all-out mess of a rush with no direction.The audio is decent, nothing spectacular is happening.  The sounds of gunfire are heavy and the footsteps of the titans are satisfying.  But, the audio isn't of a quality I haven't heard before.In the end, this is just another frantic FPS with no real reason to play for an extended period of time other than trying to level up.  But, after leveling up, then what?  The weapons are not plentiful as in other FPS games, so the variety is pretty limited.  When playing Titanfall, I feel like I've already played the game a hundred times before, but with different titles.  Nothing about it says "next-gen" to me, nothing.  I feel like I'm playing Call of Duty on the 360, but with robots thrown into the mix and stupid bot enemies/teammates to make the experience even worse.  By the way, the novelty of robots wears quickly, especially after you see how fast they're destroyed by opponents.  A titan falls from the sky, gets a few rounds off, and then explodes seconds later because an entire team's attacking focus is on that titan.  Players wait 2 minutes for 15 seconds of robot action.This game is not the recipe for excitement, longevity, next-gen gaming, or fun.  It is my opinion that this game was very much overhyped and not worthy of some of the high praise we have all seen.  I would not recommend it to a friend.Edit- For those saying my review is not helpful, can you please leave some feedback as to why it didn't help you?  I commented on the visuals, audio, gameplay, and story.  Knowing how I can improve my review would be very helpful for me.
First of all, im a big fan of Resistance series. Part 1 was amazing gameplay and story. Part 2 was amazing graphics and boss fights. Part 3 was so bad, I felt like this was rushed to be on the market. First thing, so many bugs. My PS3 froze couple of times. Its not my PS3. I played Deus Ex and didnt freeze,i played other games in my PS3 and they didnt freeze. I might have a bad copy. Put this one back in, Froze when it went to a cut scene. Second. The Graphics was bad. Even G4 and IGN even said part 2 was a little better. Part 1 and 2 scored higher score than part 3.couple of times i fell through the floor and died. The Story was really bad. If you look at the revolver from part 2 and look at 3, you can see they didnt even care about details in the graphics. You can tell they rushed this game. You have to pay to play online.I got mine used. Are you kidding me. Part 1 and 2 was FREE.They really thought this game was going to be epic LOL.Of the Gameplay was like part 1 or 2 then yeah, this game was so easy to beat on the hardest gameplay. Every time it went to a cut scene took a while or skip bad.When Joe kid "jack said", "DADDY" sound like man midget who said that,i see they didnt care about voice acting or paying a kid,a real kid to say that line. they could of spend a little more time on this game and came out with a little better story and graphics.The story didnt even expand what you already know from part 1 and 2. The sad part they couldnt tell the story of the whole aliens from outer space and coming back to earth from a long time ago. They had to put the story in book picking up in the game. SO if you didnt collect all the books, you never know the back story to the aliens.I felt like I was playing SIDE MISSIONS to get to the end of the game, For the last Resistance game they could of did CGI instead of crapy art at the credits,This game could of been GOLD like God Of WAR 3. But they did a crapy game. EVEN in Superhuman mode was easy.This wasnt a story, was side quests. The real story was in books if you collect them all in the game. I will sell this and just keep 1 and 2. They were great. I thought having a big ammo BAR was really dumb. I wouldnt mind if they took 1 more year to touch this game up and did a better story. WHat a waste of $65. RENT THIS GAME DONT BUY. If you play part 1, the story went deep. Part 2 was short but the boss battles was amazing. Part 3 lacked, Story,gameplay,Boss Battles. I really loved the Hammer. To bad they didnt put it in the start of the game. The Prison was a waste of Time in my opinion.I was hoping they would of had a big cut scene of the story how they came to earth and why they left. In my opinion the best part of the game was 2 things, Letting us know what happen to Nathan Hale after he died, and the second, The ending with you hanging down with your handgun going crazy like a cowboy. The Boring part was the prision. They could of left that part out and took that time to make one hell of a ending.Come on people. YOu have to admit the ending ws crap and the story was as well. All i wanted was a Great ending to this series and one hell of a Story of thier back ground, Instead i got a back ground of a prison and a missing husband of a godly women whos been praying for a fighter to arrive at her town. IM NOT MAD. I ENJOY THE GAMEPLAY I HAD FUN. IN MY OPINION THEY COULD OF DONE SO MUCH MORE. GO OUT LIKE GOD OF WAR 3, GEARS OF WAR 3, LOOK AT METAL GEAR SOLID 4 JESUS THAT WAS A EPIC GAME. IM NOT SAYING BE THAT LONG OF A GAME OR GRAPHICS. MAKE THE LAST GAME BAD ASS SO EVERYONE WILL TALK ABOUT IT, INSTEAD IM TELLING PEOPLE DONT BUY IT. I LIKE THIS GAME I HAD FUN. SO IM NOT SAYING THIS GAME SUCKS. THIS GAME COULD OF HAD SO MUCH MORE DONE TO THIS.Let get this straight. I know they had an extra year to work on this. But honestly, your saying this was a GREAT STORY and GREAT GRAPHICS for this Generation. This game was so buggy. My PS3 froze and I let my friend use this, he gave it back to me.His Ps3 froze when he was playing this. Its the game that needs to fix. I dont care they had 3 years. This game looks bad. Stop lying to yourself saying this game is great. Im sorry, If IGN and G4 says the same things almost all of the players who played this game. Maby all you guys lying to yourself.If you can't read this review, You are the dumbest person alive. If you can't read this, You don't know how to read or a illegal or just plain stupid.

I expected downgrade textured since it was a port but... Game was unplayable, many times dipped to 10fps and would crash. Had to return to amazon for refund.I heard a new patch will fix these issues, but I'm not gonna wait.Warning to trophy hunters. The vita version trophy list is shared with ps3. No new trophies I'm afraid!
This game was released about 2003 and developed over the 5 years prior to that. It also is completely unsupported by its "owners" EA (which bought it from Maxis)and has been for pushing a decade (it is a "cash cow" only). It is out of it's element on todays machines. The game is single-threaded and has its own scheduler. It is not well-adapted to a multitasking environment. It also can be rather snarky in getting along with some graphics cards. This means it has some real quirks and issues such as occasional failures to save, or lost cities, or "crash to desktop" (CTD's). On the other hand these can be countered by frequent saves and backups along with certain "habits" in the play methodology.If one does this, this game has some real appeal to many people.The game was released as a core game, Simcity 4 (SC4) and an expansion, Rush Hour (RH) which in combination was dubbed "Simcity 4 Deluxe" SC4D. The Rushhour expansion used to be available seperately, but is quite scarce and/ or very expensive nowSimCity 4: Rush Hour Expansion Pack.This particular release is only SC4 and frankly is essentially unusable by itself as much of the elements of the game, and much of the expanded customizable hooks, especially the "networks" part.. that part which handles the commuting and travel mechanics, allowing a wide array of "transportation" simulations. To be really useful you MUST (IMO) have the FULL set available in several forms (see below). My low rating is for THIS VERSION ONLY. I really quite like the game itself in its full, properly-registered form.There also is a very active community, especially in the USA, Germany and Japan and lessor followings in many other countries. This group is very community oriented and supportive. Maxis was clever to embed into the game "stubs" which support a wide array of end user customization content, and this community generates active interest which carries the game well beyond its years. This group congregates on a half dozen or so "support sites" (all free) which are accessable by all. I'd estimate there are probably about a half million fairly active players worldwide.The game is not played versus other players (other than in comparing accomplishments or progress or sharing custom content). It is a "strategy" game based on figuring out the operation and biases of the game and designing your city designs to best overcome and conform to these needs. There isn't "an answer" but rather a broad array of approaches that work to varying degrees based on what you are trying to achieve (dense ghettos, idylic contryside, sleepy towns, etc) A single "regional development" can easily take weeks to months of off and on attention to work through these issues. If these kinds of things appeal to you, this may be the game for you, just not in this version.The game uses a copy protection scheme that requires the CD to be in the machine to play (or in the downloadable Amazon or Steam versions a running "game support" program that validates the game) Some folk are rather put off by this.In summary, though this is still the core of the game, DON'T BUY THIS VERSION.. buy the full set.SimCity 4 Deluxe Editionor the downloadable versionSimCity 4 Deluxe Edition [Download] (also available via Steam) or as a subset of a box set with other games includedThe SimCity BoxI have heard there are support problems with the patches on the box set, but don't  have personal experience with it. The downloadable versions should be "pre-patched".Be VERY CAUTIOUS buying a used version from eBay, etc as you MUST have the registration membership in the EA/Maxis web site to update the game with it's patches.. only buy if you can get this membership with its User Name and Password included or certification that the serial number has never been registered... many people have been burned on this matter Even buying "new" versions is risky as many are just pirate copies of the game and the registration number will report "already in use" even though you "bought it" as "new". Get the seller to guarantee the version is register-ableSorry to be so long-winded, but I felt most of this needed to be touched upon. In whatever form you buy it, I recommend immediately taking a look at web sites which have active communities interested in the game. You can happily invest many hundreds of interesting hours in the game if you're willing to invest the time.

Rushhour is CRUCIAL to the satisfactory play of Simcity 4. The game was released as the game, then this Rushhour expansion , then the combination (called SC4 Deluxe). Since the Deluxe version is available in several forms (which include Rushhour) it is just crazy to pay this kind of money for the expansion alone. I don't normally rate things based on cost, but in this case a downgrade is warranted. This rating is for THIS expansion offerYou may want to check out the CD versionSimCity 4 Deluxe Edition, the downloadable versionSimCity 4 Deluxe Edition [Download] (also available on STEAM) and though most MAC users run it on Windows emulators, the Aspyr versionSim City 4 Deluxe (Mac).

I just got a game cube for christmas in which case i got two games tony hawk's pro skater 3 and Luigies mansion. I found Tony Hawks 3 quite good and Luigies mansion OK. Then at the beggining of January I got Super Smash bros. Melee Which was like the best game ever in my opinion. At the end of January I got Simpsons Road rage. There are only 2 good things about this game. Nmb1. The Graphics are great like all gamecube games. Nbm2. It's a good Multyplayer game. Now I have 7 reasons not to buy the game Nmb1. There are only six levels. Nmb2. After you complete the game nothing happens. Nmb3. There's no story line. Nmb.4 You can Only Play Up to 2 players. Nmb5. If it's basicly a remake of Crazy Taxi. Nmb6. I beat the game in 2 hours. Nmb7. After 2 days you'll just be trying to sell it.

Loved HL2 but that was when STEAM was only mildly annoying. Now the STEAM activation system has reached a whole new level of sadistic pain. I won't rehash what's been described below but suffice to say it takes longer to activate this game than play it. The game HL2 Ep 1 is OK but nothing new but hey who wouldn't rather spend 2 hrs trying to activate the game ala STEAM than play it. I think I'll pass on HL2 Ep 2 until Valve comes to their senses. In the meantime, if I want to frustrate myself I'll go back to trying to purge my system of all the STARFORCE subroutines (I can only imagine what STEAM has bugged my system with?).

It all happens as soon as you read the title, the acid in your stomache just churns up.Shaq Fu was one of those gaming horrors of the 90's that should have never been, just like his awful, awful movie career.I feel like my intelligence decreased after playing it, but back then I was but a mere child and I loved fighting games (as well as RPG's). As such I was easily sucked into playing any fighter that rolled out of a factory, thank god I had only rented this mediocre title.The graphics were pretty good I'll admit, but then there was Shaq to remind me that I was playing an absolute piece of crap. The characters clobber each other with puns before a battle ensues, oh dear god!! After your brain is crushed from the weight of sheer bad humor the fight starts. At this point you take a deep breath and think "Well at least that's over...". That is if you haven't gotten to the point where your thinking "!$@@&%*@!!^$$#...." and believe me I'll understand if you have.If you've lasted this long then....I PITY YOUR SOUL!! Anyways, the fight starts and it's incredibly easy...to the point that enjoyment is null and the fact that your playing Shaq Fu doesn't help cure that sudden acid reflux problem either. I beat it in about 20 minutes *yawn* (or was it *urk* I forgot...).I beg of anyone that's even considering buying this or god forbid, even playing this PLEASE!!! Your not missing a thing, in fact you'll thank me and anyone else that has a similar opinion on the matter. Playing a great 2-D fighter like Samurai Showdown or Street Fighter II is far better than having prematurely gray hair and vomit all over your favorite shirt (and being mentally scarred).If you own this game, there's an easy cure. Either melt it in a fire or throw it in the sea or anything that makes it dissapear from existance, please don't sell this game to anyone. It's an insult that this game was even made.

I've had Titanfall Collector's since launch. As far as the game goes, I could not be happier and I'd easily rate it 5 starts. But for the CE, I've got serious issues with the statue.Over time, the grunts that came with the Titanfall CE have started to warp and sag, leaning over to the point their faces hit the ground. They just kind of mushily bend over. I contacted EA support to see about getting a replacement or help and except for the initial contact they never got back to me. My ticket was escalated to a specialist and it went nowhere.While the Titan in the CE looks amazing and has held up, the grunts have not. It's seriously disappointing, especially for the cost. My roommate also has a copy of the CE version and is having the same issue. The grunts just kind of &#34;melt&#34; ever so slightly over time.
In order to be impressed by the graphics, you need a HDTV.  Without one it's a touched up GT3, jaggies and all.  The city tracks are nice to look at, but the actual race courses(laguna seca) are poorly done, especially considering there are only 6 cars per race.  I didn't want to use the F word(I'm not even getting it), but the side-by-side video between GT4 and Forza's Laguna Seca is an eye-opener.  The PS2 is capable of more than this.To notice the physics differences, your going to have to have the $150 wheel.  This is the only real addition worth buying the game for, but most people are going to skip it due to it being as much as a new console.  The bottom line is the game in this day in age feels dated and wooden without the wheel.  Now this doesn't apply if you didn't play the other GT's, but what the hell kind of racing fan hasn't.The interface is pretty much the same as always.  Sure some things like races are better organized, but they are just sprawled all over the place on the map.  And you know that little Garage icon from earlier GT's.  Say goodbye to that.For all the delay hoopla, nothing meaningful was done except PD playing around with obscure japanese cars.  No online play, AI or damage will mark the GT series' downfall.  Enthusia, nevermind inevitably forza, might take the crown away this year.  Unless you meet the far-fetched criteria needed to see changes, you are better off passing on this game.

Next gen is here and according to Sony, &#8220;Greatness Awaits&#8221;.  It looks like greatness may have to wait a little longer though because &#8220;Killzone Shadow Fall&#8221; definitely isn&#8217;t it.Now don&#8217;t get me wrong.  If drop dead gorgeous, but painfully generic first person shooters with aggravating and pointless free fall/flying sections are your thing, and you love games that are hollow, shallow and soul-less to their very core-plus you are completely opposed to anything that even resembles action in your first person shooter then you are in for a monster treat here.For fans of the Killzone Series however, outside of a few cut scenes there&#8217;s really not much here that immerses you into the rich universe that is Killzone.  There&#8217;s no longer a sense of being a star player or a hero in an epic war raging between races.  There&#8217;s no sense of urgency or feeling that you are immersed in an epic battle to save mankind.  Honestly there doesn&#8217;t seem to be much of any kind of threat here at all when it comes down to it.  There&#8217;s lots of walking around though.  Lots of walking around.  See that waterfall over there?  Yep.  You get to walk over to it.  See that scientist?  Yep.  Instead of shooting and blowing things up (who wants to do that?), you get to walk with her for a while.  You also get to experience the joys of meandering aimlessly through large and completely barren terrains not having a clue where you are going because your direction indicator doesn&#8217;t work half the time, just hoping you finally stumble onto your next objective before you throw your controller and say &#8220;screw it, this game sucks&#8221;.  There&#8217;s also a bit of walking in the dark.  I especially enjoyed these areas of the game where it was so dark on the screen I could barely see anything at all.  The walking experiences I had there were particularly memorable.  I can honestly say that I have never experienced a game quite like Killzone Shadowfall where so much loving devotion was given to recreating (to the last detail) the entire experience of being a pedestrian.So if you like trekking through large empty spaces completely alone and desperately searching for an enemy (or even TWO!) that you can finally kill, and you can&#8217;t stand too much action in your first person shooters-Killzone Shadow fall is your launch game of choice this holiday season.For the rest of you odd ball types who actually want some action and intrigue in your first person shooters, do yourself a HUGE favor and skip this piece of Hellghast spawned dog s*** and pick up the Killzone collection for PS3 instead.  Even KZ1-dated as is it is still an enormously more fun game to play than Shadowfall.If Guerilla games wants to take the Killzone series in this new direction for PS4 this generation-that&#8217;s fine.  Count me out though.  Call me crazy, but I still like to have &#8220;fun&#8221; when I play videogames, not just look at pretty eye candy as I&#8217;m traipsing along the countryside with no one around and nothing at all to do.  Oh, I forgot-the inclusion of the new OWL is pretty cool though.  So there&#8217;s that I guess.  Shadowfall was easily my number one choice of launch games.  Of the three PS4 launch games I&#8217;ve played now, Shadow fall ranks dead last with a bullet.

looks gorgous, boring shooter.
I, too, was excited about Spore until I heard about the DRM. That's a dealbreaker.
I don't get the love for this game.  "Lame" is what they should call it.
A Bad game that appears to be a great one..

Let me start by saying I have PS4.  I had Xbox 360 and played Borderlands 2 extensively. Loved it... so much that I bought the PS Vita , case, etc..to play it again. First off..its on a 5&#34; screen. They shrunk the original size down ..so now all small print is even smaller!  But you learn to live with it...no longer on a 65&#34; screen...but 5&#34;.  Its the glitches or bugs in the system or software.  I also bought Unit 13 which played well...no glitches...so I would say its in the software.  Glitches: The turret automatically deploys when charged up...grenades are thrown even though I haven't even equipped it yet (theonly way to stop throwing grenades was to drop them or sell them. Then theres the vehicles... wow!  The brakes seem to be on all the time.. control is wild..like driving on ice!  then its the view...while trying to shoot the view flips from front to back ...through options I THINK I finally have the vehicle dialed in...then in combat forward is now backward...while sliding all over...view changes erratically.  I gave up.  Tomorrow Wolfenstein arrives for the PS4. Cant wait to get back on the big screen with normal controls.  It appears Gearbox has rushed through a conversion for the ps Vita ..meanwhile we suffer.
Puke, why calm this socom? It's more like Seth Luisi's incest love child with 2 left thumbs. Buy a ps4 in Jan 2015 and pick up H-Hour from Sof Studios. David Spears, one of the original creators of Socom I and II from Zipper, launched this concept on Kickstarter and will be ready for release in feb 2015! G^ noobs
This game is great on ps4 because it is 1080, but it is only 720 on xbox one.So go buy a ps4 for this game
I feel like EA did something special with the last Medal of Honor game in breaking away from the &#34;Call of Duty&#34; or &#34;Battlefield&#34; mold.  I felt like they made a good game with a thoughtful, well-written story.This game, to me, doesn't feel like so much of a continuation of what they had done in the prior title.  This game feels like they &#34;buckled&#34; a bit, and tried to build this game moreso in the &#34;Call of Duty&#34; or &#34;Battlefield&#34; mold, and to me (for the Medal of Honor series) that's not a good thing.If someone wants to play &#34;Call of Duty&#34; or &#34;Battlefield&#34; , then they should purchase &#34;Call of Duty&#34; or &#34;Battlefield&#34;.  EA should have stuck to their conviction, and made another good, story-driven game instead of trying to create a &#34;Call of Duty&#34; and &#34;Battlefield&#34; challenger.&#34;Call of Duty&#34;  and &#34;Battlefield&#34; are good games that have their own identity, are what they are, and do what it is that they do better than anyone else.  I felt like they gave Medal of Honor a unique identity with the last game and did something a bit differently than the other &#34;First Person Shooter&#34; titles on the market today, but they lost that identity with this game.It's not good and it's not terrible, but it just doesn't stand out and find it's own voice like the last game did.  And because of that, it's just become another &#34;Bargain Bin&#34; &#34;First Person Shooter&#34; gameI didn't care for it, but since it only cost me around $ 10 here, on Amazon, I didn't take a huge gamble, and wasn't out much either.  I would have been very disappointed had I spent $ 60 on this game.There are a lot of parentheses in this review.
It's pretty simple, here. Ultima games only became worth purchasing beginning with Ultima 7. So you want three games if want old-school Ultima: Ultima 7, Ultima 7 Serpents Isle, and Ultima 8. The rest of the titles are just garbage, and that they want to charge a fortune for them now is just laughable. Is anybody really buying this? And will your PC even play the older titles? And would you even want it to? They're bad. I mean, really, really, bad.This is a nostalgia purchase, nothing more. It is to witness the evolution of RPG gaming, but definitely not to empty your bank account doing it.Ultima 7 and Ultima 7 Serpents Isle are still great fun to play; Ultima 8? A little less so, mostly because it is smaller in scope. This is where the Baldur's Gate Series began, which eventually spawned the Elder Scroll Games, so there is an historical component. Still, it's just not worth this price. I might pay ten bucks or so to play these titles again (maybe). Yeah, maybe.

I rented this yesterday for a 3-year-old, figuring the music and graphics would be something she'd enjoy.Imagine my chagrin when the game came on and there was NO SOUND.  I poked and prodded and looked for options, but couldn't find any indication of why it didn't work.Someone online had the answer for me:  for whatever reason, the producers of this game elected not to include a digital audio out sound track.It's a music game.  Hello?My PS2 is integrated into my home theatre system--to maximize performance, it's hooked up with a component video cable and an optical digital audio cable. If your system is hooked up in a similar way, you will not hear the audio for this game without reconfiguring your PS2 hookup.On my system, a bad design choice makes this game unplayable.  Zero stars.

... are both ridiculous. Seriously, two stars for naming your game &#34;Warfighter&#34; and then releasing it with that name. Almost as good as &#34;Wardriving&#34;.
I bought this game for my ps4 ! I ran home put the disc in and guess what it says ps4 cant display the game I must set my settings to 720p to be able to see the game ? Wow why does this game only support 720p and not 1080p its 2014 ! So I seen this VCR sitting on my stand which I tried to insert a VHS tape and its said it cant support 180p i looked closer and the VCR is a XBOX ONE brand name it says the kinetic needs a patch to be able to support 180p and it will be upscale so no more watching my moms old 70s porn tapes :( The controller even uses batteries just like the one from my moms 1980 VCR wow this XBOX ONE must be a throw back just like the 80's .... You can even use it like a VCR to play cable shows on so innovated for 2014 ..... GOD I LOVE MY PS4

Review update  1/23/13So I had the Two Towers game for Gamecube back when it first came out in 2002 and I loved it, and played the ass out of it.  But by the time this one came out, I had either lost interest or couldn't be bothered to spend money on buying it.Where the previous game was smooth, streamlined, and somewhat tempered in its hacking n slashing so that hacking and slashing half a dozen opponents was overwhelming yet rewarding in a way that some hack n slashes do with half a hundred opponents in the same time.  It had the original voice actors playing themselves, even unlockable interviews with them talking about it and their recording.  It even had incentives to replay levels using each character over again.Nine years later, I returned to the games, and played this one.Everything about the previous game that was good seems to be completely and thoroughly wasted or rendered useless in this game.The graphics are somewhat improved for the characters, but the drab color scheme (a questionable decision given that this game covers more areas and different characters) and stunningly awful enemy designs mean that while you could easily discern Orcs from Goblins from Uruk-Hai, including the big orcs who were like Uruk-Hai, and the incredibly annoying Uruk-Hai with no shirt who would always knock you down with his one-handed sword, in this game you can almost never tell the difference (if there even is any) between the various types of Orc.Adding to the monotony of the color is perhaps the most mind-numbingly awful methods of ramping up gameplay difficulty from the previous game.  Virtually every bad game design decision that could be implemented here was implemented;- The camera positioning is hideous and you frequently end up being unable to see your own character for long periods of time, or running headlong against the side of the screen, only to be suddenly attacked at the last moment by a horde of enemies you were apparently charging straight into blindly.Some specific examples include the wall battle of Minas Tirith, a pretty blatant copy of the wall battle of Helms Deep from the previous game, only this time with you as Gandalf and with constant annoying little secondary objectives that give the enemy far too much time to swarm the wall, such as rushing to catapults to fire on enemy siege towers, despite them ALREADY HAVING TEAMS OF MEN AT THE CATAPULTS FULLY CAPABLE OF PULLING THE SWITCH TO FIRE.  The camera angling is so terrible that you can never actually see the staircase you're supposed to walk up to find the catapults.  The game never even hints how you get to them, and it was literally only dumb luck that I found the camera shifted when I reached a certain blind spot, showing me these stairs.Another horrendous example comes when Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli arrive on Pelennor Fields, and must go through a gauntlet of taking out Oliphaunts one at a time.  Aside from the afore-mentioned face-palming stupidity exercise that this is, the game constantly goes to cut scene to show you the arrival of each and every single new Oliphaunt, as well as the Witch-King arriving, thus leaving your character frozen in place while random Uruks and Eastern Men swarm your position; if you had virtually no health (and you almost certainly will) you pretty much instantly die as soon as the cutscene is done.  And the way the cutscene is shot makes it difficult to tell which side of a massive canyon you should be on in order to shoot at the Oliphaunt.- Ridiculous difficulty levels involving health and damage.  At the very least for this game, you can purchase combo and weapon upgrades that apply to ALL characters rather than you own, with a discount to offer incentive toward this while having a need to keep upping your best characters to meet future challenges.  Despite this, difficulty isn't raised by having smarter opponents or tougher battles, but simply by lowering your health drastically and lowering your weapon damage drastically, then by doubling the amount of enemies thrown at you.Whereas the previous game's health bar was well balanced with its green for good, yellow for mildly damaged, orange for seriously damaged, and red for near-death, and a good player almost always managing to keep yellow or better, no amount of skill will keep players from spending more than half the time in red health, bordering on dying.  This wouldn't be so frustrating if not for the fact that the game seemingly doesn't expect this, and thus has the health bar constantly FLASHING at the bottom of the screen when you're in red.This is exacerbated by incredibly bad combos.  Despite using some of the same button sequences as the previous game, combos here are poorly executed, with some of the most important ones being so slow in execution that they only work against an opponent one on one; if there is a second opponent, he need only shove you roughly to completely break the combo and send you staggering back.  This means combos are as likely to fail as they are to work properly, and even worse, don't do enough damage to kill most of the time; when there's few, if any combos that allow for sweeping attacks or splash damage, knocking one opponent down for a second before moving on to another is just as much a waste of time as simply mashing A repeatedly, with the exact same results achieved.At the very least, you can block attacks with your attack instead of having to press B constantly (though this works best).  And even worse is being knocked down; unlike the previous game, when you're knocked down by ANYTHING (be it a gargantuan Orc champion, a troll, or a dog-sized spider) you stay down for 3 full seconds, unmoving, and take another 2-3 seconds just getting up.  In the midst of fast-hack-n-slash gameplay, particularly in the Pelennor Fields where 6 seconds is long enough to miss your chance to kill the Oliphaunt and spook the Witch King away from Merry and Eowyn, this is deadly, not to mention a colossal waste of time with regards to action.  I cannot even imagine how this decision to make rising such a sluggish action was considered and implemented unless there's a future upgrade to speed up rising time (though about 50% of the way into the game, it's not anywhere to be seen).- Long-winded missions with multiple sub-objectives and poorly spaced out checkpoints.This section alone topples the entire game, in my opinion.  It is absolutely gamebreaking and the true definition of "an exercise in face-palming stupidity"The Two Towers' missions were typically lengthy, with frequent checkpoints and clear-cut objectives, like "Kill 40 Uruk-Hai, run this way to protect Frodo, kill 10 Uruk-Hai, kill Uruk boss", it was mostly about rushing through maze-like levels, killing, doing stuff, killing, and boss fights.Here, they implement so many sections that in some cases bring the gameplay to a screeching halt so you can try and fail over and over to figure out their completely pointless little puzzle section, or try and fail over and over as they throw complicated objectives on top of being swarmed by hundreds of opponents.Some of the absolute worst examples include:Samwise in Shelob's lair.  There are little sections that serve absolutely no purpose except to waste time, in which Sam has to pick up a conveniently placed torch and throw it in the middle of a pile of little spiders in order to clear them from his path.  Rather than just using it once or twice to teach us to use the Z button for interactions, they implement it as a primary level feature, and there's literally one section where you have to do it three times in a row to reach a locked door, only to realize YOU HAVE TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN GOING BACK WHERE YOU STARTED in order to climb up past ANOTHER series of spiders and torches.The Big Three in the Ghost lair.  More than once, you're forced to button-mash the Z button to turn a wheel that lowers a bridge while ghostly archers shoot at you, balancing between deflecting their arrows and working on the bridge.  Not only is this so easy that you could just stand there as half the arrows simply glitch past you due to piss-poor collision detection, but sometimes a cutscene showing the bridge lowering wastes several seconds.Other times, the game simply demands ridiculously over the top objectives and gives you literally nothing to work with.  In these circumstances, even lowering the difficulty does nothing to change the impenetrable grind in some of these levels.  The design is not one of any sort of challenge or skill or talent, but literally face-palming stupidity and repetition until you finally overcome the odds by sheer statistics.  It's the very action of the saying "the definition of insanity is doing the exact same thing over and over and expecting different results".  And unlike the previous game, your allies are completely and utterly useless; they will never ever successfully kill more than one enemy in the time you've taken out five or six or more and moved on.  Sometimes they won't even attack, but just stand still in front of an enemy until that enemy decides to ignore them and attack you.Some of the worst offenders include the aforementioned level in the Ghost cave, where you inexplicably have to fight some ghosts.  Random rocks will burst out of the ground, blocking your progress until you defeat a bunch of ghosts somehow.  As well, if you get too close to the ghosts, they can pretty much insta-kill you, sending you right the hell back to the start of the level or the start of the checkpoint.  There's literally nothing you can do to avoid this but try again and do the exact same thing over again.Similarly, the aforementioned Pelennor Fields gauntlet of "I have to do everything because everyone else is too effing stupid" tasks, in which to start, you have to kill 60 east men, but not Orcs.  I specifically say not Orcs, because they don't count towards the 60, and because there's as many of them on the field as there are east men.  Why east men only instead of Orcs, no effing idea why, since the overall objective means you could be fighting wild deer or gremlins or inanimate objects and the result as well as the task would be exactly the same; killing these 60 eastermen doesn't matter at all; the respawn infinitesimally and after you finish this pointless objective, you move on to the real mission.And this "warm up" isn't even vital to the actual mission; you could literally just run past the field and set up camp on the cliffs overlooking the canyon where the Oliphaunts spawn, but the combination of pointless objective and incredibly awful camera angling means you're literally lost in the fray and have no idea where to even go once you've finished the objective.And the sheer number of Orcs and East Men spawned and thrown at you in this phase makes it so difficult that it should be in some way relevant; I've died and had to restart so often in this spot, I could have finished entire levels of this same long-winded game in the amount of time I spent dealing with flimsy combos which left me wide open to attack by the 50,000 other enemies surrounding me, being knocked over long enough for another 50,000 to trample me, and spending so much time with red blinking health on the brink of death while mashing B to block 50,000 blades all attacking me that I could reach Perfect Mode two times over just from the blocks, and have no avenue open to even attack anyone!  ALL of those events (aside from the obvious number exaggeration) happened to me in this one effing level!!!And the punchline is; this isn't the first time you're put in such a situation.  An earlier level has the exact same setup; you randomly thrown into a random spot of battlefield with endless swarms of Orcs spawning on you, and half an hour spent blocking and killing them by the score, with no end in sight, and no mission objective in sight.  Unlike the Pelennor Fields one where you at least saw it would end after killing 60 East Men, this level (forgot which) had NO such objective, and NO clue or insight into what you were supposed to be doing!IF you survived long enough, the mission would end up failing anyway because apparently you were supposed to go and rescue someone while fighting through the Orcs.  This WOULD have made sense if the Orcs were actually IN BETWEEN YOU AND THE THING YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO REACH.  Instead, they're literally on the EXACT OPPOSITE SIDE, so the way to complete this objective is not to fight your way through the Orcs, but to COMPLETELY IGNORE THEM AND RUN AWAY.  And you only learn this AFTER being killed half a dozen times or having the mission abruptly fail with absolutely no explanation as to why.Back to the Pelennor Fields level, another layer of insanity/stupidity comes with the Witch King; he randomly appears to fly over Eowyn and Merry and apparently do nothing.  They take damage, but the Witch King neither attacks them nor shoots arrows or spears or magic at them.  You're supposed to shoot arrows at him to make him fly away.  Not only does this occur while the Oliphaunts still come (and taking them down is a tedium all in itself) but if the Oliphaunts make it to Eowyn and Merry, you instantly fail the mission, and the amount of time it takes to move from different locations and fire off arrows means that there are some cases where it is genuinely not possible to win the mission, because you missed out by a second or less getting up after being knocked down, and either the Witch King or an Oliphaunt kills Merry and Eowyn.And making it even more catastrophically infuriating is that Orcs and East Men KEEP SPAWNING THIS WHOLE TIME and they KEEP rushing at you to attack you!  So sometimes you don't even need to be just a bit too slow; you could be distracted by them rushing you, wasting your time, while the Oliphaunt trudges closer, or the Witch King kills off Eowyn and Merry.And this literally happens to me every time: When I try to target the Witch King to shoot arrows at him, ONE enemy soldier spots me and rushes at me... and my bow's targetting targets HIM instead of the Witch King, and thus far I've found absolutely nothing short of completely putting the bow away and killing him that will serve to take the bow's aim OFF the goddamn bat and ON the goddamn Witch King.At this rate, it seems impossible for the game to present anything that could lift it out of this mad mess of pointless wall-banging repetition and stupidity.  It's become for me the go-to guide on how not to make an action game.  Despite the playable gameplay elements for hacking and slashing, unless you want to move past stage 1, you're SOL.

An earlier level has the exact same setup; you randomly thrown into a random spot of battlefield with endless swarms of Orcs spawning on you, and half an hour spent blocking and killing them by the score, with no end in sight, and no mission objective in sight.  Unlike the Pelennor Fields one where you at least saw it would end after killing 60 East Men, this level (forgot which) had NO such objective, and NO clue or insight into what you were supposed to be doing!IF you survived long enough, the mission would end up failing anyway because apparently you were supposed to go and rescue someone while fighting through the Orcs.  This WOULD have made sense if the Orcs were actually IN BETWEEN YOU AND THE THING YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO REACH.  Instead, they're literally on the EXACT OPPOSITE SIDE, so the way to complete this objective is not to fight your way through the Orcs, but to COMPLETELY IGNORE THEM AND RUN AWAY.  And you only learn this AFTER being killed half a dozen times or having the mission abruptly fail with absolutely no explanation as to why.Back to the Pelennor Fields level, another layer of insanity/stupidity comes with the Witch King; he randomly appears to fly over Eowyn and Merry and apparently do nothing.  They take damage, but the Witch King neither attacks them nor shoots arrows or spears or magic at them.  You're supposed to shoot arrows at him to make him fly away.  Not only does this occur while the Oliphaunts still come (and taking them down is a tedium all in itself) but if the Oliphaunts make it to Eowyn and Merry, you instantly fail the mission, and the amount of time it takes to move from different locations and fire off arrows means that there are some cases where it is genuinely not possible to win the mission, because you missed out by a second or less getting up after being knocked down, and either the Witch King or an Oliphaunt kills Merry and Eowyn.And making it even more catastrophically infuriating is that Orcs and East Men KEEP SPAWNING THIS WHOLE TIME and they KEEP rushing at you to attack you!  So sometimes you don't even need to be just a bit too slow; you could be distracted by them rushing you, wasting your time, while the Oliphaunt trudges closer, or the Witch King kills off Eowyn and Merry.And this literally happens to me every time: When I try to target the Witch King to shoot arrows at him, ONE enemy soldier spots me and rushes at me... and my bow's targetting targets HIM instead of the Witch King, and thus far I've found absolutely nothing short of completely putting the bow away and killing him that will serve to take the bow's aim OFF the goddamn bat and ON the goddamn Witch King.At this rate, it seems impossible for the game to present anything that could lift it out of this mad mess of pointless wall-banging repetition and stupidity.  It's become for me the go-to guide on how not to make an action game.  Despite the playable gameplay elements for hacking and slashing, unless you want to move past stage 1, you're SOL.
What a generic title. Given the game, that's par for the course. The Legend of Dragoon is certainly the most generic game I've played on the Playstation. It's sort of sad, in many ways, that it was released by SCEA only months before Chrono Cross and Final Fantasy IX, and over a year after Final Fantasy VIII.What's generic about it? Damn near everything. The main character is a spiky-haired blonde dude whose small village is destroyed by an evil empire, and who is designated the "chosen one" by a pendant, previously possessed by a mysterious stranger. Can you even name how many other games that borrows from? Do numbers go that high? And I forgot to mention, his representative color is red. Of course, the empire is still on the prowl, and Dart has to chase them with a diverse group of heroes.And that's not even touching the translation- The Legend of Dragoon boasts some truly embarrassing translation errors. Square learned this lesson after Final Fantasy VII, which took a lot of flack for its stereotypes and writing, but that game had an interesting setting and strong enough characters to make up for it. The Legend of Dragoon wasn't just several years behind, it was at least two games behind by PS1 jRPG standards.While the story is generic and perfunctory, it's not really the problem. Let's talk about the combat. The Legend of Dragoon's basis for combat is a series of timed button presses known as "additions." When one chooses the attack option, a reticle focuses in on the enemy, and a button must be pressed to time with the animation. While this basic idea has been done in other games, like Vagrant Story, Final Fantasy VIII, and the Mario and Luigi series, The Legend of Dragoon makes it the core of combat, and that's a fatal error. While timed button presses were integral to the games I mentioned, the important thing is that they didn't slow down the combat. The Legend of Dragoon's combat forces you to do this chain of animations every time you click attack, and when you miss, you get to see your character freeze in place as a number appears only once in front of the enemy. Random encounters, which are the majority of the game in RPGs, take forever and feel clunky. The Dragoon transformations- a flashy sequence comparable to Power Rangers- are also longer than necessary and the Dragoon attacks do little to change my complaints about the rest of the game.The look of the game is very generic as well. While the pre-rendered backgrounds of the game look fine, the character models outside of combat are simplistic and poorly animated. The in-combat look is marginally better, and while the Dragoon transformations look good, the default character models aren't very detailed, and neither are the enemies. The combat environments look especially poor- many of the floors and walls are a single polygon with a blocky texture applied to it.As far as I'm concerned, the great-looking cinematics don't count when we're talking about graphics, though it is worth noting that the ones in The Legend of Dragoon look great. But you might as well jump on youtube and watch all of them instead of playing the game, or rent Advent Children or The Spirits Within, or Shrek for that matter, if that's all you care about. The art design of the game doesn't lend itself to Playstation's technology.I hesitate to speculate on matters like this, but The Legend of Dragoon strikes me as an attempt by Sony to cash in after the success of Final Fantasy VII. The game looks an awful lot like that game, with a fantasy setting substituted for a steam/cyberpunk one. I wouldn't call that an improvement.

Catwoman is one of those games that gives licensed properties a bad name-something really depressing as movie-based titles were starting to gain respectability with The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay and Spider-Man 2. No, Catwoman fumbles the ball-from the moment you press start there's nothing but frustration. You play as Patience, a woman left for dead, but instead of pushing up daisies, she's revived/saved/resurrected by cats. Somehow her small furry saviors imbue her with cat-powers (or something like that), which translate into a limited repertoire of flailing punch-kick moves, expertise with a whip, and other purchasable powers that are available as the game progresses. Catwoman commits every action-adventure platform-jumper crime imaginable: lousy camera angles, incomprehensible level designs, and a lame combat engine. And for an agile character, there's really nothing stealthy about her: enemies mindlessly charge, and no matter how you slice it, one really shouldn't have to spend endless hours trying to repeatedly make a near-impossible jump. The awkward controls don't help much, either. Actions are primarily limited to the triggers and analog sticks, and combat is an infuriating visual mess thanks to the camera that has a mind of its own. Unfortunately, Catwoman will surface on store shelves before this review appears. Too bad: unaware purchasers of this title will probably quickly relegate it to the litter box.

Legend of Dragoon is one of those games that you either love or despise, I of course belong to the later group.As one reviewer already mentioned, Legend of Dragoon was Sony's answer to rival Square-Enix's insanely popular Final Fantasy VII. I have to laugh when it took them three years to cook up this title that can't even dent the Final Fantasy fanchise.I don't think the Final Fantasy series is the greatest thing since sliced bread (I actually like the Wild Arms series the most), but the only thing Legend of Dragoon really had going for it was its graphics, which I will admit where pretty sweet at the time.Outside the graphical engine, Legend of Dragoon is second rate RPG in every category. Lame enemies, lackluster story, generic locations, and some of the worst music to ever accompany an PSX RPG ever (it's really that bad). Fights are also annoying due to the so-called "Additions" system which has you doing timed hits all day (yeah, that's what I call fun when I have to hit a button 8 times in a row at just the correct moment just to attack).Other problems also arise, such as the fact no one can use magic outside of their dragoon transformations, meaning their is really no way to heal your characters except for items (which you become way too dependent on in this game, and can only carry so many). Outside the dragoon tranformations the battle system is very weak.Play Legend of Dragoon only after you have destroyed every other PSX PRG. By that time you'll realize that this is not what any and all PSX RPG's should be compared against. Even if Final Fantasy is extremely overrated at times, even the worst FF is better than this. I don't think I'll play this one again.

"Jet Li: Rise to Honor" is a third person brawling and shooting game. In the game, the player takes the role of Jet Li - or rather, a character virtually portrayed by him.The story is a fairly simple, revolving around Chinese gangs and criminal elements. Jet Li - or the player - is Kit Yun, a bodyguard responsible for protecting Boss Chiang, who is attempting to leave his life of crime behind. Most of the story involves beating up other gang members who are trying to kill Chiang or, later, his daughter, and the story serves mostly as an excuse for this violence.The gameplay is simple compared to many other brawler games: aside from guarding and area-specific actions, fighting occurs by pushing ("slapping", in the game's words) the right control stick in the direction that you want to attack. This allows for multidirectional attacking in the game's many multi-opponent fights. This simplifies combat almost to the point where it's not fun anymore; the only other action is "adrenaline attacks", which is basically slow motion or bullet time. Gun battles work roughly the same way, except the control stick is used to target and the R2 button is used to shoot. Apart from some neat interactive features, like kicking people into equipment or onto hot stoves, there isn't a lot of gameplay variety.The graphics are decent, but not good. Faces are reasonably good, but also tend to be blocky. The textures range from mediocre to poor, with too much blur and not enough detail. The action, despite some neat slow-motion moments, is generally lackluster as well. The sound is for the most part forgettable and consists mainly of yelling in Chinese."Mediocre" describes this game fairly well. At most parts, it simply drags as you are forced to fight yet another wave of hooded thugs, and it lacks excitement and panache.4/10.

I love RPGs. The PS2 has produced some really excellent games for the genre including Final Fantasy X, the Shadow Hearts series, and Disgea: Hour of Darkness. Wild Arms 3 is not going to be joining this list of RPG awesomeness any time soon. It's not even going to be joining my list of decent RPGs. This game is terrible, and I just could not finish it! Trust me I tried and there was a period of two weeks when I couldn't bring myself to even turn the game on.I thought a western-themed RPG would be something really unique, but I was wrong. This has got to be one of the most cliched things I've ever seen. It's the third in a series that appears to be rather popular. I did end up hating this game, but strangely I'm not totally put off from playing a Wild Arms game ever again. Maybe since this is the third game, it's just an unfortunate casuality of sequel-itis.The Good:The music's pretty good. It's appropriately whistlely and twangy like the fare you'd find in most spagetti westerns and really sets the western tone.Fighting on horseback! This only unique from a visual point of view. The game still plays in exactly the same turn-based Final Fantasy-esque way as if you were on foot, but it looks really cool as you race across the desert fending off creepies.Save Anywhere! You can provided you have an item called a Gimel Coin, but luckily those are easy to find.The Bad:Cliched plot. It starts out with promise. Your four heroes meet up during a train robbery when some burly gunmen try to steal an artifact belonging to this Indian Shaman tribe called the Baskars. Classic Western! Then the adventurers, called Drifters, team up and take an assignment from the Baskar's head Shaman to awaken the four guardians of the planet Filgaia so maybe the desertification of the planet will stop. It's down hill from there. Suddenly, instead of a Western game, I'm playing a cliched find the four scared elemental crystals/dragons/betamax VCRs quest.... but with firearms! Soon our foursome discovers that this weird demon cult is out to infuse the planet with evil energy and transform it into a demon world or some other rot by using guardians and ancient artifacts. So they set out, to discover why Filgaia is dying and play follow-the-bad guys. It's almost like playing Final Fantasy VII over again, and I never liked that game much in the first place.Characters that come right out of anime central casting. The characters are very archetypal and never try to break out of their mold. You have Gallows, a ne'er-do-well Shaman, who learns some bland lesson on freedom, heritage, and self-actualization on the journey. Brainy, tough guy Clive, who might have been a better drawn character if his marital troubles were explored in more detail. Jet Enduro, surly anti-social amnesiac, and worst of the bunch Virginia Maxwell. For some reason they make her their leader even though she is the least expirenced of the bunch. She's naive, gulliable, and not all that smart trusting people she should know better than to trust and walking into obvious traps. She's one of those annoyingly perky types and her "Come on guys! Let's do our best for Justice, Truth, and blah blah" is more Big Bird than Clint Eastwood. She's also looking for the dead-beat dad she hasn't seen in 10 years. The anime feel is helped along by the video sequences (complete with corny songs) that sandwich the game when you begin and end it during each period of play. Trust me. It's frickk'n annoying after you've seen them ten times.Sandcraft battles. During the game you get a sandcraft vehicle. If you run into a monster in this thing, the way the battles plays out is very different than on foot or horseback. That's not good because they battles are so bloody slow that they can last for over five minutes each!The Ugly:Healing Items are hard to find. Healing Items are scarce, so it becomes neccesary to ration stretigically. There are some sections of the game that are so hard that having a big cache of heal berries is the only way to stay alive. It adds challenge, but since I didn't enjoy the game it just it that more annoying.Search system. If you want to find something on the map, you need to get directions first and move slowly across the map sending out some kind of sonar to make the ruin, town, or whatever appear. It's time consuming and also makes the game extremely linear.Boring Level Design. You'll send more of you're time trekking through the various ruins that litter the landscape. In the ruins, you solve various puzzles ranging from easy to what am I supposed to do here? difficulty. A critic once said level design was key, and Wild Arms 3 makes me see how right he was. All the ruins look exactly the same. I know I'm throwing a switch in the ruin in the North, but I did the exact same thing in the ruin to the South which also had a box puzzle like the ruin in the West.  Get my point? It feels like I'm doing the same thing over and over again. I'm not traveling to a Forest of Doom or a Cloud City of Eternal Happiness. It's just ruins and towns, and they all look the same!

The game starts off with an intersting opending and quickly goes down hill from there. As soon as Jak opens his mouth to speak, I began to have my doubts. Everything he says he is nasty and his vocal tones are those of the nastiest villians. Granted he is supposed to be under the influence of dark forces and he is grumpy from two years of torture, but still he sounds more like a stock villian then a hero whose fate you are supposed to care about it.The level designs are also unrelentedly difficult. From the very beginning you are faced with challenging moving platforms and with a couple of levels you will be chased by a relentless cannon while jumping blind repeatedly. Poor camera angles, lack of camera control in crucial areas, make already difficult jumps nearly impossible as judging depth is often not possible  and more often then not you are forced to jump blind because you can not see where you need to go next.Rarely is there is no time to pause to study your move and try to rotate the camera (which at some crucial spots simply refuses to budge) because crumbling ledges, firing cannons and their ilk force you to keep hopping from one awkward ledge to the next. You will be forced to endless repeat difficult segements, memorizing the exact route as you will often need to jump blind in order to complete levels. Finely you make it through a difficult segement only to fall off a tiny ledge that lures you off the side by tempting goodies, or shot by an unseen gun, only to be sent bake to the beginning, forced to repeat what you thought mastered until you eyes blur over and you forget why it is you are playing the game. Only sheer stuborness will force you to continue.When you are not being frustrated by the pooly paced and un-balanced levels, you will be bored by the endless travel by foot or awkward vehicals that you can steal, needed to get between levels, which the game refers to as missions. This aspect of the game might have been amusing as a single section but is otherwise pointless. The vehicals can only be flown at two heights and there is little room to manuver. Everyone just bangs into everyone else. It is like an endless game of bumper cars to get from one place to the other.Eventually, if you persist, you will realize that both the level difficulty and endless crisscrossings of the hub city to get to each level are only there to pad out what otherwise be a very brief game. It's a shame really, because the story is interesting, the levels bright and intriguing and with just a bit of tuning could have been really fun rather then really frustrating. If ND really wanted to be innovative, there would have a variable level of difficulity and maturity settings. As it is this game will only appeal to the teenager or adult who finds most platforms a piece of cake and longs for a real challenge.
The game starts off with an intersting opending and quickly goes down hill from there. As soon as Jak opens his mouth to speak, I began to have my doubts. Everything he says he is nasty and his vocal tones are those of the nastiest villians. Granted he is supposed to be under the influence of dark forces and he is grumpy from two years of torture, but still he sounds more like a stock villian then a hero whose fate you are supposed to care about it.The level designs are also unrelentedly difficult. From the very beginning you are faced with challenging moving platforms and with a couple of levels you will be chased by a relentless cannon while jumping blind repeatedly. Poor camera angles, lack of camera control in crucial areas, make already difficult jumps nearly impossible as judging depth is often not possible  and more often then not you are forced to jump blind because you can not see where you need to go next.Rarely is there is no time to pause to study your move and try to rotate the camera (which at some crucial spots simply refuses to budge) because crumbling ledges, firing cannons and their ilk force you to keep hopping from one awkward ledge to the next. You will be forced to endless repeat difficult segements, memorizing the exact route as you will often need to jump blind in order to complete levels. Finely you make it through a difficult segement only to fall off a tiny ledge that lures you off the side by tempting goodies, or shot by an unseen gun, only to be sent bake to the beginning, forced to repeat what you thought mastered until you eyes blur over and you forget why it is you are playing the game. Only sheer stuborness will force you to continue.When you are not being frustrated by the pooly paced and un-balanced levels, you will be bored by the endless travel by foot or awkward vehicals that you can steal, needed to get between levels, which the game refers to as missions. This aspect of the game might have been amusing as a single section but is otherwise pointless. The vehicals can only be flown at two heights and there is little room to manuver. Everyone just bangs into everyone else. It is like an endless game of bumper cars to get from one place to the other.Eventually, if you persist, you will realize that both the level difficulty and endless crisscrossings of the hub city to get to each level are only there to pad out what otherwise be a very brief game. It's a shame really, because the story is interesting, the levels bright and intriguing and with just a bit of tuning could have been really fun rather then really frustrating. If ND really wanted to be innovative, there would have a variable level of difficulity and maturity settings. As it is this game will only appeal to the teenager or adult who finds most platforms a piece of cake and longs for a real challenge.
Any enjoyment you might derive from this game is from playing as Jet Li in an old-school fight setting.  When the novelty of that wears off, what you have left is an incredibly repetitive game with a godawful camera and an ill-advised control scheme.Yes, bonus marks are in order for using Cantonese in Hong Kong with subtitles.  (As a native Hong Kong person I can say the dialogue is less stilted than usual, though still flawed)  Though I might add that international espionage games like Syphon Filter has been doing that for years.  The settings are authentic enough, with the battles in the Hong Kong settings being especially evocative of kung fu films.But is it worth the very problematic gameplay?  Just barely.  If you've seen/played the demo already, you'll know that the entire fight system consists of slapping the right analog stick.  While the array of moves you can unleash is impressive, motion-captured well from Li's own silhouette, this system is very ill conceived from a fighting-game perspective.  Worse still, the camera is so restless that you could be in the middle of a combo against an enemy, and then the perspective shifts so that you're suddenly hitting at air and the enemy's to the side.  So many game designers have misled notions about being filmmakers, not realizing that the best perspective for gaming is a fixed perspective.  This problem came to a head during the ludicrous "escape from capture" stage where the camera actually cuts you off, preventing you from seeing what's behind you, even though there are guards sweeping flashlights that way that you're supposed to avoid!  This is simply a moronic use of the camera.Aside from this, the fighting gets tired awfully quickly, especially since the designers committed the ol' "this level never ends" sin.  This game alleviates this problem by having lots of checkpoints where you can continue the game, but during some of the "one against 14" stages, the endless brawling still gets tired.  And whose idea was it to have enemies pull off 18-hit combos, where if you get hit the first time, you get to watch your character get pummelled for 10 seconds straight?I actually find the gunfight segments of this game more fun than the endless, endless hand-to-hand stages.  This is where the dual analog sticks truly shine, allowing you to smoothly run from spot to spot forwards and backwards while your hands can aim independently and a top button allows you to do Time Crisis-style ducking.  There's even a crazy level where you fight off about 100 enemies with two nailguns!This game would probably remain tempting to Jet Li fans because of the role-playing aspect of it.  And I wouldn't blame them -- this was my reason for buying this game, and there are a few levels that I truly enjoyed.  The overall game, however, is really not that great, and I would recommend only playing it in small doses.  It will get tired mightily quickly if you sit with it for more than an hour.

The Medal of Honor games have always been great.  Until now.  This game should be a free download for anyone who still has Frontline.  It is short and the AI, as far as I can tell, is actually worse than in the previous game.  The &quot;Pacific Battlefield&quot; looks like a sandwich made out of doo-doo brown and mud.  Real pretty it is.  I couldn't tell much difference in the scenery from being down in a Phillipine sewer and running free on the beachhead (sp?)  The gameplay is a little tedious, as well.Maybe it is a good rental...This is worth about $10 +/-.If you pay $50 for this then I have a broken 32x for the Sega Genesis with no cables for just $200.  That's cash only, and this is a one-time offer.  Send all payments to:Raoul Drake515 Pensacola Hooker Ave.Shattaboulasuchi, LA 99999999-9999.Stay sober!

who is giving this good reviews? This has to be the worst RPG on PS1. Interestingly, Sony initially believed that JRPGs wouldnt sell well in the west, and they released japanese games only if they were action/ arcade games. This was the first JRPG released, and it was something of a surprise "hit". Its strong sales showed that there was a ready western market for JRPGs and led to the later high profile releases of classic rpgs such as final fantasy 7 and breath of fire 4.Like many PS1 owners at that time, I eagerly anticipated this game, hoping for an epic experience similar to final fantasy 6 on the SNES, but with incredible PSX graphics lol. Instead I got this horrible rubbish. Its completely generic with no personality whatsoever and includes every RPG cliche there is. Its extremely easy, with extremely simple mechanics, and also very long and tedious with endless dull battles.

This game shows off the PS2's graphical prowess, or what passes for graphical prowess on a PS2.  The controls are very easy to pick up, and if you don't demand anything from your games then this will probably satisfy you.  However, I found that collecting power cells and eco was a tedious task rather beneath someone of my intellectual stature.  The physics of the game were astoundingly poor; who ever heard of a &quot;double jump&quot;?  Even on the moon, with its unique gravity, Neil Armstrong was unable to do a double jump, and so the suggestion that a spiky-haired cartoon character can transcend the laws of physics is both preposterous and offensive.Furthermore, it has been noted in countless reviews that Daxter, the sidekick, is not irritating, and even perhaps amusing.  Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong!  You plebians know nothing!  Daxter is the Newman of video games characters, the annoying sidekick that you hope will go away but never does.In conclusion, the game looks nice, plays nice, but is ultimately boring and undeserving of my attention.  Go play Dynasty Warriors or SSX Tricky instead!

How can you have a game where all the characters are Japanese, the setting is Japan, and yet have all the characters speak in U.K. English with U.K. accents? Talk about spoiling a great thing. Siren 2 is supposed to be on the horizon, and hopefully the game's makers will come to their senses and include the Japanese audio track for all releases. It could have been right up there with Silent Hill, but instead the realism, and thus the intensity and scary factor, is lessened because of the lack of a Japanese audio track, which could have been easily included since this game was released in Japan with such an audio track. Those responsible for releasing this in America must have made a major mental lapse -- I hope so, because if they actually sat down and thought of some "reasons" to not include the original language track, then there's simply no excuse, no justification. Ridiculous, just plain ridiculous.

Sure it was fun for the first hour then it died. I could never get the kids to stop vandalism. Riding the rollercoasters weren't fun at all. You want a theme park game get Rollercoaster tycoon. Rollercoaster tycoon not Rollercoaster tycoon 2, but I won't get into that. Where can I get a refund....?

I expected this game to really rule. I thought to myself, &quot;Tens of thousands of players rpging together? It will be chaos! People will be banding into nations and battling each other for dominion! Imagine my disappointment when I found that pking is not only disallowed(or restricted), in most servers, most players I talked to professed DISGUST at player killers! Worse, guards are now near invulnerable. What? Can't a guy have a little fun and slip a 6-inch dagger between a guard's plates and into his back? It's only an AI. I pray for the day that someone with a sense of fun (dreary drugdgery, which is what this game is starting to feel like after four months) takes over this company and point this world into the right direction.

&quot;EverQuest: Planes Of Power&quot; was obviously designed to cater to &quot;Uber-Guilds,&quot; an expression used in the EverQuest online community to denote player guilds which are rather advanced in skills and prior experience, and large in numbers. The single adventurer, as well as the casual gamer or relative newcomer, will find little to no content whatsoever which is available to them in this expansion pack (past a certain point). It is all about groups and large scale raids. Solo gameplay in the &quot;Planes of Power&quot; zones is next to impossible, and that is appparently by design. In fact, several player class abilities were &quot;nerfed&quot; by Sony just prior to the release of this expansion, ostensibly to &quot;better balance the classes.&quot; It is far more likely that those &quot;nerfs&quot; were enacted to prevent any possibility of traditional solo classes (such as Wizards and Druids) from being able to do any effective soloing in the new zones.Another problematic feature of this add-on is the overpowered &quot;gear&quot; that one can obtain from the high-end encounters featured in &quot;PoP.&quot; Introducing too much &quot;uber gear&quot; to an MMORPG game is precisely what ultimately ruined &quot;Diablo 2&quot; when the &quot;Lord of Destruction&quot; expansion was released. For many gamers, the focus becomes shifted away from roleplaying and game content, and instead toward greed for items which they can strut and show off to other players. It also tends to make player characters who *can* manage to obtain those items a bit too powerful, which hardly seems to fit in with Sony's highly questionable assertions... that several prior ability nerfs were done to &quot;better balance the classes.&quot; If anything is true about &quot;Planes of Power,&quot; it's that it is decidely UN-balanced in the extreme.Painfully short on game content, all too few and sloppily written quests, overly lengthy encounters and a generally poor payoff in the &quot;Plane of Time&quot; endzone are what one can expect from this mediocre expansion pack. Whilst it is a &quot;must have&quot; for all EverQuest players, it hardly stacks up well against prior expansions such as &quot;Scars Of Velious&quot; or &quot;Shadows Of Luclin&quot; so far as actual depth, atmosphere and overall content is concerned. This is also the first EverQuest expansion set which the original game designers (Verant International) had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with, and it shows. Moreover, &quot;Planes Of Power&quot; is an expansion pack which 99% of all players will never see the bulk of, due to their being unable to assemble the &quot;muscle&quot; required to fully explore the additional zones and adversaries. Not being able to see three quarters of a game you pay for is rather disappointing (to say the least), so unless you already belong to a highly-skilled player guild, do not expect to progress past a very superficial point in this add-on to EverQuest.Lastly, &quot;The Planes Of Power&quot; tends to look and play more like a Sony PlayStation 2 game than an add-on for a classic PC based MMORPG. Storyline depth and roleplaying content has been replaced in favour of eye candy, overpowered enemies, and ridiculously and unnecessarily overpowered items designed to appeal to player egos. &quot;PoP&quot; is not entirely without merit, but depending on what you look for in a roleplaying game, you may be disappointed overall. Defenders of this add-on have often said to me  &quot;Well, Sony knows what sells, that's why PoP is the way it is, and that's the bottom line.&quot; Naturally, I have no problem with manufacturers of PC games making a profit on their merchandise, but I see no reason why profits and product integrity need be mutually exclusive concepts.Thumbs down overall, but a necessary add-on for all EverQuest players.

For many gamers, the focus becomes shifted away from roleplaying and game content, and instead toward greed for items which they can strut and show off to other players. It also tends to make player characters who *can* manage to obtain those items a bit too powerful, which hardly seems to fit in with Sony's highly questionable assertions... that several prior ability nerfs were done to &quot;better balance the classes.&quot; If anything is true about &quot;Planes of Power,&quot; it's that it is decidely UN-balanced in the extreme.Painfully short on game content, all too few and sloppily written quests, overly lengthy encounters and a generally poor payoff in the &quot;Plane of Time&quot; endzone are what one can expect from this mediocre expansion pack. Whilst it is a &quot;must have&quot; for all EverQuest players, it hardly stacks up well against prior expansions such as &quot;Scars Of Velious&quot; or &quot;Shadows Of Luclin&quot; so far as actual depth, atmosphere and overall content is concerned. This is also the first EverQuest expansion set which the original game designers (Verant International) had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with, and it shows. Moreover, &quot;Planes Of Power&quot; is an expansion pack which 99% of all players will never see the bulk of, due to their being unable to assemble the &quot;muscle&quot; required to fully explore the additional zones and adversaries. Not being able to see three quarters of a game you pay for is rather disappointing (to say the least), so unless you already belong to a highly-skilled player guild, do not expect to progress past a very superficial point in this add-on to EverQuest.Lastly, &quot;The Planes Of Power&quot; tends to look and play more like a Sony PlayStation 2 game than an add-on for a classic PC based MMORPG. Storyline depth and roleplaying content has been replaced in favour of eye candy, overpowered enemies, and ridiculously and unnecessarily overpowered items designed to appeal to player egos. &quot;PoP&quot; is not entirely without merit, but depending on what you look for in a roleplaying game, you may be disappointed overall. Defenders of this add-on have often said to me  &quot;Well, Sony knows what sells, that's why PoP is the way it is, and that's the bottom line.&quot; Naturally, I have no problem with manufacturers of PC games making a profit on their merchandise, but I see no reason why profits and product integrity need be mutually exclusive concepts.Thumbs down overall, but a necessary add-on for all EverQuest players.
The general consensus amongst the MMORPG community would seem to be this: EverQuest II is yet another example of Sony's fanatical obsession with eye candy over content.There's little to no "meat" here... in fact, Sony's own online websites can't seem to provide any sort of storyline behind EverQuest II, other than it being set 400 years or so from the time of the original EverQuest, the moon of Luclin blew up, and now the entire huge, sprawling world of Norrath has been reduced to two measly starting cities, on one continent......sounds pretty cheesy to me. Wanna see another red flag..? The sheer size of the installation of this game positively SCREAMS that it's loaded with resource-sucking bells and whistles, which Sony is well-known for focusing on when their overall storyline and content are weak.Most veteran EverQuest players have watched Sony Online Entertainment completely RUIN the original EverQuest, ever since late 2002 when Sony bought out Verant (the originators of that once-classic MMORPG game). Given what we've all seen from SOE over the past few years (the destruction of EverQuest, the absurdly pointless Star Wars Galaxies, horrible customer service, and insultingly shameless greed), I see absoultely no reason whatsoever to believe that EverQuest II will be anything short of an overpriced, inane memory hog of a "game" that will ultimately leave the player feeling unsatisfied and cheated....

For adults, the James Perkins review of Black and White nails this game.  Read it, then skip purchasing this game.  I was very excited about getting it after reading/believing the hype.  The creature and its &quot;leashes&quot; drove me insane, and detracted from the small amount of entertainment I had begun having from solving the puzzles in the game.  Maneuvering is (IMHO) counter-intuitive, especially which way the POV revolves based on the sliding of the mouse.  And the forced tutorial is mind-numbing.  The only worse &quot;forced&quot; passage in a game is the part of NOLF where you have to ask the fat industrialist all of those inane questions.

At least the URBZ Sims have a life (cause I don't).  Very addictive game.  I think young girls would enjoy this game more than boys or adults.  What I enjoyed about the previous Sims' games was you could create which perked my interest in architecture.  You cannot create much in this game.  You mostly work to raise your reputation to complete goals.  Also the creators of URBZ should have given us gamers a better instructional booklet.  Had no idea how to use the Power Ups and wasn't sure what to do when I had to go to work.  What do you do if the robot station burns down?  The URBZ are not very happy in this part of town.  Be prepared to spend most of your time waiting for the game to load.  That's one of the reasons I do not have the patience to play the game through again.  You can't complete the last goal - it must be a secret.  Rumors are spreading that you have to play through the game 3 more times to fulfill the last goal.  Some games I enjoy the second & third times when I play through, but this is not one of those games.  If this is a taste of where the Sims' games are heading, I won't be playing with the Sims anymore - sorry Bella.

We received this today, and were shocked to find not even an Instruction Booklet included with the game.  Feeling disappointed.I originally posted the above sentence and was called every name in the book by morons because I wanted even a simple Instruction Booklet included.Now that being said, after a month of trying to play and enjoy this game, I am still disappointed.  We had hoped for more.The game controls are awkward and not conducive to enjoyment.  The story line is fragmented and makes it hard to become enamored enough with the plot that MAY encourage one to get beyond the cumbersome controls.This game sucks....and I regret ever ordering it.
i recived this in the mail it was the case and booklet but LEFT FOR DEAD UNO i was furious
So... just a disc in a paper sleeve?  That's it?  No booklet?  No box?  No bueno!  This cost me $20?  I could have just downloaded the full game for less.  Now I have to go looking for a box to put this game in and without any box art it will always look like I found it at a garage sale.  Avoid buying this here.

This game has Beautiful graphics but overall its just a terrible derivative story, long winded and contrite at times. The sequences through out the game are just repetitive and almost forced most of the time. Fragmented and lost in a sea of cliches and predictable storylines it tries to be something more than what it could have been....Very dissapointed as I loved Heavy Rain...

boring,  Traded it in after 1 hour.
simply cannot be read. returned
looks gorgous, boring shooter.
I, too, was excited about Spore until I heard about the DRM. That's a dealbreaker.
I don't get the love for this game.  "Lame" is what they should call it.
A Bad game that appears to be a great one..

I own every EA FIFA World Cup title since World Cup '98 and have looked forward to the EA Games quadrennial release ever since. I purchased 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil right in the middle of the actual World Cup and unfortunately so far I am severely disappointed with the product EA has released.--------------------GAMEPLAY & GRAPHICS:Before I get into that though, you should know a few more things about this game. If you've played FIFA 2014 then you'll likely be very familiar with 2014 World Cup. This game borrows all major gameplay elements directly from FIFA 2014. Personally I really enjoyed FIFA 2014 though based on many reviews I've read that titles reception was quite mixed.The major element of change for 2014 World Cup is of course the venue and the emphasis on national teams over club teams. EA has always done a good job with capturing the spirit of the world cup and the spectacle that surrounds each game. That remains intact in 2014 FIFA World Cup. Each game features a full introduction as you'd expect in a real World Cup game - including the players marching out onto the field, the playing of national anthems, etc. Big games (and the final) feature team and player celebrations, fireworks, confetti and all the celebratory aspects surrounding the biggest spectacle in sports. All is well in this regard of the game.Many reviews have commented on how much more difficult 2014 World Cup is than the standard FIFA 2014 game. I think that there is definitely a higher degree of difficulty but it's not too bad. I play both games on the "Professional" setting and I've been able to adapt quite well to 2014 World Cup's extra bit of difficulty. I've written off the spike in difficulty as just a matter of course - you are after all supposed to be playing at the highest level soccer has to offer.Graphics are a considerable improvement over the last World Cup game (2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa) and again are taken almost directly from FIFA 2014. That's not a bad thing at all as the graphics are actually quite nice. Player models move quite well and look very close to their real-world counterparts. The extra sheen of celebration and the bright colors of the Brazilian theme add a welcome addition to FIFA 2014's somewhat toned-down look.--------------------THE PROBLEMS:My main issue with this game are the myriad of problems that it shipped with and to this day haven't been addressed. EA has taken a lot of flak from gamers and to be honest it's easy to see why.The first problem I noticed shortly after starting my first World Cup (at the group stage). I was prompted by the game to make my 23-man roster and noticed some strange problems. The first issue is that some players aren't selectable. Meaning that you can't rotate them out of your team for another player in the reserves. This is apparently totally random as I've tried many different times with different teams using a different save file. That really won't matter though because even the players who you can rotate will ultimately be changed by the game after making your selections. For example after swapping in a few key players in my Spanish team I saved and moved onto my first match against the Netherlands and immediately noticed huge gaps in my team. No Iniesta, Villa, Silva (even though they were clearly listed in my 23-man roster) and in their place were players that I didn't call up. Again, I've tested and confirmed this exact issue with different teams using different save files.More problems are located with the online element. Connecting is the biggest hurdle as EAs servers seem to be frequently offline. When you do get on matches are pretty inconsistent. Some matches seem to go well while others are a lagging mess or worse simply disconnect.After buying the game I jumped on EA's forum to see if there was a fix or if I was doing anything wrong and stumbled onto a forum full of people having the exact same issues. These issues have been reported since the launch of the title and are still not fixed (going on 3 full months) with the end of the World Cup looming in a few days as writing this review.--------------------CONCLUSION:EA does it again! They ship a game to meet a deadline instead of shipping a quality product. The game is broken and major elements are totally unusable. This company deserves the hate it gets. Do yourself a favor and confirm that these issues are fixed prior to buying this game or skip it altogether. Not recommended!
The major problem I had with 2004 was that there were too many 5 star players in the recruiting process and the teams that performed well enough, inked most of the five star recruits.  The problem that created was that after about three or four seasons I began to notice the dominant teams that signed the bulk of those players were unbeatable.  By the end of your seventh or eighth year, there were anywhere from 12 to 15 undefeated teams at seasons end. I haven't played 2005 enough to be positive that this problem has been fixed, but from just the first two seasons, it definitely appears so. There are actually upsets in 2005. That's about the only improvement I can name about 2005.Another problem with 2004 was that all you had to do was draft a fast QB , roll out of the pocket, approach the line of scrimmage to draw in the linebackers and DB's and then heave it downfield to your single covered receiver for a 40 yard gain. I was left hoping that EA would fix the defensive AI to recognize and defend that. Did I ever get what I asked for!  Overall, 2004 worked offensively.  2005 is an entirely different story. My QB usually completes about 20 percent of his passes, and I can never rush for over 50 YPG.  Toggle the AI settings, someone suggested?  Even the worse teams will roll over my D and I still can't seem to complete a pass or run the ball, even with the defensive AI on the dumbest level.  Sometimes I can move the ball well but usually end up punting or turning the ball over in my red zone. On the highest setting, all my games end about 10-7, both teams under 100 yds total offense.  On all-american, I score all the points and accrue all the offense with Baylor while OU gets battered by my unforgiving "C+" Defense. When you come out of your huddle, the AI defense is ALWAYS in the right formation.  If you try to audible, the defense counters your audible before your guys even move!  So you throw a pass to a seemingly wide open receiver, here comes five supermans flying in to break up the play. You try to keep the ball on the ground, but the defensive linemen blow past your O line and are on you like stink on poop!  My favorite is when you're running a sweep or an off tackle and your FB is in front of you and you see a beautiful run developing.....only to have Willie, Mike, or Sam effortlessly run right past your FB and smack the daylights out of you ( Your FB doesn't even make an attempt to block). Or you have a great drive going and you penetrate the red zone, you get sacked 3 times and have to punt or you fumble the ball if you try to keep it on the ground.  Ridiculous!Defensively, there were problems that were a problem in 04 but are dominant in 05.  It doesn't matter what setting I am playing on.  I can hold OU or Texas under 100 total yards of offense with the Baylor (C+) defense, while their defense holds my offense to the same figure. In my first season, I Had the #117 ranked offense, and the best defense ever to grace the gridiron of Division 1-A Football.  I held a top twenty five team (don't remember who) to -63 rushing yards and 30 passing yards on all-american. That's just not fun to me.I have beef in other areas of the game too, but wouldn't be able to fit it here. Suprisingly, I think EA is on the right track with this one, but major gameplay problems are the hindrance.  I recently played NFL 2K5 from Visual Concepts.  A flawed game no doubt, but a good one nevertheless.  At the end of the game, all of the statistics and scores, everything, looked realistic.  If EA could incorporate some of that realism into this NCAA franchise, it would no doubt be the best football game ever made.

All defenders can outrun Messi and Ronaldo. Referee do not blow rough play. Two of my players against the goal keeper all the players behind i pass ball to my teammate and it's offside i guess they have invisible players. The game is very slow and you have to keep holding the ball and turning around to move. who ever changed the fifa 13 passing with this crap needs to be fired. Here is me using my goal keeper to pass ball to my teammate and he cant trap the ball.
It seems EA will never fix their obvious AI problems.  Yet each year they add more gimmicks without fixing one of the main problems in their football game.I haven't bought Madden since Madden 03, and I will not buy another Madden title until they fix the AI problems.  I am sick of having CPU's sub par running backs breaking 5 and 6 tackles on 3rd and 6 just so they can get a first down.  QBs breaking tackles from LBs who outweight them by 100 pounds.  How about the CPU always allowing your CB's to be out of position when the CPU passes the ball, and on top of that, they slow the CB down to give the receiver a better chance to catch the ball!  Sub par receivers making leaping one handed catches in tight coverage while getting hit.  Passes going through defenders' bodies, helmets, hands, legs, arms etc. to end up in the receiver's hands.  Balls changing direction in mid air just so the receiver can catch it.  The CPU intentionally making tacklers dive in the opposite direction you expect them to, turning a would be minimal 2 or 3 yard gain into a maddening 20 yard gain.  Your defenders all seem to be conntected by a string so if you go in and dive to make a sack and miss (and most of the time you will miss or the QB will miracously break the tackle), your defender who is guarding the intended receiver, will automatically dive too if you switch to him, resulting in a BS 50+ yard TD pass.  The CPU automatically moving your linemen across the line on 3rd and 10, to give the offense a free 5 yard and then the CPU gets exactly 5 yards on the next play.  CPU QB's getting off perfect passes while having a LB inches from taking him down.If your offense you have to deal with your all star 95+ rated receivers dropping wide open passes.  All star QBs throwing balls out of bounds. All star RB's fumbling at the worse possible time.  You lineman are moved across the line by the CPU and you get flagged for a false start.  Your linemen miss obvious blocks so big gains are rare in a close game. Your QB automatically tucks the ball and takes a sack if a defender is 10 feet away, while the CPU QB can get a perfect pass off while he's being sacked almost.  Psychic defense that almost always know what play your going to run.  Refs almost always get in the way of your receiver when you absolutely need to convert a 3rd down.And who can forget the infamous comeback AI?  No lead is safe.  Even if your up by 20+ points at the half, your better off running the clock out starting in the 3rd quarter because the AI will do any and everything to get the lead and screw you; that includes your offense fumbling the ball, receivers dropping wide open passes, refs constantly calling clipping and holding on you after you get a good punt return or big gain.  Refs calling you for face mask penalties or pass interference after you stop the CPU on third down so the CPU can get a free first down, bad calls in the final two minutes of the game so you can't challenge.On special teams I have seen where I was lined up for the game winning field goal and I see my play clock is about to run out, so I call a timeout with 2 seconds left on the clock. The screen signals that I called a timeout, but a few moments after I call a timeout, the ref throws a flag AFTER the timeout was called. and I get pushed back five yards. Talk about a LATE whistle. Another occasion the CPU punted to me, and the ball CLEARLY went out of bounds at the 35 yard line. It was way beyond the side line and in fact nearly to the end of the thick white line; however the ball bounced back in bounds and the CPU downed it at the 21 yard line. I was so shocked, that I saved the replay. No matter what this CPU does to screw me, they always do one better everytime I play the game.I have experienced these things and more in Madden.  More so on defense.  while these problems certainly don't happen in every game, it happens on average every other game.  Sometimes the CPU will cheat on every single down making it impossible to win. Most of the time however, I can usually still win in spite of the cheating, it is still very frustrating when the CPU can constantly pull 60, 70 and 80 YD TD passes out their a$$ just so the game will be close.  This ruins the experience of an otherwise fun game.  I still play 2003, because I want to at least get my money's worth and play all 30 seasons while drafting college players from NCAA 2003.  After that, I will never even think about purchasing or playing another Madden or NCAA title again.For me, gone are the days that I rush out and buy the current year's sports title.  It is usually the same game as the previous one.  However, if you absolutely want a football title this year, get ESPN, and while it has its problems too, it is certainly a much better deal being only 20 bucks versus 50 bucks for Madden.Since the folks at EA are shaking in the fear of a little competition from ESPN, they have decided to purchase the NFL liscense exclusively for themselves so no other companies can make NFL games.  Because of this I suppose I won't be buying any football titles for the next 5 years.  Even IF EA fixed their obvious game problems during these 5 years, I STILL wouldn't buy Madden or NCAA ever again.  I don't even know if I will buy another EA game period.  I am sorry I just can't support any company that buys their way out of competition.  So long EA!

Even if your up by 20+ points at the half, your better off running the clock out starting in the 3rd quarter because the AI will do any and everything to get the lead and screw you; that includes your offense fumbling the ball, receivers dropping wide open passes, refs constantly calling clipping and holding on you after you get a good punt return or big gain.  Refs calling you for face mask penalties or pass interference after you stop the CPU on third down so the CPU can get a free first down, bad calls in the final two minutes of the game so you can't challenge.On special teams I have seen where I was lined up for the game winning field goal and I see my play clock is about to run out, so I call a timeout with 2 seconds left on the clock. The screen signals that I called a timeout, but a few moments after I call a timeout, the ref throws a flag AFTER the timeout was called. and I get pushed back five yards. Talk about a LATE whistle. Another occasion the CPU punted to me, and the ball CLEARLY went out of bounds at the 35 yard line. It was way beyond the side line and in fact nearly to the end of the thick white line; however the ball bounced back in bounds and the CPU downed it at the 21 yard line. I was so shocked, that I saved the replay. No matter what this CPU does to screw me, they always do one better everytime I play the game.I have experienced these things and more in Madden.  More so on defense.  while these problems certainly don't happen in every game, it happens on average every other game.  Sometimes the CPU will cheat on every single down making it impossible to win. Most of the time however, I can usually still win in spite of the cheating, it is still very frustrating when the CPU can constantly pull 60, 70 and 80 YD TD passes out their a$$ just so the game will be close.  This ruins the experience of an otherwise fun game.  I still play 2003, because I want to at least get my money's worth and play all 30 seasons while drafting college players from NCAA 2003.  After that, I will never even think about purchasing or playing another Madden or NCAA title again.For me, gone are the days that I rush out and buy the current year's sports title.  It is usually the same game as the previous one.  However, if you absolutely want a football title this year, get ESPN, and while it has its problems too, it is certainly a much better deal being only 20 bucks versus 50 bucks for Madden.Since the folks at EA are shaking in the fear of a little competition from ESPN, they have decided to purchase the NFL liscense exclusively for themselves so no other companies can make NFL games.  Because of this I suppose I won't be buying any football titles for the next 5 years.  Even IF EA fixed their obvious game problems during these 5 years, I STILL wouldn't buy Madden or NCAA ever again.  I don't even know if I will buy another EA game period.  I am sorry I just can't support any company that buys their way out of competition.  So long EA!
I thought madden 2001 will have a lot of difference with madden 2000 just like what fifa did, but the game was not even better a single bit! The linesmen in the game still aren't 3d modeled but still are 2d modeled! The graphics may be a bit better but has made the game very slow! Then i thought about the new players in miami dolphins. At madden 2000, dan marino was concederd still playing in real life but was not! And i saw that in madden 2001, Dan marino is still concedered as a player at the dolphins. The whole setup was bad. Madden also put in european football teams which i think is gossip. If those teams they put were real, i'd bet that the players aren't real players at all!

MLB Triple Play 2002 was quite a disappointment from my standpoint. Basically, the graphics are very poor and the player's faces don't look anything like players. For example, Luis Gonzalez (the player one the cover) is missing his facial hair. It's not that different than Triple Play 2001, only updated rosters and added stadiums for teams who changed. When I compared the two games, the stadiums in Triple Play 2001 looked a lot better than the ones in the 2002 version.Triple Play 2002 also skimped on the pitches for individual players. They gave a fastball and a change-up to every pitcher (whether they really throw it or not) and added some other pitches that did not match pitching styles i.e. giving a curve ball to Armando Benitez instead of a splitter, etc.Another weak aspect of this game is the lack of game modes. They have all the same things as Triple Play 2001, exhibition, season, playoffs, and homerun derby. Yawn.I suggest you don't buy this baseball game. I perfer Major League Baseball High Heat 2002. The graphics are beautiful and the gameplay is so well developed that sometimes I think I'm in the stands watching the game! Also, the player's faces match the ones in real life (which is nice to know considering Triple Play 2002 didn't get anything right.) Buy Major League Baseball High Heat 2002, it's a 50 dollar payment very well spent. Check out this game at Amazon reviews to find out more about it. I guarntee, you will not regret getting this game over Triple Play 2002!
