Take control of NBA star Kobe Bryant, and recreate all his moves. All the moves including the out of this world slams were digitized from Kobe himself!! This game is a must have. Also, another cool thing about this game is the fact that it's PA Announcer is none other than the Lakers real-life PA Announcer!!

This game also has an arcade mode, which is 3 on 3 basketball! It also has a 3 point shootout! Take control of three point hotshots like Pat Garrity, Reggie Miller, and the 3 point king, Peja Stojakovic!!After you win a championship with the Lakers, you can take control of the other teams in the league, along with superstar players like Tracy McGrady, Kevin Garnett, Chris Webber, Gary Payton, and others!

I've been playing adventure games since the original Crowther & Woods ADV.COM for CP/M, then later Infocom's Zork series (and others, including Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy), and on and on until finally I got hooked on the Tomb Raider series on Macintosh.  In other words, I know whereof I speak when I say Wind Waker may be the best adventure-style game I've ever played.  In my humble opinion, the Legend of Zelda games rank as one of the great crown jewels of Japan, right up there with Nikons, Toyotas and Zen.  The game starts slowly, and builds and builds ... and builds ... and builds ... until, when the little guy finally defeats the Big Hands in the Tower of the Gods ... and you enter the strange, black and white eeriness in the Castle beneath the Sea ... and you realize you've only just BEGUN to play this game, when at THAT point you realize you've been spending so much time in front of your TV and your GameCube because THAT world is so immeasurably more fascinating than THIS world, it strikes you:  What Nintendo has done defines magic.  Shakespeare at his finest could do this for an evening; Nintendo does it for days, weeks, and even longer.  Ok, that's hyperventilating, so enuff said.  But still!  Unless you have a deficient attention span or a prehuman intolerance for puzzles and mystery, PLAY THIS GAME.  Allow me to add, parts of Wind Waker are not specifically aimed at kids.  The final showdown with the Big Poe was both hilarious and immensely satisfactory, philosophically speaking.  I found myself thinking of schizophrenia, Dante's Inferno and the Stapuft Marshmallow Man simultaneously.  Mostly droll, occasionally satirical, Wind Waker sometimes walks a fine and perceptive line between storytelling and proscenium-bending sarcasm.  Example:  Why does the Nintendo Gallery sculptor hate Link's pictograph of Lenzo and his lady friend?  Because Link (i.e, you, dear gamer) acquired it by stealth!

Paper Mario number 2 is nintendo's much needed RPG. The gamecube(or nintendo) hasen't had a good role player since the first 'slim n' trim' mario game, and this is flat out fantastic.The plot isen't to surprising, Princess Peach gets kidnapped agian for the upmost time, but at least not from Bowser, from an evil army of 'surfer-dude' sounding X-nauts. Bowser is a playable character in the game, but not really an important character. The plot is that ,besides Peach being kidnapped, Mario came to the Husler filled town of Roughsport, on Peach's will, to find seven crystal stars which open the Door, supposedly is filled with treasure(but is not). He travels from all the locations on his magical map which shows where the stars are. The X-nauts are hunting for them, as well as Bowser is, and you do incouter the 'nauts numerous times. In each place the stars are, their is a party member as well as a pathitic boss fight. During your diffrent chapters, you find many intresting things, as the mafia, wrestling arenas', and the moon, also the lottery & Luwigi who is on his own mission to find Princess Eclaire in a totally origonal adventure. You also get to use the diffrent functions of paper: boat, airplane, thin, and tube.Heres an extra, to obtian the mouse theif Ms. Mowz, look for an anonamus trouble at the trouble center. And last of all, at the end of the 100 trials pit is something very speacial, I won't say what, but here a hint, it's a very speacial badge.

Mickey's Speedway USA is a good game. Mickey's Speedway USA is hard as hell trying to win 1st Place. Even though, on some of the tracks, the curves is too sharp which it make the tracks more confusing. And I always keeping bumping into the walls and fall off the road into the waters for example like Hawaii and Oregon tracks. It take the skills and a lot of practice to get really good at the game. I think the best character to use is Dewey or Louie.

Mickeys Speedway USA on N64 is 10x better than Mario Kart 64. It has better gameplay and tracks which makes it more fun. Sure it is Mickey and it is geared toward youger audiences but when it came out I was 18 and still bought it because I make my gaming decisions on gameplay. I miss this game and if I get a N64 this is in my top 5 list.

Excelente juego. Es muy diferente a cualquier juego de v&iacute;deo. Obliga a pensar y a moverse, dos cosas que en los v&iacute;deo juegos son muy escasas. los gr&aacute;ficos son simples, pero no se necesita mas. la m&uacute;sica es muy adictiva y divertida. Claro esta que uno no aguanta jugar por horas este juego, pero si lo anima a jugar un poco todos los d&iacute;as para seguir avanzando y eso es muy bueno con los ni&ntilde;os que normalmente se quedan pegados a un juego por horas.
Este no es el juego tradicional de mover el control. Este es el juego de mover el cerebro y luego mover el control. Muy sencillo, muy divertido y permite jugar en familia. Tiene muchas opciones y es muy divertido. Mis hijos y yo lo jugamos juntos todo el tiempo y me gusta por que no me aburre y no los aburre a ellos.
Es el juego que m&aacute;s les gust&oacute; a mis hijos de verdad que es sencillo pero muy entretenido. Adem&aacute;s Mario & Luigi hacen la diversi&oacute;n instant&aacute;nea.

What happens when gaming guru, Shigeru  Miyamoto, is oppressed with the role as the integral man for masterminding the next Zelda and Metriod titles?  From the production of Pikmin, it seems as if he seizes a deep, consoling breath and rips open a bag full of relaxation.  Ah, finally all that dreadful anxiety and flagrant expectations from gaming fans everywhere wash away.  His sheer brilliance veers into a jaunty, animated dream world.  Conclusively, he creates a bizarre game where players are ferried  onto a planet where replicas of giant onions come alive and spawn multicolored, cutesy creatures called Pikmin.  Perhaps Miyamoto's latest game is a minor escape from the daunting task of transcending the GameCube into unreachable stratum?  Whatever the case, Pikmin is not what would we ordinarily expect as a first-class launch title, but it doesn't even fall short to deliver one addictive gem.The player assumes the responsibility of Captain Orima who looks like a freshly baked character from Cartoon Network.  With a big, round nose, a mini space outfit, and a fish bowl for a helmet, it's hard not to think about pummeling the daylights outta' the adorable twerp.  Orima's story is basically a cakewalk.  The captain opts to go on vacation through space, in the duration of his flight, he has a sensible meal of onions when a sudden meteor slams onto his rocket.  Surviving the plunge onto an alien planet, Orima's ship has disintegrated into fragments spread across the land.  He must now retrieve the primary ship parts with the aid of the affable and obedient Pikmin before his spacesuit loses function.Playing in Real Time, Pikmin, at the core, is a strategy game.  At the start, the player sets off with a single, trusty Pikmin and is required to feed a three-legged onion with pellets or butchered insects.  After a certain amount of nourishment, the onions plant seeds that'll eventually sprout as Pikmin.  The essential objective to the game is to manage the carrot-shaped Pikmin and lead them on an expedition throughout the planet to recover Captain Orima's missing ship parts.  There are three fundamental breeds of Pikmin, the red ones red are unscathed by fire, the blue ones wade over water, and the yellow ones cart one another and catapult themselves as organic grenades.  Micromanaging elements are also supplemented for good measure.  Bridges are to be constructed for faster mobilization, walls should be demolished for augmented exploration, and strategy preparation must be done to maintain  the life of the Pikmin.  Frequently, goliath-sized vermin like maggots intrude on the Pikmins` progression.  With a whistle command, Captain Orima can order his army to quit their current task, huddle together and unite for a defensive onset.  Also, the Pikmin may proceed in the offensive, attacking a monster when its simply dozing off.  The maximum number of Pikmin a player can shepherd is a grand total of 100 with absolutely no slowdown whatsoever.  Moreover, the game has a time limit.  Working as a clock, the l6 circles atop the screen move from left to right, and once the furthest one is filled, the day draws to a close.  At the end of each day, the Pikmin must rest overnight and an analysis of the player's personal army is evaluated.  Not particularly lengthy, the addicting game can be whizzed within a jiffy of hours.  Crammed with bonus and high score modes, the game retains a good, extended platter of replayability.  What Miyamoto has done is sculpt the GameCube's first true classic.The GameCube's controller, feeling a bit tweaky at first, succeeds to superbly make a first-rate control scheme.  Captain Orima can be directed individually or accompanied with personal escorts.  The analog stick guides Captain Orima, the A button yanks Pikmin from the soil, the B joins Pikmin together, the X is used to distinguish Pikmin groups into separate colors, and the Y button looms the game information and map.  Additionally, the game's camera can be modified in any direction the player fancies, whether it be overhead, side, or the front.The second Pikmin invades the television screen, the player will irrefutably remark on how the graphics are gorgeously crafted or converged with intoxicating vivacity.  From what I have gathered from the many opinions of other gamers, players will either breath in revulsion or approval.  Technology-wise, the rich world of Pikmin is matchless.  With the control of the camera, the player can zoom in and out, screening through the huge landscapes.  Even the tiniest of details will stimulate the players imagination, like the vast region of mountains and shrubbery.  If not enchanting, the game's surroundings adequately present an overall smooth, graphical touch.  From the lighting, various shadowing, and sheer multitude of animation on the creatures, Pikmin is what I imagine as a tingly trip to la-la land.  Ironically, I felt a bit queasy after a few hours on this colorful madness.  While marveling and vacuuming your life on Pikmin, the players will notice how well the music suits this type of genre.  Indolent, tranquil sounds engulf the environment and is deliberately welcomed.  There are the congenial tunes of a pristine day materializing, and the placid kind which hails approaching slumber.  When an antagonistic intruder stumbles upon the Pikmins' camp, the music is swapped into a more rapid, upbeat tempo.  The musical score  proves to be finely executed.  The eccentric yet delightful sounds from the Pikmin, the battle cries, and other noises add deeply to this already remarkable game.Pikmin's basic gist is to genuinely refresh audiences with  entertaining amusement along with hours of nonstop gameplay.  Throughout the game I found myself beaming at the antics of Captain Orima and how ridiculously hilarious the Pikmin behave.  Initially when a tremendous, next-generation home console is released, a monster of a game convoys along, and although,  Nintendo honcho, Shigeru Miyamoto should have unleashed godhood, a Zelda or Star Fox game, Pikmin does not disappoint and is well worth the ownership for the novel, bold GameCube.

With a big, round nose, a mini space outfit, and a fish bowl for a helmet, it's hard not to think about pummeling the daylights outta' the adorable twerp.  Orima's story is basically a cakewalk.  The captain opts to go on vacation through space, in the duration of his flight, he has a sensible meal of onions when a sudden meteor slams onto his rocket.  Surviving the plunge onto an alien planet, Orima's ship has disintegrated into fragments spread across the land.  He must now retrieve the primary ship parts with the aid of the affable and obedient Pikmin before his spacesuit loses function.Playing in Real Time, Pikmin, at the core, is a strategy game.  At the start, the player sets off with a single, trusty Pikmin and is required to feed a three-legged onion with pellets or butchered insects.  After a certain amount of nourishment, the onions plant seeds that'll eventually sprout as Pikmin.  The essential objective to the game is to manage the carrot-shaped Pikmin and lead them on an expedition throughout the planet to recover Captain Orima's missing ship parts.  There are three fundamental breeds of Pikmin, the red ones red are unscathed by fire, the blue ones wade over water, and the yellow ones cart one another and catapult themselves as organic grenades.  Micromanaging elements are also supplemented for good measure.  Bridges are to be constructed for faster mobilization, walls should be demolished for augmented exploration, and strategy preparation must be done to maintain  the life of the Pikmin.  Frequently, goliath-sized vermin like maggots intrude on the Pikmins` progression.  With a whistle command, Captain Orima can order his army to quit their current task, huddle together and unite for a defensive onset.  Also, the Pikmin may proceed in the offensive, attacking a monster when its simply dozing off.  The maximum number of Pikmin a player can shepherd is a grand total of 100 with absolutely no slowdown whatsoever.  Moreover, the game has a time limit.  Working as a clock, the l6 circles atop the screen move from left to right, and once the furthest one is filled, the day draws to a close.  At the end of each day, the Pikmin must rest overnight and an analysis of the player's personal army is evaluated.  Not particularly lengthy, the addicting game can be whizzed within a jiffy of hours.  Crammed with bonus and high score modes, the game retains a good, extended platter of replayability.  What Miyamoto has done is sculpt the GameCube's first true classic.The GameCube's controller, feeling a bit tweaky at first, succeeds to superbly make a first-rate control scheme.  Captain Orima can be directed individually or accompanied with personal escorts.  The analog stick guides Captain Orima, the A button yanks Pikmin from the soil, the B joins Pikmin together, the X is used to distinguish Pikmin groups into separate colors, and the Y button looms the game information and map.  Additionally, the game's camera can be modified in any direction the player fancies, whether it be overhead, side, or the front.The second Pikmin invades the television screen, the player will irrefutably remark on how the graphics are gorgeously crafted or converged with intoxicating vivacity.  From what I have gathered from the many opinions of other gamers, players will either breath in revulsion or approval.  Technology-wise, the rich world of Pikmin is matchless.  With the control of the camera, the player can zoom in and out, screening through the huge landscapes.  Even the tiniest of details will stimulate the players imagination, like the vast region of mountains and shrubbery.  If not enchanting, the game's surroundings adequately present an overall smooth, graphical touch.  From the lighting, various shadowing, and sheer multitude of animation on the creatures, Pikmin is what I imagine as a tingly trip to la-la land.  Ironically, I felt a bit queasy after a few hours on this colorful madness.  While marveling and vacuuming your life on Pikmin, the players will notice how well the music suits this type of genre.  Indolent, tranquil sounds engulf the environment and is deliberately welcomed.  There are the congenial tunes of a pristine day materializing, and the placid kind which hails approaching slumber.  When an antagonistic intruder stumbles upon the Pikmins' camp, the music is swapped into a more rapid, upbeat tempo.  The musical score  proves to be finely executed.  The eccentric yet delightful sounds from the Pikmin, the battle cries, and other noises add deeply to this already remarkable game.Pikmin's basic gist is to genuinely refresh audiences with  entertaining amusement along with hours of nonstop gameplay.  Throughout the game I found myself beaming at the antics of Captain Orima and how ridiculously hilarious the Pikmin behave.  Initially when a tremendous, next-generation home console is released, a monster of a game convoys along, and although,  Nintendo honcho, Shigeru Miyamoto should have unleashed godhood, a Zelda or Star Fox game, Pikmin does not disappoint and is well worth the ownership for the novel, bold GameCube.
No he dejado de jugar todos los dias! felicidades al vendedor, los controles son excelentes y me gusta mucho el color
Lleg&oacute; en excelentes condiciones y copleto con ambos CDS! Me encantan los juegos de ZeldaLa &uacute;nica cosa es que tienes q tener el control motion plus para jugar
An amazing acci&oacute;n adventure game; with beautiful videos telling you the story. Most of the game is like an old 2D world, you can chance to first person view almos any time and you must do sometimes.Un extraordinario juego que regresa mucho a las raices de Metroid, juegas en 2D y muchas veces puedes y otras debes cambiar a perspectiva de primera persona. Videos muy bien hechos que te cuentan la historia, acci&oacute;n y aventura en un gran juego.Lo recomiendo mucho si te gustan los juegos cl&aacute;sicos o de este tipo.
Pikmin was created from Zelda's daddy, Shigeru Miyameto. Pikmin is about a guy from Earth who accidently crash-landed on a very strange and unusual planet filled with alien creatures that view the guy nothing less than breakfast, lunch, brunch, dinner, dessert, or a midnight snack. But later on when you look around, you find the "Pikmin", little alien creatures that are attracted to anything that pulls them out from the ground. The Pikmin are as loyal as dogs and will do whatever you order them to do. For example, if you tell them to kill a huge mushroom monster, they'll do it without complaining even if killing it means to get eaten themselves. You must repair your spaceship because the atmosphore is toxic to your little character. The game is intruging and innoventive from the start. People may say it's too kiddy but the game is meant to be played by all generations. (...) So in conclusion, Pikmin proves that Shigeru Miyameto is a mastermind at making video games.

This memory card is pretty good.  Although, it's good, memory card x16 has 1019 blocks.  The Memory Card 16x is usually ony about $20 now so I would recommend getting a 16x.  For people who need a lot of memory, I've seen a 32x memory card but I'm not sure if GameCube can handle it so the memory may become corrput on the 32x.

Don't let the cute graphics foolyou. Animal Crossing is a very addictive game that never ends. At first glance, one might think this game is for kids only. I wasskeptical at first, but now I amtotally immersed in the game.You start off by giving your character a name and choose eithermale or female. You are on a trainheaded to your town, which you canname. Then you are hired by an animal who owns a shop whom you must work for to pay off the payment of your house and the gamejust picks up from there. I would have to say this game is like Harvest Moon, remember this game?Animal Crossing is a lot more fun to play if you include up to 4 friends. Having them visit your town, via a memory card and you can visit your town makes it moreinteresting to play. You even geta free memory card with the game.If you are looking for a new gameto play, I'd suggest you go out and buy Animal Crossing.

I think that  mario 64 was better, still this one is very good. Much, Much better than Lugis Mansion! The only part of the game that is very bad is the camera... terrible! But the rest is just fun. Buy it, rent it, anything... it is fun! I wont gve 5 star because the camera. Proximo q venha!!

I just couldn't wait to get this game and when I finally got it.  I instantly fell in love with it the concept is beautiful the gameplay is on point. I love the new power-ups like the Ice Flower, The Propeller Mushroom and The Mini Mushroom. This feels like a hybrid between Mario 3 and Mario 64.  Yeah it's typical rescue the Princess but with a new feature such as Co-op yes Co-op, no longer do you have to wait for whoever you're playing to lose a life you can get in on the action as team of up to four, helping and fighting for a common goal.  This will definitely go down as one the best Wii games and I would definitely recommend this game to any Wii owner.  My ratings are GAMEPLAY 5stars, STORYLINES 5stars, CO-OP 5stars, NEW FEATURES and POWER UPs 5stars NEW SUPER MARIO BROS. WII 5stars
I've only played this game for a few hours and already I'm in love with it.  I played Mario Galaxy and that was a  great game despite the fact that Yoshi wasn't in it, I thought they made a mistake at first but after playing MG I felt who need him.  Until I played Mario Galaxy 2 Yoshi is back and better than ever  with  new colors and  new abilities, depending on what he eats. Yoshi get bloated and  blows air so you can fly for a short period of time when eating a blimp berry, he turns orange and runs faster after eating a dash pepper, he turns a hot yellow and  brighten hidden paths after eating a glimmer bulb berry it's just so awesome how they made him.  Now for the star of this game Mario himself  he returns with most of his previous MG abilities with of course some new ones as well such as Rock Mario, yes rock his hat and overall turns to stone giving him the power to turn into a boulder and roll and jump around to destroy enemies.  Another new power is Cloud Mario, he clothes become puffy looking resembling fire Mario but now he can create clouds to ride on as well he can now walk other clouds he would fall through this power up is very limited as you will see.  So as you just read Mario has once again came back and is better than ever, with a new challenging yet fun to play game.  This is a must-have for any Wii owner.  Now for my critical review GRAPHICS 5stars looks great, GAMEPLAY 5stars very fun to play,  STORYLINE 5stars great tie-ins, NEW FEATURES 5stars yoshi's back and new abilities and SUPER MARIO GALAXY 2 5stars.
I can see why some people didn't like it. The controls were a bit iffy, but it was still a fun game in my opinion. Then again most classic Mario games are.

Conker, a cute little red squirrel, is having a bad fur day. It all began when he celebrated his 21st birthday at the bar, getting blind drunk.  When the game begins, he is hungover and must find a way to get over it.Meanwile, the Panther King has spilled his milk!  He calls the professor and finds out he needs a new leg for his table.  Conker is the right size to be a leg for the table, so the King would never spill his milk again! Hooray!This game is the funniest game since &quot;South Park&quot; !

No.  "Mario 64" is still the king of the Nintendo 64 crop, however this comes close enough to be second or third.  First anounched as "Twelve Tales: Conker 64," Conker was supposed to be about Conker trying to save his girlfriend Berri from an evil cake and/or acorn (???)!  You would romp through a "Banjo-Kazooi" world, with "Banjo-Kazooi" style gameplay, and final there were many resemblences to "Banjo-Kazooi!"  For instence you collected golden acorns to unlock new levels, which much resembled the idea of the gold puzzle pieces you collected in, you gussed it, "Banjo-Kazooi!"However game sites deemed it way too cute, so Rare went back to the drawing board and came up with "Conker's Bad Fur Day" one year later.  Now the once cute squirle Conker cusses, vomits, swims in peoples (...) and (...), and spoofs every movie he can think of (Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan, JAWS, Terminater 2, The Matrix, and Mission Impossable to name a few)!  While most of the game is vugar as heck (And is very well deserved of the M rating), it's also funny as heck!Another good thing about the game is the different approch in the gameplay department.  Instead of the normal gameplay found in most Rare games, Conker now has to do more puzzle solving, jumping, swimming, and even shooting to keep the mature gamers intrest!  You honestly are never sure how your going to play the game next!  One minute I was herding cheese around, the next I was trying to make cows (...) out as much, well (...), out of their bodies as I possably could!  Oh and then I was in a warfield being attacked by Tediez (Don't ask), and then being...Dracula!?!CBFD is by no means perfect.  For thing the main game is too short, while the muti-player modes are pretty boring!  Plus there's only so much I can take of a cussing squirle before I get sick of playing this thing!  As long as your over 17 I highly recomend this game...as a rental!  But if you find it for [price] or less, then I gusse you can't go wrong.

Nintendo's reaction towards Conker's Bad Fur Day is a bit ambiguous. Conker's Bad Fur Day made headlines among the gaming industry when advertisements for this game appeared in Playboy and Maxim. I mean, this is a Nintendo 64 game! However, Nintendo had completely denied the game's existence in anything where people 17 or younger could access. Is it really that much worse than, say, Shadow Man or South Park 64, both of which received ample coverage from Nintendo Power and yet both of which had foul language and violence up the wazoo? It is hard to say (especially considering that I have barely played Shadow Man or South Park 64). Still, everybody I know that hates this game hates it not for its gameplay, but just the fact that the mad scientists in Twycross turned Conker from a cuddly, high-pitched squirrel with bland textures to a gruff squirrel with a penchant for beer, breasts, and 'bacco. (Accusations have been made that Conker had become rather foul-mouthed himself, but with only two swear words I know of, Conker's language is much tamer than those around him.) Still, CBFD is a welcome respite from the Rare platforming formula of collection and cute characters (you've got some darned ugly things in Conker's Bad Fur Day)...and when only one word that would have been censored from NSider was spoken.Conker's Bad Fur Day is a linear adventure game, where the completion of tasks in one area allows you to progress further into an adventure. You know...kind of like Ocarina of Time! Except in CBFD, A is your jump button, and B is the context sensitive button. With Ocarina of Time, the purpose of the context sensitive A button changes depending on the context, B in CBFD usually access the frying pan. The context only changes in the presence of a B-button pad or when a light bulb appears. This does kind of make the game feel forced, as if Rare is saying, "Roar! This is what you have do at this time! There's nothing you can do to change it!" Still, the levels and the situations have enough variety where you do not feel bogged down. The single-player mode is pretty short, but it is fun, funny, and full of strange situations that feel more like different episodes instead of a coherent, linear plot. It is strange to go from fighting a boss battle against a mound of anthropomorphic feces to a prehistoric world. But alas, such is the situation poor Conker must go through. Gameplay is also as varied as the storyline. While most of the game is platforming, there are times when the game switches to a Jet-Force-Geminiesque 3rd person shooter or a twisted racing game. Independent of the single-player adventure is the game's multiplayer mode. The multiplayer mode is as fun and incoherent as the single-player mode. You can race on hoverboards, escape the wrath of the Tediz as unarmed civilians, or go at it in several types of free-for-all deathmatches. Some modes are stale, but others are delicious and can provide hours of entertainment.Even without the Expansion Pak, Conker's Bad Fur Day is one of the best games for the Nintendo 64 visually and aurally. By 2001, Rare had already established themselves as being very ambitious with graphics (so much as to cause severe slowdown, but that doesn't appear very often in CBFD), and Conker's Bad Fur Day is one of their best efforts. Everything has such wonderful textures, and even though some of the flowers and stuff are obviously sprites, they aren't as bad as in some other games. Rare has gone on to give Conker lip synching even more accurate than those found in Dreamcast's Shenmue, although everybody else move their lips in a way that resemble the animal characters in Mononoke Hime. Voice acting in Conker's Bad Fur Day tops Perfect Dark and Star Fox 64 to become the best on the Nintendo 64. This is perhaps aided by some of the best writing ever to appear in a N64 game. Virtually every line is quotable, especially the Great Mighty Poo song. Sound effects are truly awesome, but it definitely does not hold a candle to the game's music. Conker's Bad Fur Day has some of the best music of all time. The songs are amazingly catchy, and well-done. And when was the last time a piece of music had farts as part of the melody? If games were ranked on a technical scale, then Conker's Bad Fur Day would definitely be near the top.

Banjo Tooie is very similar to Donkey Kong 64, which is deffinetally not a bad thing, afterall DK 64 is  supposed to be similar to Banjo Kazooie. Now, 2 years after Banjo Kazooie, everyones favorite Bear, Bird,and Shaman are back. In the beggining of Banjo Tooie, players are treated to a nice cinema in which Grunty comes back only to kill one of our favorite (more or less) characters whose brother replaces him to help Banjo and Kazooie. After the death, Banjo, Kazooie, and Mumbo Jumbo , go after Grunty to defeat her once and for all. After the Cinema, Banjo starts off right where BK ended with all the moves and the Adventure begins!  And what an adventure you will have! Besides the Adventure, there are multiplayer games similar  to those in Pokemon Stadium except much more (my favorite one is Tower of Tragedy.). Banjo Tooie also has excellent sound, graphics and Replay. If  you loved Donkey Kong 64, Banjo Tooie will and should find a place in your Video game collection. After DK 64 this is the best N64 game. Another great game by Rare. Thanks Rare!

Arguable the single most important videogame in history, SUPER MARIO BROTHERS, along with the Nintendo Entertainment System (hereafter referred to as the NES) singlehandedly resurrected the video game industry after the historic crash of 1983-1984.  Rather than reviewing the game itself, which has been done many times, I think many people may find the history how of this revolutionary title came to the videogame industry's rescue very interesting; I know I do.  I draw much of this information from various websites, one very good one in particular; unfortunately, I can't really plug them due to Amazon's policies.  Email me if you want the websites.By 1983, the gaming industry, in existence for a mere twelve years, had risen to an astonishing 3.2 billion dollar industry.  Atari spearheaded the industry, which introduced its first console in 1977 (Atari Video Computer System), and since had grown to hold two thirds of the entire market.  However, in 1984 all this would end with a thunderous crash.  This concise overview will show you the history of the home consol crash and how SUPER MARIO BROTHERS came to the rescue.In 1976, Warner Communications bought Atari for $28 million from the company's founder, Nolan Bushnell.  Over the next two years, Atari, suffering major production problems and Bushnell's bizarre management, lost Warner millions.  Bushnell and Warner's CEO fought, and in 1978 Bushnell was forced to leave.  Warner totally revamped the working style, and in 1979-1980, produced twelve new titles.  However, Atari was still dragging down Warner's stock.  Struggling to gain the market share, Atari made the smartest move they possible could have; in 1980, they began licensing arcade games, the first being SPACE INVADERS.  Over the next two years, Atari overtook the market, bringing in over half of Warner's overall profits.However, very significant problems would totally destroy the infant industry.  In 1981, Atari released PAC MAN on the VCS, and, because it was such a huge arcade hit, quickly became a bestseller.  Unfortunately, the quality was very low.  This was a major blow to the company's image, with fans and critics alike extremely disappointed.Another major stumble was one of video games' most infamous games, ET.  Warner bought the rights from Spielberg for twenty one million dollars. Atari, expecting the game to be as big a hit as the movie, which was the highest grossing film at that point, purportedly made more ET cartridges than there were consoles themselves.  ET proved to be a huge flop, nearly breaking Atari.By 1983, Atari was in serious trouble.  Suing Activision (which was disgruntled Atari employees who broke off and formed their own company) and Imagic, the two leading third party developers, Atari tried to gain control over its software catalogue.  Atari lost the suits.  Third party developers began popping up overnight, and the industry becomes saturated with very low-quality products.  (One of the most controversial is CUSTER'S REVENGE by Mystique, where the goal is to rape a Native American woman while avoiding being shot by arrows.)  The third-party developers went bankrupt; these cartridges were heavily discounted, and the major companies couldn't compete.  Another factor is the home computer market, that was just starting to come alive in 1984.  With an increasing amount of computer games and low prices, people started buying these over the consoles.All these factors lead to the crash of 1984.  In 1983 alone, Atari lost $356 million ($2 million daily).  Warner sold Atari to Jack Tramiel, former head of Commodore.  The video game industry died, with no major American corporation coming anywhere near it.  Enter Nintendo.A little history here will be highly illuminating as well.  What many people don't realise is Nintendo is a very old company, founded in 1889 (yes, you read that right) as a playing card company.  It became Japan's largest playing card company, and was very successful. In the 1960s, they moved away from the cards and got into the game and toy markets.  (A very interesting sidenote: during that same decade, Nintendo's president opened up a `special hotel' rented `by the hour.'  Supposedly, the married president was one of the hotel's top customers).  In the 1970s and early 1980s, the company scored significant points with big arcade hits and the Game and Watch product line.  In 1983, Nintendo released the Famicom (Family Computer).  It was a massive hit in Japan.  In 1983, Nintendo went to Atari because they wanted to release the Famicon to the American market.  Do to complications I won't go into, the deal fail through.  In 1984 they were looking to broaden their market share.1985, Nintendo announced the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System.  They release SUPER MARIO BROTHERS in Japan, scoring a huge hit.  In 1986, the NES comes full throttle into the American market, quickly becoming the biggest selling console ever, largely because of this title.  The NES owes much of its success to SUPER MARIO BROTHERS.  Coming prepacked with the console, there are an estimated 40 million copies of SMB in existence, making it the highest selling video game ever.Unparalleled, SMB blew open the doors to the videogaming world.  With rich palettes of colour, eight four level worlds, spot-on play control, and expert level design, SMB was a much longer game than most of Atari's products and was a game unlike any other at that time.  SMB also had the benefit of being very simple to grasp; run, jump, and fire.  It was also the first side-sroller as we know it, though Atari's PITFALL set up the concept.  Also, it's one of the best.  Without SMB, NES wouldn't have been nearly as big a hit.In the end, Nintendo came at the industry's key moment.  With a powerful new console and a very well-designed game, Nintendo resurrected video gaming.  With its phenomenal success of the NES and this game, the video game industry once again took off, becoming one of the world's most significant economical contributors.And we very largely have this game to thank for it.

I will always remember when I first learned that we got a SNES.  It was the summer of 1992.  Growing up in rural Oklahoma, my parents had a cow tank that we used for a swimming pool that we chlorinated.  I was in that tank all the time.  My father and my brother had gone to Oklahoma City (about an hour away from where we lived), and they had gotten an SNES, with "Super Mario World" prepackaged.  I immediately dried off, ran upstairs and my brother and I were immersed in Mario bliss.Being the Nintendo fans that we were, we were subscribers to Nintendo Power.  I poured over all the pre-cover of their latest [Nintendo] console, as well as any information we could glean of "Super Mario World".  I had even known some people who won the SNES in one of those give-aways they used to do back in the 1980s and 1990s on cereal boxes.  I was so jealous.Playing "Super Mario World" was a pure revelation that first time, and a perfect exhibition of the power of the SNES.  The graphics were gorgeous, the enemies were monstrous yet whimsical, and the Bullet Bills were enormous.There has always been a debate on which is better - "Super Mario Bros. 3" or "Super Mario World"..  For myself, I'd give the edge to "Super Mario World".  To be fair to "Super Mario Bros. 3", "Super Mario World" simply took the foundation laid by "SMB3" and perfected it, just like "The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past" did with the original "Legend of Zelda".Essentially, take everything great from "Super Mario Bros." and "Super Mario Bros. 3", expand the graphics and audio from 8-Bit to 16-Bit, overhaul the level lengths and add a ridable dinosaur named Yoshi, include a lot of secrets, and wa-la!, "Super Mario World"!Everything "Super Mario Bros. 3" is so adored for, "Super Mario World" takes and does several steps better, with only one exception - suits.  "Super Mario Bros. 3" famously introduced us to Racoon Mario, Hammer Mario, Frog Mario, and Tanooki Mario (though oddly no Boomerang Mario, which we wouldn't see until "Super Mario 3D Land").  "Super Mario World" only features Fire Mario and Cape Mario.  However, Cape Mario is able to fly for unlimited amounts of time, unlike Racoon Mario which is captive to a P-Meter and can only fly for short bursts.The story, always the same in the core Mario series, is simply that, while Mario, Luigi, and the Princess are on vacation to Dinasaur Land after the events of "SMB3", Bowser and his seven children kidnap seven dinasaur eggs and also abduct Princess Peach.  It is up to Mario to free the Princess and rescue the dinasaurs.  Don't worry though, the story's not important.  Mario is never about the story, it's always about the gameplay.  And what gameplay it is!"Super Mario World" is famous for introducing the world to Yoshi, the ridable dragon.  Miyamoto wanted Mario to ride a dinosaur in the original 1985 "Super Mario Bros.", but was not able to implement this new character until this game.  It is strange Yoshi doesn't appear in "Super Mario Bros. 3"; after all, ridable steeds appeared in "Adventure Island II" and also the later game "Little Nemo: Dream Master". [Regardless, you are given four types of Yoshis - the basic green one, the blue one [(who, when swallowing any type of turtle shell]]Regardless, you are given four types of Yoshi, each with a special power according to their colour: green, red, blue, and yellow.  The green is the most common.  Upon injesting a turtle shell, the red blows fire, the blue flies, and the yellow creates a dust storm attack.  The green is able to do all of these, if he swallows the same color turtle shell (red = fire, blue = flying, yellow = dust).  The special color yoshis are only available in secrect Star levels, where they appear as babies which Mario must feed five enemies for them to become full grown.Yoshi is also famous for eating.  Strangely enough, Mario must punch Yoshi in the back of the head before Yoshi sticks out his tongue, looking for goodies.One of my favorite additions is just how Miyamota and company added to the lenght.  One legitimate weakness of "SMB3" is simply how short so many of the levels are - many times, you complete the level just when you feel you are about halfway done.  Even Miyamoto commented on this on one of the reissues of "Super Mario Bros. 3", asking his developers if the game's original levels were really that short.  Once a level is beaten, you cannot go back.  No so with "Super Mario World". Indeed, due to the secret exits and alternate paths, Nintendo encourages you to go back and explore levels already beaten, and the levels themselves are consistently much longer than those found in "SMB3".Taking the overworld map first introduced in "SMB3", for the first (and, until the 2012 "New Super Mario Bros. U", only) time on a home console Mario game, the map is connected and completely visible, unlike its predecessor.  Previously, the worlds were divided into individual maps, but not "Super Mario World".  From the get go, you could view the entire game map.  Dinasaur Land comprises seven different areas, played in this order: Yoshi's Island, guarded by Iggy Koopa; Donut Plains, guarded by Morton Koopa Jr., Vanilla Dome, guarded by Lemmy Koopa, Twin Bridges, guarded by Luwig von Koopa; the Forest of Illusion, guarded by Roy Koopa; Chocolate Island, guarded by Wendy O. Koopa; and the Valley of Bowser, home to not only Bowser but Larry Koopa as well.You cannot underestimate how the world map truly effected gameplay.  For the first time on a significant level, you could choose your own path.  The map also afforded the game developers the opportunity to made the game chock-full of secrets, alternate paths, and hidden areas.  The secrets were not so esoterically hidden to be inaccessible to the average player either - if a regular level had a secret exit, the level would be a red dot; if no secret exit existed, then the level is represented as a yellow dot.Each world is thematically diverse.  The first world features basic levels that ease the player into the gameplay, teaching you the rules and dynamics of Mario's new adventure.  The second world is set in the plains, the third world is set in caverns, and the fourth world is set on dual bridges, along with some mountain levels.By the fifth world, the Forest of Illusion, the challenge has been ramped up, and to proceed you MUST find those deviously hidden secret exits.  We then have the "tasty (but dangerous!)" Chocolate Island, which also features a level that how fast you beat individual sections determines what the next segment of that level will be.  Then we have the challenging Ghost Ship (which, according to the instruction manual, is a wrecked ship from "Super Mario Bros. 3"), and the only boss level that Yoshi will enter. After that, naturally, is the Valley of Bowser.One of the best features are the two secret worlds - the Star World and the Secret World.  Unlike other Mario games, there are no warp zones present in "Super Mario World". However, there are levels called the Star Road, which enable you to get to different parts of the map quickly and effectively by accessing the Star World and completing the levels.  To connect the Star Road, you must find the secret exits.  Once you find the fifth and final level on the Star Road, you are then taken to the Secret World, a world of eight gruelling, ultra-challenging levels that will truly test your Mario metal."Super Mario Bros. 4: Super Mario World" (the official Japanese title) is the best 2D Mario out there, though perhaps "New Super Mario Bros. U" will usurp this game from its lofty throne.Interestingly enough, Miyamoto has said that he was not entirely happy with "Super Mario World", as he felt the game had been rushed to publication and not completed to his exacting standards.  However, just like "Mega Man 3" (a game also apparently rushed), "Super Mario World" is as good as it gets.  I wonder what further changes Miyamoto would have made.  Unfortunately we'll never know.Those who love masterpieces of excellent 2D platforming action would be amiss without this purchase for their SNES - and better yet, "Super Mario World" is also available on the Wii and Wii U's Virtual Console.  Pick this one up!  You won't regret it...-----[This was written separate from the review back in May 2012 about the Mario games' development history.  Notably, Miyamoto said that "Super Mario World" began development with a team of sixteen people, and took about three years to make.  As "Super Mario World" came out in November 1990, that means Nintendo began production on this game sometime in 1987 - the same year they were working on "Super Mario Bros. 3".  On a game forum someone asked why Nintendo did not release "Super Mario Bros. 3" on the SNES, instead of the NES, and was complaining they should have released the game on the more powerful system.  This was my answer:]Let's look at some Mario history, shall we?  SMB3 came out in Japan in October 1988. That means it was completed, finished, and ready to be published by that point in time.If you look at the Japanese publication dates, SMB came out in 1985, Lost Levels came out in 1986, Doki Doki Panic came out in 1987, and SMB3 came out in late 1988. Given the fact the game was finished and released by 1988 I would hardly call that "late in the NES hardware cycle". Actually, the NES had only been out three years when SMB3 hit Japan, although the Famicom came out in late 1983. However all the heavy hitters for the Famicom came out in 1985 and beyond.Essentially all Nintendo had to do at this point was release it on cart; the code was written and completed. If have a sequel to the biggest game for your console, and the sequel SMB2 is also a massive hit - why wouldn't they release SMB3 which was already completed and published in Japan? They had a massive financial interest in getting this game out.There are very few differences between the Japanese SMB3 and the western SMB3 (namely if Mario gets hit with a powerup he goes to little Mario rather than Super Mario, ala Mario with a mushroom). There's nothing like the major differences between the Japanese and the Western versions of Zelda II The Adventure of Link.All four 8-bit NES titles were completed in a three year period, 1985-1988 (and were published in Japan as well, though SMB2, there called SMB USA, came out in 1992).I've read SMB3 took about two to three years to program, meaning Nintendo began work on it possibly by late 1985 (though that does sound entirely too early) but definitely by early 1987 and possibly even late 1986 given it was released in October 1988 and both Doki Doki and Lost Levels would have been finished (in the case of Doki Doki, it would have been closed to being completed if not already completed).In comparison today, that would be like saying Nintendo should not have released "New Super Mario Bros. Wii" back in 2009 (three years into the Wii lifecycle) because obviously the Wii U is coming up and they should save it for a new system. The timeframe is the same. And according to your logic, for this generation we definitely SHOULD NOT have gotten Skyward Sword for the Wii, despite the fact it has had a five year development timeframe was began shortly after Twilight Princess came out..I do find it strange that they had problems with Yoshi (which for the record Miyamoto has said he wanted to put in the original 1985 SMB). After all, Hudson's Adventure Island series, the same company responsible for the abomination that is Super Mario Bros. Special, the first ever sequel to the Mario franchise, were able to get ridable dinasaurs, and the 1993 Capcom title Little Nemo Dream Master had ridable creatures too.Then again, Adventure Island II came out in April 1991, two and a half years after SMB3.Basically, I said all that to say you should research your Mario history more. When Nintendo began development on SMB3 (late 1986/early 1987) the Super NES was nowhere on the horizon, at least not publically. Even in late 1988 when the game was published, we were still over two years away from the Super Famicom which came out in Japan in November of 1990.So that's why they didn't develop it for the Super Famicom.
I will always remember when I first learned that we got a SNES.  It was the summer of 1992.  Growing up in rural Oklahoma, my parents had a cow tank that we used for a swimming pool that we chlorinated.  I was in that tank all the time.  My father and my brother had gone to Oklahoma City (about an hour away from where we lived), and they had gotten an SNES, with "Super Mario World" prepackaged.  I immediately dried off, ran upstairs and my brother and I were immersed in Mario bliss.Being the Nintendo fans that we were, we were subscribers to Nintendo Power.  I poured over all the pre-cover of their latest [Nintendo] console, as well as any information we could glean of "Super Mario World".  I had even known some people who won the SNES in one of those give-aways they used to do back in the 1980s and 1990s on cereal boxes.  I was so jealous.Playing "Super Mario World" was a pure revelation that first time, and a perfect exhibition of the power of the SNES.  The graphics were gorgeous, the enemies were monstrous yet whimsical, and the Bullet Bills were enormous.There has always been a debate on which is better - "Super Mario Bros. 3" or "Super Mario World"..  For myself, I'd give the edge to "Super Mario World".  To be fair to "Super Mario Bros. 3", "Super Mario World" simply took the foundation laid by "SMB3" and perfected it, just like "The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past" did with the original "Legend of Zelda".Essentially, take everything great from "Super Mario Bros." and "Super Mario Bros. 3", expand the graphics and audio from 8-Bit to 16-Bit, overhaul the level lengths and add a ridable dinosaur named Yoshi, include a lot of secrets, and wa-la!, "Super Mario World"!Everything "Super Mario Bros. 3" is so adored for, "Super Mario World" takes and does several steps better, with only one exception - suits.  "Super Mario Bros. 3" famously introduced us to Racoon Mario, Hammer Mario, Frog Mario, and Tanooki Mario (though oddly no Boomerang Mario, which we wouldn't see until "Super Mario 3D Land").  "Super Mario World" only features Fire Mario and Cape Mario.  However, Cape Mario is able to fly for unlimited amounts of time, unlike Racoon Mario which is captive to a P-Meter and can only fly for short bursts.The story, always the same in the core Mario series, is simply that, while Mario, Luigi, and the Princess are on vacation to Dinasaur Land after the events of "SMB3", Bowser and his seven children kidnap seven dinasaur eggs and also abduct Princess Peach.  It is up to Mario to free the Princess and rescue the dinasaurs.  Don't worry though, the story's not important.  Mario is never about the story, it's always about the gameplay.  And what gameplay it is!"Super Mario World" is famous for introducing the world to Yoshi, the ridable dragon.  Miyamoto wanted Mario to ride a dinosaur in the original 1985 "Super Mario Bros.", but was not able to implement this new character until this game.  It is strange Yoshi doesn't appear in "Super Mario Bros. 3"; after all, ridable steeds appeared in "Adventure Island II" and also the later game "Little Nemo: Dream Master". [Regardless, you are given four types of Yoshis - the basic green one, the blue one [(who, when swallowing any type of turtle shell]]Regardless, you are given four types of Yoshi, each with a special power according to their colour: green, red, blue, and yellow.  The green is the most common.  Upon injesting a turtle shell, the red blows fire, the blue flies, and the yellow creates a dust storm attack.  The green is able to do all of these, if he swallows the same color turtle shell (red = fire, blue = flying, yellow = dust).  The special color yoshis are only available in secrect Star levels, where they appear as babies which Mario must feed five enemies for them to become full grown.Yoshi is also famous for eating.  Strangely enough, Mario must punch Yoshi in the back of the head before Yoshi sticks out his tongue, looking for goodies.One of my favorite additions is just how Miyamota and company added to the lenght.  One legitimate weakness of "SMB3" is simply how short so many of the levels are - many times, you complete the level just when you feel you are about halfway done.  Even Miyamoto commented on this on one of the reissues of "Super Mario Bros. 3", asking his developers if the game's original levels were really that short.  Once a level is beaten, you cannot go back.  No so with "Super Mario World". Indeed, due to the secret exits and alternate paths, Nintendo encourages you to go back and explore levels already beaten, and the levels themselves are consistently much longer than those found in "SMB3".Taking the overworld map first introduced in "SMB3", for the first (and, until the 2012 "New Super Mario Bros. U", only) time on a home console Mario game, the map is connected and completely visible, unlike its predecessor.  Previously, the worlds were divided into individual maps, but not "Super Mario World".  From the get go, you could view the entire game map.  Dinasaur Land comprises seven different areas, played in this order: Yoshi's Island, guarded by Iggy Koopa; Donut Plains, guarded by Morton Koopa Jr., Vanilla Dome, guarded by Lemmy Koopa, Twin Bridges, guarded by Luwig von Koopa; the Forest of Illusion, guarded by Roy Koopa; Chocolate Island, guarded by Wendy O. Koopa; and the Valley of Bowser, home to not only Bowser but Larry Koopa as well.You cannot underestimate how the world map truly effected gameplay.  For the first time on a significant level, you could choose your own path.  The map also afforded the game developers the opportunity to made the game chock-full of secrets, alternate paths, and hidden areas.  The secrets were not so esoterically hidden to be inaccessible to the average player either - if a regular level had a secret exit, the level would be a red dot; if no secret exit existed, then the level is represented as a yellow dot.Each world is thematically diverse.  The first world features basic levels that ease the player into the gameplay, teaching you the rules and dynamics of Mario's new adventure.  The second world is set in the plains, the third world is set in caverns, and the fourth world is set on dual bridges, along with some mountain levels.By the fifth world, the Forest of Illusion, the challenge has been ramped up, and to proceed you MUST find those deviously hidden secret exits.  We then have the "tasty (but dangerous!)" Chocolate Island, which also features a level that how fast you beat individual sections determines what the next segment of that level will be.  Then we have the challenging Ghost Ship (which, according to the instruction manual, is a wrecked ship from "Super Mario Bros. 3"), and the only boss level that Yoshi will enter. After that, naturally, is the Valley of Bowser.One of the best features are the two secret worlds - the Star World and the Secret World.  Unlike other Mario games, there are no warp zones present in "Super Mario World". However, there are levels called the Star Road, which enable you to get to different parts of the map quickly and effectively by accessing the Star World and completing the levels.  To connect the Star Road, you must find the secret exits.  Once you find the fifth and final level on the Star Road, you are then taken to the Secret World, a world of eight gruelling, ultra-challenging levels that will truly test your Mario metal."Super Mario Bros. 4: Super Mario World" (the official Japanese title) is the best 2D Mario out there, though perhaps "New Super Mario Bros. U" will usurp this game from its lofty throne.Interestingly enough, Miyamoto has said that he was not entirely happy with "Super Mario World", as he felt the game had been rushed to publication and not completed to his exacting standards.  However, just like "Mega Man 3" (a game also apparently rushed), "Super Mario World" is as good as it gets.  I wonder what further changes Miyamoto would have made.  Unfortunately we'll never know.Those who love masterpieces of excellent 2D platforming action would be amiss without this purchase for their SNES - and better yet, "Super Mario World" is also available on the Wii and Wii U's Virtual Console.  Pick this one up!  You won't regret it...-----[This was written separate from the review back in May 2012 about the Mario games' development history.  Notably, Miyamoto said that "Super Mario World" began development with a team of sixteen people, and took about three years to make.  As "Super Mario World" came out in November 1990, that means Nintendo began production on this game sometime in 1987 - the same year they were working on "Super Mario Bros. 3".  On a game forum someone asked why Nintendo did not release "Super Mario Bros. 3" on the SNES, instead of the NES, and was complaining they should have released the game on the more powerful system.  This was my answer:]Let's look at some Mario history, shall we?  SMB3 came out in Japan in October 1988. That means it was completed, finished, and ready to be published by that point in time.If you look at the Japanese publication dates, SMB came out in 1985, Lost Levels came out in 1986, Doki Doki Panic came out in 1987, and SMB3 came out in late 1988. Given the fact the game was finished and released by 1988 I would hardly call that "late in the NES hardware cycle". Actually, the NES had only been out three years when SMB3 hit Japan, although the Famicom came out in late 1983. However all the heavy hitters for the Famicom came out in 1985 and beyond.Essentially all Nintendo had to do at this point was release it on cart; the code was written and completed. If have a sequel to the biggest game for your console, and the sequel SMB2 is also a massive hit - why wouldn't they release SMB3 which was already completed and published in Japan? They had a massive financial interest in getting this game out.There are very few differences between the Japanese SMB3 and the western SMB3 (namely if Mario gets hit with a powerup he goes to little Mario rather than Super Mario, ala Mario with a mushroom).

Before I go any further, there is one reason why you need to play "Yoshi's Island".  During one of the boss battles, Mario and Yoshi are fighting a giant frog's Uvala while trapped in the frog's stomach (it's a weird battle, to say the least); after defeating the frog, the frog then literally expels Yoshi and Mario out through its rectum.  Without a doubt this is the strangest scene in the entire Mario series, even with the "Peach is Bowser Jr's mother" scene in "Super Mario Sunshine.If you go in expecting a conventional Mario title, you will be disappointed.  "Yoshi's Island" makes "Super Mario Bros. 2" look like a straight up, traditional Mario title in comparison, it's that different.Over the years, I've played every Mario game in the main series either at or near launch, from the 1985 "Super Mario Bros." to the 2012 "New Super Mario Bros. 2" and all the games in between, missing only two: the 1989 "Super Mario Land", the most insubstantial Mario game in existence, and the 2002 "Super Mario Sunshine" [from 2002] for the Gamecube.My personal history with "Yoshi's Island" is I first played the first few levels at a lake house with my scuba instructor's grandson in 1999.  In 2002, I bought an SNES cart second hand on eBay and again played it briefly.  At that point in my life, I had bought "Super Mario All-stars" and "Yoshi's Island" to play with my college friends, and several of them hated the visual style of "Yoshi's Island" so we really didn't play it very frequently.  Fast forward to 2012, and I began playing through "Yoshi's Island" in earnest.But wait, you may say.  What about "Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island"?  Although the title may confuse things, "Super Mario World 2" is no more a Mario game than "Super Mario Land 3: Wario Land".  Both use pre-existing Mario brands to jumpstart sales, and neither one star Mario. Both games launched their own perspective sub-series in the Mario universe, completely separate from the main series.  And both are jaw-dropping titles.Perhaps the most revealing evidence that "Yoshi's Island" is not a Mario game is its original Japanese title: "Super Mario: Yoshi's Island".  Only when Nintendo brought the game to the States did the title "Super Mario World 2" become associated with this release.  Most revealing, however, is the 2002 Gameboy Advance port in the "Super Mario Advance" series, where Nintendo reverted back to its original Japanese title of "Super Mario: Yoshi's Island".  Likewise, although called "Super Mario World 2", this game is not a sequel to the original Mario world in the conventional series, but appears first chronologicay.  Nintendo released the loose sequel, the 1998 "Yoshi's Island" for the N64, and the 2006 "Yoshi's Island DS" for the DS.All that being said, what does this dispute between "Is it a Mario game or not?" the game, besides my own personal justification for not playing the game for so many years?  What does this distinction have to do with the actual gameplay itself?  Well, quite a lot actually.  Just like "Super Mario Land 3: Wario Land" where you play as Wario, you do not control Mario.  Instead, (with only very brief exceptions) you control Yoshi. Exclusively.Another big change?  The art style.  Due to the game taking place while Mario is a baby, the art style reflects a story-book, hand drawn visual appearance and also features what can only be considered crayon coloured backgrounds and sprites.  By 1995, Nintendo had mastered the graphically prowess of the SNES, and with the advent of the "Super FX 2" chip, they accomplished visual feats which you would think was far beyond the power of the SNES.  That same year, Nintendo released "Donkey Kong Country", another amazing title visually.  "Yoshi's Island" features sprite scaling and rotation (advertised as "Morphmation" technology), basic polygonal rendering for limited 3D effects, and advanced parallax scrolling.While daring, this visual style gives "Yoshi's Island" the appearance of being marketed for small children.  While Mario has always been whimsical and colourful, "Yoshi's Island" takes this tendency to even a more extreme place, and as a result has the potential to turn off a lot of players (my college buddies from back in the day, for instance).  Appearances are ultimately deceiving however; not only is "Yoshi's Island" one of the best platformers out there, with deep, engrossing gameplay, but to fully complete the game and 100% each level is QUITE challenging.Chronologically, "Yoshi's Island" takes place very early on in Mario's history.  Given how each Zelda title keeps going further and further back, one is hesitant to call "Yoshi's Island" the first Mario game in-series, though how much further back can you go than when Mario and Luigi are babies?  This game also famously introduces Kamek, a Magi-Koopa, who would later become a major character in his own right as Bowser's premier councilor, the Consigliere (to borrow a term from "The Godfather") of the Koopa Clan.  Kamek kidnaps Baby Luigi, and it is up to a number of different Yoshis to reunite Baby Mario and Baby Yoshi.The gamplay is simple.  Navigate through each level with Yoshi to the end.  There is no health or hit points - rather, if Yoshi gets damaged, Baby Mario, with an earscreeching cry, floats off in a bubble and you have approximately ten seconds to regain Mario.  If you do not, several Magikoopas come and take Mario away and the player loses a life.  If you collect starmen, enter Middle-Rings (which function as halfway markers for the level, much like the mid-level flags in later Mario titles) or use 10-Point Stars and 20-Point Stars, you can increase this timer to a maximum of thirty secons.There are no power ups; instead, Yoshi swallows enemies, converts them into eggs (rather curiously, in a biological process nowhere elaborate upon by Nintendo) and then can shoot the eggs at various angles.  Also at various points Yoshi can turn into different vehicles (such as a helicopter or a drilling machine) by touching a vehicle transforming icon.  If Yoshi touches a star, Mario jumps off his back and becomes invincible.  Invincible Mario is the only time you actually play as Mario.  Once his invinicibility wears off, Mario is transported back to the original location of where he left Yoshi.Each level sports five flowers, twenty red coins, and thirty starmen.  To 100% the levels (and unlock the bonus level found at the end of each of the six worlds), you must find all items.  Also, the levels are LONG, and have no time limit.The music is also a strongpoint in the game, with Miyamoto praising Koji Kondo's work in one of the Iwata Asks interviews.  Kondo then told Miyamoto that was the first time he ever praised his work.  Having played "Super Mario 64" countless times over since 1996, imagine my shock to find out Wing/Vanish Mario's theme is lifted directly from the Invincibility Theme in this title!If you go in expecting a conventional Mario title, you will be disappointed. But for those looking for an excellent, engrossing platformer starring everyone's favorite Mario dinosaur, you will not be disappointed.Unfortunately, "Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island", as of November 2012, has not been released on the Wii's Virtual Console due to difficulties emulating the Super FX 2 chip.  The only way to play this fantastic game is a working SNES or if you pick up the Gameboy Advance port from 2002.

SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 3, one of the most famous games Nintendo has ever produced, came out toward in the middle of the NES console's life cycle, and brought renewed life to the aging console.  Like the original Super Mario Brothers, SMB3 became one of the biggest selling games ever.  SMB3 also brought a lot of new innovations to the Mario series, many of which can still be found today.  SMB3 regularly charts both player and critic polls as being among the best video games ever released.Released [in at the end of 1988] October 3, 1988 in Japan, SMB3 became one the Famicon's biggest sellers.  America had to wait for over a year from when Japan got it.  Originally released in some Nintendo arcade machines before it even hit stores, the buzz soon spread about the game.  This buzz was helped by the ninety minute commercial known as THE WIZARD (some people insist that it is a movie proper, but it's little more than a Nintendo advertisement) in which the climax of the movie - er, commercial - is the unveiling of SMB3, as well as revealing the secret location to the one of the warp whistles.  America finally got its hands on the game in released February 12, 1990.The game went on to sell approx. eighteen million copies, and when you include the reissues and rereleases with SUPER MARIO ALL STARS and SUPER MARIO ADVANCED, this figure swells to over thirty three million copies.  And what makes SMB3 such a successful, highly regarded title?  Read on.For the second* officially released sequel to the biggest selling game of all time, Nintendo didn't pull any stops when it came to crafting this game.  Returning to the familiar environments and gameplay of the original title, rather than the radical reinvention of SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 2, Nintendo greatly widened Mario's moves and gamestyle.  The Fire-flower and starman return.  Nintendo introduces Mario's famous raccoon suit, which enables Mario to fly briefly, and greatly opens up what is possible in level design.  New suits and powerups also include the Tanooki suit, which enables Mario to become a stone statue, a Frog suit for swimming, and Hammer Brothers suit, which enables Mario to shoot hammers.One of the biggest innovations was the inclusion of an overall game map, where Mario would move between levels.  Nintendo also used the concept (in a much different setting with a much different effect) in ZELDA II: THE ADVENTURE OF LINK, though in that title the overworld was much more important and you had a lot more freedom.  Here, the map served as a level grid in which to progress through the eight worlds.  SMB3 returns to the eight world format of the original game, rather than the seven world format of SMB2.The level design itself is where SMB3 truly shines.  First off, Nintendo returned to the original game for its basic game mechanics but [induing] ensuring Mario has a whole new bag of tricks to beat the nasty Bowser and his koopa kids.  While staying true to the overall atmosphere and play of the original title, Nintendo, over the course of eight worlds, features platforming levels that ingeniously use the game's new suits and powerups to fully integrate the player into the game's world.  Each of the eight levels is themed.  The first world is grass lands.  The second world is desert (much like the second and sixth world in SMB2).  The third is the water levels.  Where the castle is on the overworld map for World 3 is roughly a map of Japan and Tokyo.  The fourth world is the land of giants.  The fifth is the Skylands.  The sixth is frozen tundra, all ice.  The seventh is Pipeland, and the eight is Bowser's world, featuring lava, tricky airships, and challenging levels.SMB3 also introduces the seven children of King Kooper (whose the mother???), each of which rule one of the worlds and which at the end of each world you must fight in an airship.  Other innovations include minigames, new enemies (many of which would feature prominently in later titles), and the aforementioned suits.A good portion of NES games are notorious for being extremely difficult.  Some titles are damn near impossible (BATTLE TOADS, NINJA GAIDEN III), and others are filled with cheap shots and just unforgiving, unreasonable difficulty (the original MEGA MAN).  In fact, the original sequel to SUPER MARIO BROTHERS (known everywhere but Japan as THE LOST LEVELS) went unreleased in its original format stateside or in Europe for twenty one years due to difficulty and too similar to the original game.  We only just now got the title via the Virtual Console on the Wii.Fortunately, SMB3 has a very intuitive difficulty level.  As each world progresses, so does the difficulty of the levels, which culminates in the last world of Bowser, which does have some hard patches.  Overall, however, SMB3 has a medium range of difficulty, and while there are some tricky parts here and there, the game is not really that difficult and most players will be able to beat it given enough time.  Not giving too much away, SMB3 also jokingly refers to the original title after you beat Bowser, with the first words out of Princess Toadstool's mouth is "Thank you Mario, but our princess is in another castle . . . just kidding."  Strangely enough, they cut this joke in the SUPER MARIO ADVANCED reissue.Overall, SMB3 stands as one of the gaming industry's most outstanding achievements, and is one of the corner stones of the Mario Series.  As much as I love SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 2, SMB3 really felt like the true sequel to the original game, and Mario went out with a blaze of glory on the original NES with this title.  One of the greatest games ever.*Though this is the second sequel to be released and that the general public knew about, this was actually the fourth officially licensed sequel to SUPER MARIO BROTHERS.  The first, developed by Hudson Soft with Nintendo's permission, was a game called SUPER MARIO BROTHERS SPECIAL, which appeared on the obscure NEC PC-8801 in Japan only.  This is the truly forgotten Mario game, the real lost levels if you will.  Due to technical limitations, it does not scroll and the hit detection is rather off.  Nintendo had nothing to do with its development.  The second sequel is SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 2, released in 1986.  This title was released only in Japan.  The game was just like SUPER MARIO BROTHERS, but much harder.  Howard Lincoln of HOWARD AND NESTOR fame (anyone who had Nintendo Power back in the 1980s knows what I am talking about) hated the title, so they took a Japanese game called Doki Doki Panic, changed some sprites, and in 1988 released the American version of SUPER MARIO  BROTHERS 2.------------------.-----[This was written separate from the review back in May 2012 about the Mario games' development history. Notably, Miyamoto said that "Super Mario World" began development with a team of sixteen people, and took about three years to make. As "Super Mario World" came out in November 1990, that means Nintendo began production on this game sometime in 1987 - the same year they were working on "Super Mario Bros. 3". On a game forum someone asked why Nintendo did not release "Super Mario Bros. 3" on the SNES, instead of the NES, and was complaining they should have released the game on the more powerful system. This was my answer:]Let's look at some Mario history, shall we? SMB3 came out in Japan in October 1988. That means it was completed, finished, and ready to be published by that point in time.If you look at the Japanese publication dates, SMB came out in 1985, Lost Levels came out in 1986, Doki Doki Panic came out in 1987, and SMB3 came out in late 1988. Given the fact the game was finished and released by 1988 I would hardly call that "late in the NES hardware cycle". Actually, the NES had only been out three years when SMB3 hit Japan, although the Famicom came out in late 1983. However all the heavy hitters for the Famicom came out in 1985 and beyond.Essentially all Nintendo had to do at this point was release it on cart; the code was written and completed. If have a sequel to the biggest game for your console, and the sequel SMB2 is also a massive hit - why wouldn't they release SMB3 which was already completed and published in Japan? They had a massive financial interest in getting this game out.There are very few differences between the Japanese SMB3 and the western SMB3 (namely if Mario gets hit with a powerup he goes to little Mario rather than Super Mario, ala Mario with a mushroom). There's nothing like the major differences between the Japanese and the Western versions of Zelda II The Adventure of Link.All four 8-bit NES titles were completed in a three year period, 1985-1988 (and were published in Japan as well, though SMB2, there called SMB USA, came out in 1992).I've read SMB3 took about two to three years to program, meaning Nintendo began work on it possibly by late 1985 (though that does sound entirely too early) but definitely by early 1987 and possibly even late 1986 given it was released in October 1988 and both Doki Doki and Lost Levels would have been finished (in the case of Doki Doki, it would have been closed to being completed if not already completed).In comparison today, that would be like saying Nintendo should not have released "New Super Mario Bros. Wii" back in 2009 (three years into the Wii lifecycle) because obviously the Wii U is coming up and they should save it for a new system. The timeframe is the same. And according to your logic, for this generation we definitely SHOULD NOT have gotten Skyward Sword for the Wii, despite the fact it has had a five year development timeframe was began shortly after Twilight Princess came out..I do find it strange that they had problems with Yoshi (which for the record Miyamoto has said he wanted to put in the original 1985 SMB). After all, Hudson's Adventure Island series, the same company responsible for the abomination that is Super Mario Bros. Special, the first ever sequel to the Mario franchise, were able to get ridable dinasaurs, and the 1993 Capcom title Little Nemo Dream Master had ridable creatures too.Then again, Adventure Island II came out in April 1991, two and a half years after SMB3.Basically, I said all that to say you should research your Mario history more. When Nintendo began development on SMB3 (late 1986/early 1987) the Super NES was nowhere on the horizon, at least not publically. Even in late 1988 when the game was published, we were still over two years away from the Super Famicom which came out in Japan in November of 1990.So that's why they didn't develop it for the Super Famicom.

This game has a quick start and a daily program.  The quick start does a rudimentary assessment of your visual age.  There are 4 profiles that you can create for each member of a small family or a group of friends.  Based upon your speed and how well you perform, it compares your chronological age with your visual age.Two types of training are available, sports and basic training.  Tests are used to determine a broader scope of your visual age.  Hand-Eye Coordination, Peripheral Vision, Dynamic Visual Acuity, Momentary Vision and Eye Movement are tested using various specific tasks.  At the conclusion of daily training, you have eye relaxation exercises with voice prompts.  You can do the 5 programmed training lessons based upon your visual age or you can do a custom program.  With each skill set, there is a "normal" and "advanced" level.  Only data from the first task is saved.  There are charts that plot your progress/improvement or decline in skills.Overall, this is a simplistic program that will help your visual abilities on a daily basis.  It is a great cognitive tool for adults and kids to play.I highly recommend this program.
I love Wii Fit Plus.  I just bought it yesterday at Walmart.  I have started with just Wii Fit alone, and had found that Nintendo had released this second disc.  This is by far the better of the two.When I first bought my Wii Fit, I used it to do the Body Test every morning.  I continue to do so, and religiously keep track of my weight progress on my wall calendar.  I enjoyed the convenience of the Wii Fit Channel, and have replaced it with the Wii Fit Plus Channel.  I have noticed that Nintendo has obviously made quite a few improvements upon the software.The Body Test experience with the Wii Fit Plus Channel is very similar to the original.  However, when you step on the balance board to be measured for your Center Of Balance and Body Mass Index, the software tells you to keep still.  The original Wii Fit software does not.I also find that some of the exercises on the original Wii Fit you have to unlock by doing others.  I've noticed that this is not true with Wii Fit Plus.  Most of the exercises on Wii Fit Plus start out unlocked, and are never locked.  This way you have a greater choice of exercise activities to choose from when working out with Wii Fit Plus, rather than with original Wii Fit.I am glad that I purchased this software.  It increases my motivation and use of Wii Fit.  If you purchase a copy, you perhaps can follow me down the path of fun and easygoing exercise and weight loss.
The Wii Fit is a great addition to the Wii system, while it is not a substitute to get out and hitting the gym or doing some road miles, it is a fun way of getting into a home exercise routine. If you don't have a Yoga instructor handy, the Wii provides one for one, including some fun and tough poses. The four areas of training on the Fit, other than the Yoga are Strength, Aerobics and the Balance games. The strength training is cool, I generally never bothered with push-ups until now, that and other exercises you can include your own free-weights with are addictive with the Wii points and unlocking of reps and routines. The step aerobics are fun and more useful than the Fit's jogging in place while exploring the virtual island.But, the hula hoop with multiple hoops are a super workout. Finally, the Wii Fit's games to aid in balance are fun and sometimes pretty hard, rolling marbles into platform holes, tightrope walking, soccer heading and more unlockables.The Fit evaluates your Body Mass Index, weight and balance, keeps track of your progress and more. One downside, is while aiding you in tracking wt. and such, if you are overweight (according to ht. and age norms) it will tell you where you need to be and the body shape of your Mii (or the character representing you) will be "subtlely" altered, but only in the opening BMI section, which you can skip. Also, the ladies (or gents) who want to keep their wt. a secret can put a password on their profile, too.Down the line their are more Fit tie-ins on the way, using the board for skating and Rayman's Rabbid's are on the way with one, as well. I recommend the charger, while the board doesn't drink batteries like the remotes, it is still a good idea. As is the skin to protect your board and yoga mat to protect you.
I purchased the Wii Fit because I wanted to become more active.  In this, the Wii Fit excels.  The cornerstone is the Wii Fit balance board.  This board looks and acts like a scale.  In fact, it has several sensors, so it can sense how you are distributing your weight on the board.This is the core of how Wii Fit works.  When you start Wii Fit, you must pick a Mii to represent you.  Once you have done this, you need to enter your birthday.  Then, if you want to keep your weight and records private, you may enter a password.After this, you may choose a weight loss goal for yourself---how many pounds and how many weeks or months to achieve it.  Every 2 weeks you may change this goal.After choosing a goal, you can perform the Test.  The test will measure your weight and your balance (how centered you are between your left and right feet, and how centered your weight is over your feet).After taking the Test (you may record the results once each day), you will get a Wii Fit age.  The closer you are to your ideal weight, and the better you perform on the balance and agility tests, the lower the Wii Fit age will be.After this, you may perform some Training.  In Training, there are several categories---Yoga, Strength Training, Aerobics, Balance Games (Favorites keeps the 10 most frequent activities).  The more time you spend doing these mini-games, the more things you will unlock.I find the mini-games to be a lot of fun.  Many of them will help improve your balance and body awareness, directly or indirectly (because that is what the board is measuring).  However, unless you are careful, you can easily overdo it and hurt yourself badly.  For example, doing the push-ups incorrectly can dislocate your shoulder.In addition, do NOT rely on the Wii Fit for a precise weight measurement.  When sitting on a medium depth pile carpet, the Wii Fit measured my weight as about 20 pounds lighter than I am.  I've also seen my "weight" go up or down by 2 pounds when my regular scale shows a difference of less than a pound.Beyond that, the games may require you to take poses that aren't comfortable for your body (the board is fairly small).Just like with Big Brain Academy (Wii Degree), don't take the Wii Fit's results too seriously.  The game may say you are Overweight or Obese.  If anything, take that as a challenge to be a bit more active.If you want a video game that is a lot of fun, and can get you more active, by all means get a Wii Fit.  I enjoy it.  However, the Wii Fit cannot replace a good physical trainer.  Let your body tell you what feels right.Slow and steady is the best way to start any physical activity.
Love it! Ever dreamed of flapping your arms and flying? You can with Wii Plus. You can bicycle around WuHu Island, have a snowball fight, or even be a circus juggler. There are target specific workouts to try out. You can customize your own workout or let the Wii board choose for you in five minute increments. Only got a minute to get weighed in? Wii Fit Plus can do that! New is the MET feature and Wii Piggy will keep track of calories burned too. For less than $20, this is a "must have" for Wii Fit owners. Wii motion plus attachment not needed for this program.
Wii Fit is the next logical step after people across the country developed weight loss plans around playing tennis, boxing and bowling on Wii Sports.  This "game" borrows the exercise/conditioning elements of Wii Sports and builds them into a full exercise program.  Although none of the 40 exercises in Wii Fit offer the enjoyment of playing tennis against a friend, the plethora of options in this package breaks the monotony of people who tried playing tennis alone everyday for 30 minutes, followed by 15 minutes of boxing, etc.The groundbreaking technology behind Wii Fit is the balance board.  It accurately measures every subtle movement and momentum nuance as you step and shift. It independently analyzes the input from your left and right foot, compiling the data to tell you if you are performing the activities correctly.  You overall health score is determined not just by how much you weigh, but by how quick, balanced and precise you are able to move.The second real jewel of Wii Fit is the daily check-in, where your weight, BMI and balance are all calculated and tracked.  I believe the exercises with Wii Fit should be done in conjunction with more legit activities (jogging/walking, playing basketball, swimming, etc) for best results, but the check-in option rivals and betters anything you could gain by going to weekly visits to Weight Watchers or other exercise plan providers.  Having your weight and fitness age on display each day is a great motivator.Wii Fit isn't a perfect workout tool by any means.  But it is a really innovative program  that features a robust list of exercise "games" and creates an environment in which working out is less daunting.  I also believe it will springboard people into more legit forms of exercise.  If you really want to lose weight, starting out with Wii Fit is a great first step.  Even as your fitness increases and the exercises contained become less challenging, you'll still continue to use the BMI calculator to track your progress.  That alone is almost worth the price, but for most of us, reaching that stage would be months if not years away.
I discovered that I purchased my Wii Fit exactly a year ago today. Back on May 23, 2008 I weighed 298 pounds. A whole year later, I have slimmed down to 256.4 pounds. That's a total of 41.6 pounds of weight lost inside a years time.I love my Wii Fit very much, I do my daily Body Test every morning as soon as I roll out of bed.  Once I get my COB, my BMI, and my weight readings, I write my weight on the calendar.  I go through this process religiously each and every morning.If I can lose as much weight as I have with my Wii Fit, plus my will power, exercise, diet, and permanent health kick, you can do it too.  So what are you waiting for?  Purchase a Wii Fit and follow in my lead today.  Who knows, in one years time, you could lose more weight than me.
I can see why this is so intriguing and such a HIT with women esp stay home mums.A range of interesting exercises to choose from. Cardio, Stretching, Yoga, Running and other fun sports like Skiing, Tightrope walking etc  Your kids will love it too.A personal coach and inbuilt tracking system to trace your progress. Weight, BMI over time.The balancing board checks your portage, balance and helps you correct your posture.Get one already!
The other night, after indulging in some greasy lower-Manhattan takeout, I received my Wii Fit from Amazon.  I put the box near the television, took some Rolaids, and resigned to test-drive Nintendo's new fitness machine in the morning.The next morning I warmed myself up for a high-tech exercise experience by playing some of Marvel's Ultimate Alliance and some Paper Mario on the Wii's Virtual Console.  After a few of hours warming up my fingers, I was ready for the Wii Fit.The game is simple enough to setup; the installation of some batteries and an uneventful synch up of the Wii Fit Balance Board with the Wii console are about it.My first session with the Wii started with entering the date, my age, getting weighed, and an initial body balance test.  Wii Fit used those data to calculate my Wii Fit age, an embarrassing 47, about 12 years ahead of my actual age. I immediately repeated the body test and scored an ego boosting age of 31.  Much relieved, I listened as the Wii helped me set fitness goals. It told me I should shoot for a body mass index of 21 instead of my 24 (i.e., lose some weight).Based on my Wii fit experience so far, the technology's strength lies in two areas. First is its variety. There's a large variety of strength, balance, aerobic, and stretching (yoga) exercises, with additional exercises unlocked after completing basic sessions. The more you use Wii Fit, the larger the selection of exercises.Wii Fit's second strength comes in its coordination of the balance board and the Wii's position sensing tech. The system does a good job of tracking where the user is and integrating that into game play.I like Wii Fit's aerobic exercises the best. In the meat-world, I enjoy running, so it wasn't really a surprise that I liked Wii Fit's running exercises. It gives me the opportunity to run with a dog, something my real dog shrugs off all requests for (She usually responds to my requests to run with a "you're joking right?" look.). If you have other Mii's on your Wii, you'll occasionally see them run by you. There`s also a never-ending supply of people waving at you and cheering you on during runs. Before Wii Fit, I'd never would have guessed running in place could be anything but boring and awkward.Again, the Wii's positioning system seems well suited to keeping track of my running-in-place gate. The running exercises start with short intervals and work up to a free run mode.  Be sure to wear sneakers while Wii Fit running.  Running in place can be hard on the forefeet.On the down side of the aerobic games, Wii Step seems to be a bit on the slow side. It's like a lazy Dance Dance Revolution.  It's not that Wii Step is boring, it offers some insanely catchy, but unvaried, music and the advanced version of the game is fairly challenging. The problem is that Wii Step didn't offer much of a workout.  In the accompanying video, when I look at my watch, I wasn't checking the time, I was checking my heart rate.  My average heart rate during Wii Step clocked in at around 110bpm, about my heart rate during moderate walking. Still, the ability of the balance board to detect my position was a real high point of Wii Step. Also, I swear I saw Greg Allman in the audience watching the virtual step class.I also haven't been able to get the hang of the aerobic boxing class.  Wii Fit consistently misses my left, or I have a terrible left. I can't tell which. On the plus side, the boxing exercises push my heart rate higher than the step classes do.  The boxing sessions also have the interesting initial shock of suddenly appearing shirtless with an overly butch shirtless man.The strength and yoga exercises are not as fun-oriented as the balance and cardio exercises, but are focused and straightforward with good instruction from very non-Nintendo appearing fitness trainers.  I'd never attempted any yoga until Wii Fit and was able to follow the exercises and feel like I was accomplishing some real stretching. The pushups with side-planks also offer a decent body-weight workout.Wii Fit's balance games have offered me the most challenges.  They're fun too. You get to play as a fishing penguin on an ice-float; see your Mii's transformed into rolling balls; play a boy in the bubble floating on a river; and do some skiing. A note on the skiing: the slalom steering is exactly the opposite of what you do during actual skiing (In the game, leaning to the left makes you go left.). That took some getting used to.According to my exercise watch, I've been burning between 300-450 calories per 45-55 minute session. That's less than what I'd burn at the gym, but more than what I'd burn playing Zelda, Super Mario Galaxy, or even Resident Evil IV.I'm enjoying Wii Fit and I can feel some muscle soreness in my hips from the strength and yoga exercises I did yesterday.  I think that's the point of Wii Fit.  It offers palatable exercise in the privacy and convenience of my home. I'm more likely to play Wii Fit after a long day at work than I am to pack up my equipment and run to the gym.The only other note I'll make is that after four days of play, at about forty-five minutes per session, I've already had to replace the Wii Balance Board's four AA's. Having rechargeable on dock is advisable.
Although I enjoy using the Wii Fit, perhaps the most frustrating aspect is the short duration of most of the exercises, with lots of button pushing in between.  Especially when you're first beginning and haven't unlocked some of the longer exercises, you can spend an hour and a half completing just 45 minutes of actual exercises.  Supposedly, theWii Fit Plus, if you already have Wii Fit or theWii Fit Plus with Balance Board, if you need the board, solves this problem for yoga and strength exercises, not aerobics.Because I was already somewhat in shape when I started, most of the exercises do not sufficiently sustain an elevated heart rate.  The free run and step programs do better, but these must be unlocked by good scores in other areas.  However, for those who are just embarking on an exercise program, I cannot imagine a better tool, especially since the trainer (you can choose male or female) and the tiny Wii voice encourage the user to continue.  The games keep your attention, and even the runs provide moving scenery to keep things interesting.  You'll probably find, as I did, that some games are tough to figure out right away, and so, once you realize how to score well, you'll improve, and there's nothing like beating your old record.The Wii works in two main sections, body measurement/testing and training/exercises.  The measurement keeps track of your weight, records your goals, calculates BMI, graphs progress, and gives balance tests to determine your Wii Fit "age."  (Expect to peel off those first "years" by figuring out what the Wii wants.)  If you don't want other people in your house knowing your weight, BMI, etc., you can lock your profile and measurements using a PIN code.  The exercise section is broken down into yoga, aerobics, strength training, and balance games, with the Wii keeping track of your history.The biggest advantage of Fit is the way it helps time pass quickly.  Before you know it, you'll have logged in thirty minutes of exercise.  Although people swear by the Fit for weight loss, you'll get quicker and more permanent results with diet changes as well.  If you already have an exercise outlet or if the weather prevents you from following your usual sport, the Wii makes an excellent supplement.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann

Over the yrs, handheld ports of MK games have ranged from absolutely abysmal to merely embarrassing(AHEM...MK Advance), so DA deserves special mention for even displaying a level of competence. The sound is great with good vioce samples and surprisingly potent smacking sounds, and the tight conrols retain an impressive amount of 12 characters maoves, stances, and fatalities. And just like it's console bretheren, there's tons of stuff to unlock, even if it's mostly character palete swaps. The most unfortunate thing about GBA DA is the decision to ape the console version's 3D gameplay when it really wasn't neccessary,the arenas are blocky Mode-7 messes that do impossible Escher things whenever the floor meets the background, and the characters have been pixelated to make the "scale". 10 for ambition, at any rate, great game Capcom, keep up the good work.

This is, possibly, the single best platform game I have played. Ever.I know it's better than Rayman 2. And that was a five star effort.Basically, everything about this game just oozes quality. The graphics are as beautiful as ever, infact more beautiful than ever. Some of the bosses in particular are just jaw-dropping.The sound is that typical UbiSoft Rayman beautiful-world symphony, except with a bit of an edge to it this time. It still sounds beautiful, and fits perfectly, except it now sounds like it was composed this century. Personal highlights of the soundtrack are the first Reflux boss and The Summit Beyond The Clouds.Gameplay is more varied than ever. You'll platform it up a la Rayman 2. You'll shoot on rails a la Panzer Dragoon. You'll snowboard a la Sonic Adventure. You'll solve the most ingenious platform puzzles you ccould think of. And you'll do other stuff. Stuff I can't even describe. Like I once said reviewing Rayman 2, you'll do things that other companies need to sit down and have explained to them by a man with a large whiteboard.Lastability-wise, not only are there tons of mini-games to unlock, but there's also the high score challenge, complete with online world ranking at Raymanzone.com.But the best bit? THe presentation. Rayman has lost slightly the cutesy edge he acquired in R2, largely thanks to some great dialogue and fantastic voice acting. Including Billy West (Ren and Stimpy, Futurama, etc.) as the disgruntled, manual-badmouthing tutorial host Murfy and John Leguizamo (Ice Age, etc.) as the slightly-drunken (on plum juice) Globox. There's lots of self-referential humor as well ^_^Order it from these lovely Amazon.compeople NOW.

Okey, this game is great, but since when does Shigeru Miyamoto-san (no I'm not trying to act like I know japanese, but Mr. Miyamoto disserves to be treated with respect) not direct Mario Game, MARIO WAS HIS IDEA. That's why this got 4 stars instead of 5.Now, onto the game.Graphics 9/10Great graphics, fantastic water effects, When Mario steps in goo (you'll find out about that when you play, I make it a point not to give away the stroy, just to review it.) the goo will stay on you, untill you get wet or shake it off of course. You'll also leave footprints, and when you slide in it, the goo will cover any part of your body that touches it, it's funny seeing mario with green and yellow stuff all over his face.Sound 8/10Fantastic, the opening scene has full voice acting, a first for mario games, a very tropicle soundtrack. You can even hear the wave hitting the beach. Just Amazing How Far Technolegy has brought us since the little beeps of the first mario game.Replay Value 10/10There are 120 shine sprites to collect. And in order to get them all you must but 24 of them by finding 240 blue coins(10 blue coins each) No easy task, this will take months to acomplish even for veteran gamers. Mainly because there are ONLY 240 blue coins in the whole game, some are easy to find others just to hard. I suggest buying a Player's Guide, Which I am Usually Against DoingOverall 9/10Great Game. Graet Graphis. Great Sound. Great Replay Value.But One Of My Favorite Things Is the return of Yoshi. And Mario's shirt is short-sleeved. For 20 years he's worn that old longsleeved shirt (most people don't know that his overalls used to be red with a blue shirt).Also, when you get 30 stars, you can go to this guy on the beach (he's also in most of the levels)And, he'll give you sunglasses. Most of all they darken the screen somewhat (which is good this game is way to bright)Ounce you beat the last boss (my lips are sealed) You can go to him for a hawaiin t-shirt (it's not really hawaiin, more like delfinoin because it has shine sprites not flowers).

This is a game that has 3 wordgames in one game: Crosswords, Wordsearches, and AnagramsCrosswords- I don't really do crosswords but in this game they give you easy mode, so I do the easy crosswords and usually do okay on them, and they also give you hints if you get stuck on them, but if you do hints it will add extra time on it. As you progress more crosswords will unlock and so will the levels of diffculty.Wordsearches- The wordsearches are the main reason why I brought this game because I love doing wordsearches. The wordsearches have 3 levels of diffculty. I unlocked all the easy and medium puzzles and as you progress though it more puzzles will unlock.Anagrams- For these puzzles I think you have to complete 3 of them until you unlock all the levels: short, medium, and long. This is almost like jumbles( I like jumbles)Overall if you like word games I recommed you to buy it.
I bought this game strictly for the easier crosswords, but soon started dabbling with the other games - Wordsearch and Anagrams.Much to my complete surprise I got hooked on the Wordsearch games and what makes it so surprising is that I never liked Wordsearch games before!  In the magazines, I hated these things!  But I really like this!I find that the touch screen is more responsive and recognizes the letters easier than some of the other DS games that use this lettering on the touch screen.I also like "The New York Times Crosswords" game, but this game is great if you just want to sit back, relax and play at an easier pace.It's staying in my stash of games permanently.
This game not only includes crosswords, but word finds and anagrams. All games can be selected for size (small, medium and large puzzles) and its worthwhile owning, if you want a portable pick-up and go word game similar to the penny game books you find in the grocery stores.

I was so amazed at the night and day thing. The Pokemon were so so cute and I easily got attached. Me and my bro got this in October 2000 and we were so hooked!I had Silver (the better one) and he owned Gold.My favorite starter is definitely Totadile but I think that I picked Chikarita most of the time.My favorite Pokemon in this game are:Umbreon, Totadile, Sneasle, Dragonite, Staryu, Bulbasaur, Growlithe, Vulpix, Jynx, Tediursa, Espeon, Blastoise, Pikachu and Snorlax.The Trainers in the game were Bird Trainer (I forgot Him), Bugsy the Bug Trainer, Whitney the Normal Pokemon trainer, The adorable Ghost Trainer Morty, Jasmine The Steel Pokemon trainer, the Fighting Pokemon Trainer, Pryce the Ice Trainer and the Dragon Master, Claire. >_&lt;.It's so much fun trying to train all of these Pokemon. Only the addicted Poke-maniacs will get to do it!Bravo to the last great Pokemon title.Ruby and Pearl were an embarrassment although Ruby's graphics improved over Silver and Pearl had the cutest addition to the Poke-Roster.This is the best Pokemon game so far. You are a fool if you don't play this one first or next!

Pokemon Diamond, Pearl and Platinum are all very good games that all take place in the sinnoh region. But if you had one to pick, get Platinum.Why?Platinum has legendary Pokemon Palkia, Dialga AND Giratina as the storyline's main Pokemon! (Pearl only has Palkia and Giratina and Diamond only has Dialga and Giratina)Platinum has 210 Pokemon to discover in the story mode!!! (Diamond and Pearl only has 150 Pokemon to discover in the story mode)Platinum has more better 3-d graphics then Diamond and Pearl.Platinum has more new places then Diamond and Pearl (the battleground for instance)Platinum has upgraded gyms!and much more!Platinum is "a better seqeul" to Diamond and Pearl so if you had to pick, Platinum is the answer!
A note: This review does NOT apply to Pokemon Emerald, Ruby and Sapphire's counterpart, since I have not played Pokemon Emerald.Ahh, Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire. By far some of the best games in Pokemon history so far. (Pokemon Firered in close second.)Longtime Pokemon fans with obviously enjoy this great game,(Like myself) and it will surely introduce many new fans to the series.You start out as either a male or female trainer. After a bit of talking, you discover that the town's local professor, Professor Birch, (Yes, as in a Birch tree) being cornered by a grumpy Poochyena. You grab one of the Pokemon from his bag, (A Treeko, grass type, Torchic, Fire type, or Mudkip, water type) And use it to defend the professor. That Pokemon will become your first ever Pokemon. And so, the adventure begins! (Geez, what a cliche'd line, lol.)Anyway, this game has many, many, (Insert the word 'many' a whole bunch of times ^-^) new features.First of all, a huge bundle of brand new Pokemon! And now, thanks to Pokemon Firered and leafgreen, you can get the 151 of the Kanto region in here too! Sadly, there are no new Pokemon Gold/Silver remakes...yet.Plus, there are Contests! Contests are special...well...contests, based on several categories, like Beauty, Tough, and Cute. Raise your pokemon to fit Contest form with Pokeblocks, a special candy that increases it's Coolness, Cuteness, Toughness, etc. Pokemon moves are also categorized. Such as, Bubble is a Cute move, and Brick Break is a Tough move, therefore, they can be used in their respective contests.There are also Natures, which can affect the way a Pokemon grows. Examples of Natures are: Relaxed, or Brave. Also, they affect the types of Pokeblocks a Pokemon likes.Abilities are another new feature. They are basically, special Pokemon abilities. Such as, the ability, Keen Eye. A Pokemon with the Keen Eye ability stops accuracy reduction in battle. Very, very useful!!Plus, a herd of new Pokemon moves! And, a bundle of new Pokeballs!The main Legendary Pokemon are Groudon, Kyogre, and Rayquaza. You can get Rayquaza in both games, but Groudon is only in Ruby, and Kyogre is only in Sapphire. But, if you own Pokemon Emerald, you can get all three!There are also even more Legendaries! Latios, Latias, Regirock, Registeel, Regice, Jirachi, and Deoxys.Well, that's pretty muhc all I'll tell you. I don't want to ruin any surprises. But, here are a few helpful tricks and tips:* As I have said in a Pokemon Firered reviews, DON'T Use all uber Legendaries. For one, no one will battle you, in fear of getting creamed, and second, it's not original. Nowadays, EVERYONE uses all Legendary teams in Official Competitons, and there's no variety, and no challenge to win. -_-; Not so 'Legendary' any more, huh?*CATCH SHINY POKEMON. Do I need to underline it? They are Pokemon colored differently than usual, and SUPER rare. I have not encountered one yet on my Ruby and Sapphire versions, but I have a Shiny Graveler on Firered. They are recognizable by a shimmery glow of stars around them, and their different colors. If you see one, CATCH IT!*Plant Berries! Currently, on Sapphire, I used up all the game's berries, and I can't plant many more. (I think I have the dreaded Berry Glitch) Berries are useful in battle, and are used to make Pokeblocks for Pokemon Contests.*This isn't really a tip...more of an evaluation. If you are a Newbie to Pokemon games, don't choose Torchic. It is weak to many Gym leaders, but is great for expierienced trainers. (I have a Blaziken, evolves form of Torchic, and let me tell you, it was touhg deafeatinbg Roxanne, a Rock type gym leader.) Treecko would be a better chocie, since it is strong against more Gym Leaders than the other two. Mudkip will be good for intermediate players.Well, that's all!

The graphics are piss-poor but the game play and music rarely get better.Bulbasaur is better than any other starter ever and always will be. Charmander was cute but not as cool. And Squirtle as adorable as he was was way too slow.The madness never stopped in my house once me and my bro (22 and 16 now) got these into our grubby paws. We did next to no trading, but tons of gaming.33 Pokemon that are in this title are:Bulbasaur, Meowth, Persian, Starmie, Dragonair, Koffing, Weezing, Ekans, Arbok, Seel, Dewgong, Zapdos, Geodude, Graveler, Golem, Vulpix, Vileplume, Articuno, Electabuzz, Ponyta, Gloom, Tangela, Lickitung, Mewtwo, Chansey, Taurus, Jynx, Oddish, Golbat, Horsea, Dragonite, Diglett and Magmar.It's only better because Pikachu follows you everywhere, has a feelings meter and can surf if you know how to access it. Also, an extra point because Team Rocket unsuccessfully crashes your party. Priceless, really. And *JUST* like the anime. =^)Game play : A-Sound : B-Originality : D- (bit off of Blue and Red's style like Woah. The only thing remotely original was the fact that your yellow, adorable Pikachu followed you and he surfed.And remember the 3 starters from Blue/Red (Bulba, Charm and Squirt? If you play your cards right you can have them all, helping create a wonderous team to be reckoned with! Also Team Rocket tried and failed each time to ambush your journey throughout Kanto! &lt;/X^D)Story: C-Trading : A-Fun : AReplay : A++Overall : B-4.1 stars.

The world of Pokemon took the world by strom when it was released.  Pokemon are animals with special powers.  Some people keep Pokemon as pets, but most people train thier pokemon for battle!  In a Pokemon battle, nobody dies, they just "faint" or knocked-out but not dead.  You can carry up to six pokemon in pokeballs.Pokemon Gold takes place in the Johto region, which is different from the Kanto (the old world in Pokemon Blue, Red and Yellow) region.  In this game, you can breed your own pokemon! Pokemon finally have Male and Female--the male pokemon are a little stronger than females.  A addictive game!

Before he was convicted of sexual assault, before he beat his wife half to death, and before he bit Evander Hollyfield's ear, Mike Tyson signed a deal with Nintendo to make a video game that pits a wiery-looking teenager nick-named Little Mac against (in order of appearance) Glass Joe, Von Kaiser, Piston Honda, Don Flaminco, The Hippo King, Great Tiger, Bald Bull, Piston Honda again, Soda Popinski, Don Flaminco again, Bald Bull again, Mr. Sandman, Super Macho Man, then eventually Mike Tyson. The bad news: You're not Mike Tyson, you're Little Mac. Fortunately, you have a chubby coach in your corner with a never-say-die attitude and a shiny pink bike (who says gay people have no place in video games?).So while the game isn't 2-players and you can't fight as Mike Tyson, it's still one of the best boxing video games you'll ever play.

This game is so fun. It has archery, bowling, basketball, swor play, skydiving, cycling, frisbee , wakeboarding, power cruising, golf, table tennis, canoeing, and air sports. I wish it had baseball. The grafics are better and you get this controller device called the wii motion plus that improves your motions with the wii remote. I reccommend buying this product.
(Quick Note: The only difference between "Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!" and "Punch-Out!" is that after Iron Mike signed a contract to be in the game, the gap-toothed puncher was convicted of rape and sentenced to hard time. Not wanting that kind of bad press directed at them, Nintendo re-released the game with Tyson being replaced by the crew-cut Mr. Dream, who shares the EXACT same punches and mannerisms as Tyson).Since I was given my first Nintendo Entertainment System in 1991, I have been a devoted brand-loyalist my entire life, playing such systems as the Super Nintendo, Nintendo '64, Gamecube, and the Wii. Through that lineage, I was able to see video games "grow up", in a manner of speaking, what with the introduction of 3-D game play with Mario '64, the explosion of the Madden Football series, and the new motion-sensor interface of the Wii. Yet, through all those great games and innovative ideas, it is still a simple boxing game that charms me every time.I think that the biggest appeal of "Punch-Out!" is its quirkiness. You play as Little Mac, a scrawny little fighter who must take on other pugilists both man and animal alike! There's Don Flamenco and his corny dances, Magic Tiger with his spinning knockout punch, and Bald Bull with his "Bull Charge". Plus, fighters like Piston Honda (obviously the Asian representative), Soda Popinski (a knock-off from the arcade game's Vodka Drunkenski, which Nintendo tamed down a bit), and Mr. Sandman are also quite colorful and interesting. With a cast of characters like that (including more that I'm not even mentioning here), how could the game not be engaging, as players wait breathlessly to see which oddball will come out of the woodwork next!Of course, the challenge of the game is also what keeps players coming back for more. At first, you will hardly be able to defeat "Glass Joe", a wimpy fighter who is little more than a punching bag. However, as you begin to learn the basic controls, you will be able to advance to the next fighter, who always has something else up his sleeve. Each fighter also has their own individual "tells" (Piston Honda's eyebrows, various sound cues, etc.), which (once studied) can give you an edge in defeating them. If you have not played this game, I cannot put into words the joyful feeling of, having toiled to defeat a particular fighter time and time again, you finally put him on the mat for good!About the only criticism I have of "Punch-Out!" is that, right at the very end, the difficulty level rises into the stratosphere. From Glass Joe to Super Macho Man and all fighters in between, they can be beaten by any decent gamer who puts in some time and effort. For Tyson/Dream, however, your reflexes need to be honed to nearly those of a cat in order to defeat him. However, that "weakness" also makes the game enjoyable after being defeated for the umpteenth time, as no matter how good you think you are, Tyson/Dream will give you the video game challenge of a lifetime.So, I would highly recommend this game to ANY video game enthusiast out there (not just boxing fans). In today's world of complicated games that often have side-quests that can seemingly last forever, it is refreshing to find a game that is so simple and straightforward, yet challenging and engaging. Plus, if you are nostalgic for the NES whatsoever, this game will slip back into your gaming identity much like a boxing glove slips onto Little Mac's determined hands.

Oh well where to start. well if you like to knock out boxers from all over the world up-close, using your trusty uppercut and low blows and star punches this for you. go up against boxers like Bald Bull, Piston Honda, Mr. sandman. Super Macho Man,Don Flamico King Hippo who by the way doesn't bother to get up at all after u knock him down the first time lol!i remember back when i was 10 in 1988 playing this with a friends. then i purchased Punch out in 1990 a cheap rip off this  game except for the last boxer who looks like mike tyson except he called mr. Dream. i think maker made that game Punch ou because mike tyson was in trouble with the law in the late 1980's or he had some kind of scandal going on. so they remade the game punch -out.when you finally reached Mike Tyson himself his puches will KO u in the first minute  and a half. then he will blink his eye and throw puches till he first round is over. you may have to and probably will go 3 rounds with him. once your score get past 5000 you can beat him by a split decison. so go on turn on mike tyson's punch out now an Ko him the hell out!peace ..fellow gamers and retro gamers..!!

I've played Rayman2 and loved so I just couldn't help getting the third installment.  Raymans adventure begins when a red lum scared to death by something turns into crazed blacklums, the blacklum multiplies until only blacklums are left in the core of the world.  After a couple of levels Globox swallows Andre, king of blacklums and those hoodlums won't give globox any peace until Andre comes out, meanwhile you as Rayman need to beat wacked-out levels to get to doctors and free globox of his pesky blacklum.  Thats all really, just one level I need to warn you about, the desert of Knaaren, those guys are creepy!  First they capture globox then they chase you, not to mention they're invinsible AND say weird stuff like &quot;brains&quot; and &quot;tastes better salted&quot;  they are the real meaning of depressing.  Now go buy it!!!!!

Rayman 3, Hoodlum Havoc is tops in all the catagories.  Wonderful music, beautiful color, fun bonus games, lots of locations.  The thing that really starts you out with a bang is Murphy, Rayman's sidekick and your personal, mouthy tutor.  He goes one on one with you with assorted, hilarious insults if you don't perform well during the tryouts.  My efforts were nothing short of pitiful.  His choice remark that just about made fall off the chair laughing was.  &quot;What's the matter with you.  Haven't you ever played a video game before?&quot;

Cutesy therapeutic Marioland like fun with a bouncy blob that acquires different powers as it picks up "potions" along the way...A cute blend of Sonic in Marioland except with a bouncy blob.  Kids will love this.  Adults wouldn't mind it either for a while.
I have WL1,3 an 4 but i beat all of them. I played this a long time ago (first WL game i played) at friends house an i wanted a copy but gamestore didnt have copy of game at the time but they had wario land 3 so i got it (wario land 4 and the GBA didnt come out yet) then when gba an WL4 came out i got that but my friend didnt manage to get a GBA but got WL2 (luckily) an i played an beat it an thats how i beat all WL games. I played super mario land but not the 2nd one but i didnt really like it (its just me thats all). an a few days ago i got this game at gamestore! u should get it too cuz it leaves off after marioland 2 (i know the plot from end of SML2-WL4) ill explain the  storyEND of SML2- Mario defeated wario an got his castle back and warios attempt to take over marioland failed...WL3:SML3- Wario realy wanted a castle but didnt know how to get one until he remembered a rumor about a gang of thieves (forgot name) stole a giant peach/toadstool statue that mario ( yes Mario) was forever  lookin for an Wario thot if he found it first, he could sell it for $$$ to the royal family so he headed off for his gold...and castle of coarse...this is where U come in to help wario on his journey....You can get this game at some Gamestop stores, here from a seller, ebay,etc. its not that hard to find really an 15-20$ is a good deal for this game. WL4 is the easiest to get, then WL3, then WL1 (in my area) but WL2 is quite difficult to find...have fun with this game!

I played super mario land but not the 2nd one but i didnt really like it (its just me thats all). an a few days ago i got this game at gamestore! u should get it too cuz it leaves off after marioland 2 (i know the plot from end of SML2-WL4) ill explain the  storyEND of SML2- Mario defeated wario an got his castle back and warios attempt to take over marioland failed...WL3:SML3- Wario realy wanted a castle but didnt know how to get one until he remembered a rumor about a gang of thieves (forgot name) stole a giant peach/toadstool statue that mario ( yes Mario) was forever  lookin for an Wario thot if he found it first, he could sell it for $$$ to the royal family so he headed off for his gold...and castle of coarse...this is where U come in to help wario on his journey....You can get this game at some Gamestop stores, here from a seller, ebay,etc. its not that hard to find really an 15-20$ is a good deal for this game. WL4 is the easiest to get, then WL3, then WL1 (in my area) but WL2 is quite difficult to find...have fun with this game!
Reggie Fils Aime said that nintendo had PWNED the PSP so yeah it must be good.......
History:It all started as a platform game with 2D graphics in the Playstation. Then, the sequel came out for both the Nintendo64 and the playtation, called Rayman 2:The Great Escape. Years later, Ubi-soft decided to add the Rayman 2 for the Playstation2 with some changes and improves, called Rayman 2:Revolution. And now, the third part is near for all consoles and the pc, called Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc.How famous is Rayman?It is considered that Rayman is Ubi-soft's most famous character.What type of game is Rayman?It is a platform game, which means it involves lots of jumping, climbing, and adventure (Like Mario style). Platform games are not a type of combat action game, you don't fight that much in platform titles. I mean, you do have weapons and items to destroy bad guys, but the platform games are more of the jumping action (jump from tree to tree, climb risks, swim, etc.). But Rayman breaks the definition of the platform games. It involves plenty of bad guys, combats, and action. Does this make it a bad platform title? NOPE! It improves the platforming games.Features of Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc- Rayman's in prime form with new high-tech powers and gear like Shock Rockets, the LockJaw, FunkyBoards, and other cool stuff.- Charge into intense strategic battles with the crazed Hoodlum Army and massive transforming bosses.- Plunge into enormous, eye-popping worlds packed with zany comedy and a wacked-out cast, featuring John Leguizamo as Globox.Why is Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc a must buy?Because it features one of the best characters in the videogame world, the previously released titles of Rayman have been a complete master piece, the graphics have improved incredibly, the worlds are bigger than ever, the genre has been evolved, the weapons and battle system have been changed and improved to best, and because its a platform title no one can miss.

The meat of this game is the 120 brainteasers contained, and sometimes hidden, within the Curious Village.There is an overall mystery surrounding a Golden Apple, as well as some additional mysteries happening in the village, but you will not be solving those mysteries directly.  In fact, the mysteries are so contrived they are not solvable by the game player.  Instead, the mystery solutions are revealed to you as you progress through the game.So what will you be doing? You'll be solving the brainteasers the residents of the Curious Village toss at you as you walk around investigating the mysteries.  The riddles range from very simple (10 points) to very hard (70 points).In the simplest riddles, you may only have to assemble a simple jigsaw puzzle.  In the most difficult puzzles, you will have to figure out how to place chess pieces on a chess board so that none of them cross each others' paths, yet all are able to capture any other piece placed on the chess board.This game is not for young children.  The content is family-friendly, but a great many of the riddles are unsolvable by anyone who's not at least in junior high or even high school.Although many of the puzzles are difficult, you will collect Hint Coins throughout the game.  They are hidden in many different places within the village, such as a garbage can or light pole.  Simply touching an object with the stylus will pop-up a hidden Hint Coin.  You then use these Hint Coins to buy up to 3 hints per riddle.  Note: The first hint is almost always entirely useless.  There are plenty of Hint Coins hidden in the game.  I ended the game with 85 unused Hint Coins.  I found 118 of the 120 puzzles and solved 115 of them.It's an enjoyable game, but remember, you'll be solving the riddles, not the mystery.  The mystery itself is nothing more than a backdrop and excuse to serve up riddle after riddle for the player's enjoyment, addiction, and - sometimes - frustration.
Finding this (along with a GBA game in the same case) at a swap meet at a really competitive price, I'm surprised with how deep Professor Layton's brainteasers go.  The brainchild of psychology professor Akira Tago, the game takes an English gentleman and his eager young assistant to the bizarre village of St. Mystere.  Using the stylus from your DS system, you communicate with the eccentric locals, solve the puzzles and riddles they offer, and poke around the vicinity for hidden puzzles and coins to buy hints.  You're also given a briefcase where you keep clues that'll help in the long run.  As for the puzzles themselves, you don't have to be the Riddler to solve them.  Apart from basic match skills, they test the flexibility and patience of the player; emphasis on patience.  How many of us have thrown our hands up and logged on to YouTube for answers, only to realize we could've gotten it right all along?  Actually, my sole complaint is that the animated cutscenes look much choppier from the demo I played years earlier.  Still, if you're big on brainbusters then Professor Layton and the Curious Village is definitely your cup of tea (See what I did there?).This game is rated E for Everyone.
No matter how the game's cover may look to you, make no mistake that Professor Layton and the Curious Village is one of the best original puzzle games you'll play on the DS yet.  A combination of adventure storytelling and traditional puzzle gaming, Professor Layton never fails to entertain while providing some challenging puzzles.  The game revolves around said Professor Layton traveling to a small village with his young assistant Luke.  Both of whom are on a search for something called The Golden Apple.  To search the town, you move from one area to another by tapping the touch screen, and along the way, you can discover hidden puzzles, hint coins, and secrets, as well as interacting with the townspeople and solving more puzzles.  The game's graphics are incredibly charming, and the FMV sequences are very well done to boot.  The best part about Professor Layton and the Curious Village is that once you do beat the game and unlock the game's 120 plus puzzles, you can download weekly puzzles for absolutely free!  The only real flaw of Professor Layton and the Curious Village is that the game's music is repetitive and even kind of annoying, but you can always turn the volume of the DS down, which you might want to do.  That aside, don't let the box art fool you into thinking that this is a game just for kids.  Professor Layton and the Curious Village is an absolute must own for every puzzle loving DS owner.
As I have been a huge fan of the Professor Layton series ever since The Curious Village came out, naturally I got my hands on this as soon as it came out -- for I expected the pasts of Layton's nemesis Descole (villain of The Last Specter and Miracle Mask) to be revealed as well find out more about the Azran civilization. This game did not disappoint.Story: Professor Layton is invited by renowned archaeologist Professor Sycamore regarding a girl frozen for presumably over 1 million years. Upon their arrival at the frozen cave, the girl is found to be an emissary for an ancient and highly advanced Azran civilization. She requires 5 "keys" to unlock all the wisdom that the Azran left in their legacy. Having Layton and co. resolving mysteries around the world for Azran "keys" was a nice change to the same city setting in the previous games (save Diabolical Box). There are more twists in this than there are in the other games, to the point of using some cliched examples but were nonetheless engaging and astounding (I could never have guessed some of these developments).Gameplay: Per the usual, there are puzzles (150 in the main game) and several minigame puzzles for the player to solve. Upon completion of those, several harder puzzles will be open. Having played through all the Layton games, I found the puzzles in this game to be tougher than the puzzles in the other games. (I also spent more time playing this game than the others). Some puzzles are worded ambiguously but most are very well-done and would provide some challenging fun. There is also the added bonus of Daily Puzzles downloadable via Wi-Fi for an entire year.Visuals & music: Given that this is the last of the games featuring Professor Layton (Level 5 is planning a 7th game though), there are more beautifully animated cut-scenes and a wonderful soundtrack. The music in this game is my favorite in the Layton series.Overall, for fans of puzzles, adventure, and mysteries, this is a game you shouldn't miss. In addition, at the end of this game the opening sequence for The Curious Village ('07-08) is shown, making it clear that the events in this game took place before the first three Layton games released. So I would highly encourage those new to the series to play the Layton games in this order: The Last Specter -> Miracle Mask (3DS)-> Azran Legacy (3DS) -> Curious Village -> Diabolical Box -> Unwound Future.This is really a fitting end to this trilogy, and a sad parting for Professor Layton, even as he continues his adventures in Curious Village and beyond.
I've played some of the other Professor Layton games and was very excited about getting the first title, Curious Village.  I was not disappointed.  The first Professor Layton has the charm, the intracy, and the quality puzzles that I found with the other titles.  The graphics are clear and detailed, I found I very much liked the quaint little village of St. Mystere.  Stopping and solving puzzles as you walk through the story made for hours of entertainment.  My favorite puzzles in this game were a series of Princess in a Box' sliding box puzzles, which progressed from easy to very challenging over the course of the game.  I also liked the 'Rooms at the Inn' minigame, collecting furniture and decorations for the Professor and Luke's rooms, then deciding who should get what.As in all Professor Layton games, it was the detailed layering that intrigued me.  Proceed to a new scene, search for hint coins, stop and read the journal, click on character and solve his puzzle, get new gadgets for the minigames, stop and play a level of minigame, unlock a new bonus content.  So many options and so much to do before you can confidently say you've beat this game.I would recommend this game for all ages.
I loved the game more than Curious Village....and that's saying something!!!  What a great series!  This game has Professor Layton and Luke traveling by train to solve the mystery of the Elysian Box.....which is believed to kill any who open it.* The puzzles are challenging....the music is great....the story line is intriguing.* The mini-games in this one are even better than Curious Village. The hamster maze challenge is my favorite.  There is also a tea challenge. As you go through the game,  different tea ingredients are unlocked.  Some people in the game will want a specific cup of tea (to rejuvenate them, relax them, etc.).  You have to experiment with the tea pot to find the right mix of ingredients to complete the request.  There is also a photo challenge where you are given 2 photographs and you need to try to spot the differences.  Sounds easy....buuuuuttt,  it's not.  Not all of them anyway.* Just as in Curious Village....this game has bonus puzzles that are unlocked as you progress through the game.* Additional weekly puzzles available through Wi-Fi.This game is fantastic!!! A great buy....you won't be disappointed!
I'm playing this game years after the fact because quite frankly, while I don't mind a good puzzle every now and then, it's not my favorite thing to do to pass time.  However Professor Layton's games came highly recommended, so I figured I would at least give it a shot, if nothing else than for the story.There are currently three - soon to be four - Layton games.  Think of Layton as Sherlock Holmes with puzzles.  He experiences different places and events and there is a mystery that needs to be solved underneath.  He gathers information and clues by assisting patrons with puzzles that they cannot solve.  The premise is simple, the back story was quite excellent, and I would submit that if it were not for the deep story, this would be the most average of all games.In Curious Village, Layton is on the hunt for something referred to as the Golden Apple.  He has a treasure map leading him to a mysterious village.  Upon arrival, he is trapped and cannot leave the village, so he decides to go about solving the mystery of the village.  During the stay, there are a number of strange events that lead him to solving his first mystery - patrons that end up missing.I won't spoil the story for you.  But I found the story of Curious Village to be a solid 9 out of 10, hurt only by the presence of certain events that appeared to not be relevant to the story.  The character development was done well, and it wasn't difficult to keep up with the story as it unfolded.  Where the game broke down is the implementation of the puzzles.  The puzzles themselves weren't bad, but the problem is that they were infrequently relevant to the basic story or game.  A lot were just random puzzles thrown in there with no rhyme or reason as to why.I also want to emphasize that a lot of the puzzles were not really puzzles, but actually brain teasers.  Things where the way the question is worded is a trick to the real answer.  For example (not a real puzzle in the game): "John has 26 apples.  He puts 12 of them in the fridge.  He eats one, throws away four, and gives one to his next door neighbor.  Not including the one he ate, how many does John have left?"  Technically, the answer is 24...why?  Because the four he threw away are still in the trash in his house, so technically he still "has" them.  The 12 are still on the table in his house.  The only ones left are the one he ate, which we don't count, and the one that went next door...leaving 24.  Your first instinct is to say that the answer is 8, which would be wrong, or 20, which would also be wrong.  That's an oversimplified example of some of the wordplay that abounds in Curious Village.  Those were the most annoying.  It was never that the puzzles were hard, just annoying.Solving a certain number of puzzles or greater unlocks a lot of secret dealies such as all of the cutscenes (and there are quite a few of these, short though they be).  Beating the game unlocks a code that is used in the second game, which isProfessor Layton and the Diabolical Box.  Because of this last bit, you'll want to start with Curious Village first if you're trying to see if Layton will work for you and you like puzzles that must be solved.  The third game, of course, isProfessor Layton and the Unwound Future.Where Layton stands out is the quick pickup and puzzle solving that used to be an affair for newspaper crossword puzzles.  The presence of a solid story solidifies the game even further.  It is hopeful that the developers see fit to bring over the mashup between Layton and Phoenix Wright, as I can imagine no other more epic combination.
While I enjoyed Professor Layton and the Curious Village, it went by too quickly.The Diabolical Box is like Curious Village but so much better.* This game lasts so much longer that Curious Village, keeps you captivated longer and offers a lot more challenges. Without doing any of the "Bonus" games, this was twice the play time as Curious Village.* The graphics are just as good if not a little better. There are cutaways of movie-like scenes as well as the traditional dialogue scenes, some with voice overs, some without.* The puzzles offer a variety of simple to very challenging. There is a terrific selection of puzzle styles, sure to please all ages.* Hint coins are still readily available with the option of buying up to three hints per puzzle.* Puzzles are everywhere and seem to be just the right mix of puzzle to story/dialogue ratio.* There is a huge improvement to the puzzles with the addition of a MEMO mode. Memo mode allows you to see the puzzle (slightly faded back) and have a scratch pad to make notes or work through the puzzles. This mode holds your notes as you go back and forth from the puzzle to memo again so your notes stay intact.* The storyline is much more enjoyable and the scenery changes often enough (multiple villages, trains, etc.) so you are not traveling back and forth to the same spots over and over.* The introduction of puzzles into the dialogue is a little more natural whereas in Curious Village when you needed to do a puzzle, the character intros to give you the puzzle were much more forced.* The mini games include exercising a hamster (amusing), rebuilding a camera (interesting), brewing tea with different ingredients, as well as the old trunk standbys of a journal, mysteries list, and puzzle index. There is also a 'locked' diary.* The music is fine and doesn't seem to get annoying but the fake English accents are still pretty bad.* The story ends and after credits, allows you to go back to a previous scene to finish playing any puzzles you may have missed.* There is a bonus section that you can get into when starting the game that includes the "Weekly download Puzzle", the puzzle index (the same as in the Professor's Trunk), Layton's Challenges which include some more difficult puzzles that progressively unlock the more you complete. There is also the Top Secret section including character profiles, art, music, and additional sections that unlock with clues found in the game.The only problem I have with a couple of the puzzles is that they are based on noticing details in "photos" and looking at them on a DS screen is difficult since the resolution isn't so hot.I would highly recommend this game for ages 8 and up.
Hello I'm an autistic adult gamer.This is my review on Professor Layton 2/Diabolical Box - DS game.Hi I'm not very good at puzzles & it takes me extremely long time to finish puzzles but I enjoy Professor Layton because of the good storyline.  I also bought the first one Professor Layton/Curious Village a while back & enjoyed it too.  But anyway's I just started on the second one Professor Layton 2/Diabolical Box ds game & am enjoying it just as much as the first one.  Not to give to much away Professor Hershel Layton's mentor is killed at the beginning.  But that's all I'm saying you have to play the rest of the game to see the rest of the storyline unravel it's self.  This is simply a good game.  By the way there making two more Professor layton games after this one for the ds.  They've already released Professor Layton 3/The last Time Travel it can be found on ebay the jap version.  The other one is just now being released over in japan Professor Layton 4/The flute of Malevolent Destiny.Get this game you'll truly enjoy it I know I am.Happy Gaming!
My first Professor Layton game was Unwound Future, so I am backtracking with Diabolical Box.  Not that it makes much difference as all the Prof Layton games can be played on their own and out of order.  I enjoyed this game even more than Unwound Future.  I found the puzzles to be more entertaining and I liked the puzzle progressions with the peg games and chess games.  The characters were more distinct and finely drawn, making for memorable characters such as Sammy Thunder, Babette, and Anton.  I'm however still searching for a reason for the Flora character, and found it disturbing that the gentleman that Professor Layton claims to be did not rush back to Dropstone to rescue her when she was kidnapped, but rather left her locked up in a barn for the duration of the adventure.  Doesn't send the best message to our female gamers.I liked the extras, the tea game, the camera, and the hamster game, although I found the hamster game too easy.  But once complete he sniffed out hint coins for me, so completing the hamster game early was tactically advantageous.I'm still working through all the bonus material but fully intend to buy the remaining Professor Layton games once I've completed this one.  An enjoyable and challenging game, well worth the price.

The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages can be a sequel or a beggining to The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons. In this game Nayru, a sorceress, (you may know her from Zelda: The Ocarina of Time) has been kidnapped by an evil sorceress named Veran. Veran has traveled back in time and you must stop her. In order to go back in time, you need the Harp of Ages. You get some help from some animals, Dimitri the Dodongo, Moosh the winged polar bear, and Ricky the boxing kangaroo.

This is technically part one (or two depending on which order you play) of the Zelda Oracle story.  THe idea in this chapter is simple.  AS Link you are summoned by the triforce to take on an evil force in the land.  In this chapter the oracle of Seasons has beened kidnapped by the Dark Knight Onyx to disrupt the balance of nature and destroy the world.  As link you must assist the elder tree and gather the 8 essences of NAture and rescue the oracle.  Although pretty much unarmed at first you must quest to retrieve these essences and save the day.  After this the story continues in Oracle of Ages where you must eventually take out the true force behind the evil (if you play oracle of ages first than the story goes the other way).What makes this fun though is that the challenge is tremendouse.  A must own for GBC/GBA fans.  Purchase with LoZ Oracle of Ages to get the full story.

This is one of the best games!  You have to play it.  It is definitely the best game in the Zelda series so far.  It has adventure, romance, mystery, and SO many subquests.  It's about a boy named Link who has a destiny.  He lives in Kokiri Village, a little tiny village in the land of Hyrule.  Anyway, a little fairy named Navi comes and says that he must meet the Deku Tree.  He does and the Deku Tree tells him to go inside the Deku Tree and destroy all of the evil monsters inside him.  Link does this and the Deku Tree gives him the Kokiri Emerald, or the Spiritual Stone of Forest.  The Deku Tree phrophesies that Ganondorf, an evil desert Gerudo man, is trying to get hold of the Triforce, the essence of life in Hyrule.  But in order to get hold of the Triforce you have to get three of the spiritual stones.  Unfortuantely, after the tree's prophecy, he died because of the curse Ganondorf had cast upon him.  But Link and Navi go on their journey and get the Goron's Ruby, or Spiritual Stone of Fire and the Zora's Sapphire, or Spiritual Stone of Water.  Link gets the Ocarina of Time but when he opens the doors Ganondorf gets in before him and he gets the Triforce.  Link waits seven years in the Chamber of Time and when he awakes he's all grown up.  Rauru, the Sage of Light is there and tells him that he must save all the Sages from their temples and receive the medallions.  He receives the Medallion of Light, Forest, Fire, Water, Shadow, and Spirit.  But the game.  It's definitely one of the best N64 games around!
Ok I am continuing my reviews for The Zelda games I own cause I don't own every Zelda game. This Zelda game is without a doubt favorite Legend Of Zelda A Link To The Past Which for any of those who don't know was suppose to be called Zelda III The Triforce Saga. But since The NES was near the end of it's life span Nintendo decided to go for The SNES. If any game deserves the title of Zelda III cause I think of the 1st 2 Zelda games on The NES & A Link To The Past as a Triforce Saga. Now after Zelda II wasn't what everybody wanted even though I didn't mind it they decided to go back to an overhead view & drop The RPG elements go back to using Rupee's & weapons instead of using all magic attacks. If I could give this game all the stars in the world I would if I am a fanboy for this game then color me a fanboy. I played this game a lot along with Mario All Stars & Street Fighter II Turbo back in the day. Even now hearing about all the glitches & preforming them this game is feels fresh & this game is 21 years old. This game brings a lot to the table like the tone which would be used in Ocarina Of Time & big time in Majora's Mask as well for Twilight Princess. This game started the dark tone in a Zelda games. You have this character Aghnim he not only collects the money from The King for helping him he then kills The King & takes these Maidens that are ancestors to The Wise Men he seals them into The Dark World. The Dark World is the land where The Triforce is at people who go to The Dark World don't come back & they change shape. It's a twisted version of Hyrule. Link is framed by Aghnim a kid gets sick from the evil air coming from Death Mountain. You have this kid who plays the flute who is dead. The next reviews I do for The Zelda games will go more in depth this game was released in Japan in 1991 & a few months later in The Spring of 92 The name of this game in Japan is The Legend Of Zelda The Triforce Of The Gods. The story is Ganon tries to get his hands on The Triforce he enters The Golden Land The King has 7 Wise Men put a seal on the enterance to The Golden Land which it seems that he's been sealed there forever. Hundreds of years later a drought a famine & illnesses have spread through Hyrule The King thought it had something to do with The Golden Land but the seal was intact a Wizard or a Satanic Priest however you want to look at I prefer what Aghnim was in The Japanese version. Aghnim shows up & ends the problems with Hyrule, The King was looking for decendents of The 7 Wise Men Aghnim helped him find them then he got a big role in The Kingdom Aghnim's intentions came clear he murdered The King Of Hyrule put a mind control spell on The Guards had The Maidens rounded up & sent them to The Dark World which this is all told in the opening & it really showed off the power of The SNES plus that music by Koji Kondo is great which ALTTP is my favorite Zelda score Ocarina Of Time is 2nd the opening music where it shows Aghnim sending The Madiens to The Dark World scared me as a kid.[...]Princess Zelda is locked up she sends out a telepathic message 1 of the people who get it is Link & this is not The same Link from the 1st 2 games & this is not the Zelda you save from the 1st game or the sleeping Zelda from part II. Link's Uncle decides he's going to see what that Aghnim guy is up to he tells Link not to leave the house. Well he does anyway you head for The Castle & find a secret passageway where you find your Uncle has been badly injured he gives you his sword & shield he never finish'e his sentence & there is a lot of debate about what he wants to say he says Princess Zelda is your a lot people say he is going to say your Sister. Link might have a connection to The Royal Family cause in the novel his father was a knight but Zelda being his sister I doubt it. So the 1st thing you have to do is save Zelda & get her to this Church so she can be hid. You have to find 3 Pendants that will allow you to get The Master Sword this game introduces The Master Sword. You'll have a few side quests to get items you need to get to each dungeon or will help you complete it The Light World Dungeon music is another track that scared me as a kid[...]Also Aghnim has framed you for kidnapping Princess Zelda when you get The Master Sword Guards have taken Zelda killed The Priest so you have to head into the area of the castle where you weren't allowed to enter before cause The Master Sword can break the seal. Aghnim makes you watch as he sends Zelda to The Dark World. When you face Aghnim you can't fight him head on you have to play Dead Man's Volley as it's called. When he's beat Aghnim draws you into The Dark World & if you have The Moon Peral from The Tower Of Hera then you won't change shape into a bunny. Going back can be a hassle. This man you meet before the 1st Light World Dungeon Sahasrahla contacts you telepathically & that you have to free all The Maidens & Zelda & that is the only way defeating Aghnim & Ganon. The Dark World has no human's everyone has been turned into a beast or some kind of animal that represents what's in their mind & heart. It might be best to try to upgrade your weapons whenever you can like you shield & you can upgrade The Master Sword when you save this Blacksmith who is trapped in The Dark World. You can get a powerful Golden Sword near the end. The Boomerange can be powered up to reach further when you keep throwing in rupee's to summon a Great Fairy. I like how you can increase the number of arrows & bombs you can carry. The Silver Arrow's return too mainly to defeat Ganon. Other items you need is like from The Desert Temple The Power Glove that allows you to pick up heavy rocks. In the 4th dark world dungeon you get The Titan's Mitt that let's you pick up even heavier rocks & stones. I mentioned you must get The Moon Peral from The Tower Of Hera cause it allows you to keep your human form in The Dark World. Another must have item to even get to the 2nd temple is The Pegasus Boots that Sahasrahla. that let's you move faster & you have to use them to knock The Book Of Madora off a book shelf in Kakariko Village which that book is the only way you can enter The Desert Temple. The 3 Medallions you get are very handy. The items you get in The Dark World such as the hammer in the 1st Dark World dungeon The Hookshot in the 2nd Dark World Dungeon. The Fire Rod in The Forest Temple in The Dark World. The Titan's Mitt mentioned about already in the 4th Dark World dungeon. Then in the 5th Dark World dungeon you get The Blue Mail that reduces the amount of damage you take. The 6th Dark World dungeon contains The Cane Of Somaria that create these blocks that can weigh switches down it can also get create a block that can get you to the other side of the room like in Turtle Rock. Also in Turtle Rock you get The Mirror Shield. In Ganon's Tower you obtain The Red Mail which reduces the amount of damage you take even more. Basically you need all the items to complete the game such as The Ice Rod, Zora Flippers, The Magic Cape, Cane Byrna. There are a couple of side quests that stand out in my mind like the 1 where you get the flute there is this old man & his grandson is missing there is this boy that looks similar to Link & anytime you approach him he disappears it's cause he's dead. In The Dark World you find this animal or whatever it is standing on a tree stump you find out that is Flute Boy cause he went to The Dark World & was killed. With this flute you now have access to a bird that will fly you place to place & this lost old man in the caves leading to Death Mountain & he gives you the mirror that can take you back to The Light World. This game is 1 of the 1st times I believe that Nintendo allowed death in their games. So the game started a dark tone in Zelda games. I mentioned the glitches & how they made this game feels fresh I tried them out there kind of funny like you can face Aghnim while you have Zelda with you & Aghnim is sending Zelda to The Dark World it's like you got Zelda out of her cell so who is Ganon sending to The Dark World. Plus you know it's night time when you start the game & it's raining well if you do the glitch where you beat the game in like 5 minutes then in the ending it's night time & it's still raining. My favorite glitch is where you have the mirror & The Moon Peral ok & you can keep going back & forth from The Light World to The Dark World near the broken bridge & you can explore The Dark World before you even face Aghnim the 1st time. Just make sure you have the mirror, The Moon Peral & The Master Sword. Stuff you have to figure out like how to get The Big Key or the item in each dungeon is great. The bosses were all good The Ball & Chain Trooper who is in the castle. To The Armos Knights which a lot of fun. The boss of The Desert Temple Twinmola it's a good pattern type boss. The Tower Of Hera Moldorm is annoying cause if it knocks you off the ledge then you got to fight the boss all over again. The 1st Aghnim fight is good cause you have to knock it's attacks back at him. The Dark World dungeon bosses are well done some are harder than others such as Arrghus, Mothela, The Blind Thief & Trinexx. The 1st Dark World dungeon boss isn't too hard Helmasaur King you just use your hammer bust away at the metal on his face & fire arrows at the middle of it's head. In The 2nd Dark World Dungeon you battle Arrghus who is a big eyeball surrounded by several small eyes which you have to use The Hookshot to pull the eyes away & slash away with The Master Sword until you have to fight the giant eye. Mothula in The 3rd Dark World Dungeon while difficult all you need is The Fire Rod to beat it. The Blind Thief is hard cause it has 2 or 3 heads attacking you. In The 5th Dark World dungeon you face Kholdstare which is kind of a pain. You also have to have the bird to get to The 6th Dark World dungeon & the boss is Vitreous who is sort of like Arrghus but not as hard. To get into Turtle Rock you have to have The Quake Medallion & to get through it you have to have The Cane Of Somaria. This dungeon is a big pain cause you have to light torches to open some doors & if 1 torch goes out then the door will close. The boss Trinexx in it's 1st phase where you use The Fire & Ice Rod's isn't hard when you fight in it's 2nd phase then it's more of a challenge & I recommend that you get plenty of red or blue potion or some fairies on hand for The Dark World dungeon bosses. When you beat The 7 Dark World dungeon youu free a Maiden & finally Princess Zelda. Which takes you to Ganon's Tower where you fight the 3 Light World dungeon bosses again & have the 2nd & final encounter with Aghnim. Which the 2nd battle with Agahnim is a little bit harder. The final boss is Ganon & Ganon is the hardest of any Zelda game cause it takes 4 Silver Arrow's this time instead of 1 & when stomps the floor the ends start to break off & if you're knocked off the ledge you have to start the battle all over again. I think A Link To The Past Ganon is harder than Ganon in The NES original or Ocarina Of Time. But when you beat Ganon you are treated to a great ending. I know this has been a long read & I said my next reviews for The Zelda games are going to be really long so just a warning. This game is amazing bottom line while love Ocarina Of Time & enjoyed Majora's Mask & Twilight Princess this still remains my favorite Zelda game. If you never played Legend Of Zelda A Ling To The Past you should & play it any way you can cause you will miss out on 1 of the best games of the 90's
Ok I am continuing my reviews for The Zelda games I own cause I don't own every Zelda game. This Zelda game is without a doubt favorite Legend Of Zelda A Link To The Past Which for any of those who don't know was suppose to be called Zelda III The Triforce Saga. But since The NES was near the end of it's life span Nintendo decided to go for The SNES. If any game deserves the title of Zelda III cause I think of the 1st 2 Zelda games on The NES & A Link To The Past as a Triforce Saga. Now after Zelda II wasn't what everybody wanted even though I didn't mind it they decided to go back to an overhead view & drop The RPG elements go back to using Rupee's & weapons instead of using all magic attacks. If I could give this game all the stars in the world I would if I am a fanboy for this game then color me a fanboy. I played this game a lot along with Mario All Stars & Street Fighter II Turbo back in the day. Even now hearing about all the glitches & preforming them this game is feels fresh & this game is 21 years old. This game brings a lot to the table like the tone which would be used in Ocarina Of Time & big time in Majora's Mask as well for Twilight Princess. This game started the dark tone in a Zelda games. You have this character Aghnim he not only collects the money from The King for helping him he then kills The King & takes these Maidens that are ancestors to The Wise Men he seals them into The Dark World. The Dark World is the land where The Triforce is at people who go to The Dark World don't come back & they change shape. It's a twisted version of Hyrule. Link is framed by Aghnim a kid gets sick from the evil air coming from Death Mountain. You have this kid who plays the flute who is dead. The next reviews I do for The Zelda games will go more in depth this game was released in Japan in 1991 & a few months later in The Spring of 92 The name of this game in Japan is The Legend Of Zelda The Triforce Of The Gods. The story is Ganon tries to get his hands on The Triforce he enters The Golden Land The King has 7 Wise Men put a seal on the enterance to The Golden Land which it seems that he's been sealed there forever. Hundreds of years later a drought a famine & illnesses have spread through Hyrule The King thought it had something to do with The Golden Land but the seal was intact a Wizard or a Satanic Priest however you want to look at I prefer what Aghnim was in The Japanese version. Aghnim shows up & ends the problems with Hyrule, The King was looking for decendents of The 7 Wise Men Aghnim helped him find them then he got a big role in The Kingdom Aghnim's intentions came clear he murdered The King Of Hyrule put a mind control spell on The Guards had The Maidens rounded up & sent them to The Dark World which this is all told in the opening & it really showed off the power of The SNES plus that music by Koji Kondo is great which ALTTP is my favorite Zelda score Ocarina Of Time is 2nd the opening music where it shows Aghnim sending The Madiens to The Dark World scared me as a kid.[...]Princess Zelda is locked up she sends out a telepathic message 1 of the people who get it is Link & this is not The same Link from the 1st 2 games & this is not the Zelda you save from the 1st game or the sleeping Zelda from part II. Link's Uncle decides he's going to see what that Aghnim guy is up to he tells Link not to leave the house. Well he does anyway you head for The Castle & find a secret passageway where you find your Uncle has been badly injured he gives you his sword & shield he never finish'e his sentence & there is a lot of debate about what he wants to say he says Princess Zelda is your a lot people say he is going to say your Sister. Link might have a connection to The Royal Family cause in the novel his father was a knight but Zelda being his sister I doubt it. So the 1st thing you have to do is save Zelda & get her to this Church so she can be hid. You have to find 3 Pendants that will allow you to get The Master Sword this game introduces The Master Sword. You'll have a few side quests to get items you need to get to each dungeon or will help you complete it The Light World Dungeon music is another track that scared me as a kid[...]Also Aghnim has framed you for kidnapping Princess Zelda when you get The Master Sword Guards have taken Zelda killed The Priest so you have to head into the area of the castle where you weren't allowed to enter before cause The Master Sword can break the seal. Aghnim makes you watch as he sends Zelda to The Dark World. When you face Aghnim you can't fight him head on you have to play Dead Man's Volley as it's called. When he's beat Aghnim draws you into The Dark World & if you have The Moon Peral from The Tower Of Hera then you won't change shape into a bunny. Going back can be a hassle. This man you meet before the 1st Light World Dungeon Sahasrahla contacts you telepathically & that you have to free all The Maidens & Zelda & that is the only way defeating Aghnim & Ganon. The Dark World has no human's everyone has been turned into a beast or some kind of animal that represents what's in their mind & heart. It might be best to try to upgrade your weapons whenever you can like you shield & you can upgrade The Master Sword when you save this Blacksmith who is trapped in The Dark World. You can get a powerful Golden Sword near the end. The Boomerange can be powered up to reach further when you keep throwing in rupee's to summon a Great Fairy. I like how you can increase the number of arrows & bombs you can carry. The Silver Arrow's return too mainly to defeat Ganon. Other items you need is like from The Desert Temple The Power Glove that allows you to pick up heavy rocks. In the 4th dark world dungeon you get The Titan's Mitt that let's you pick up even heavier rocks & stones. I mentioned you must get The Moon Peral from The Tower Of Hera cause it allows you to keep your human form in The Dark World. Another must have item to even get to the 2nd temple is The Pegasus Boots that Sahasrahla. that let's you move faster & you have to use them to knock The Book Of Madora off a book shelf in Kakariko Village which that book is the only way you can enter The Desert Temple. The 3 Medallions you get are very handy. The items you get in The Dark World such as the hammer in the 1st Dark World dungeon The Hookshot in the 2nd Dark World Dungeon. The Fire Rod in The Forest Temple in The Dark World. The Titan's Mitt mentioned about already in the 4th Dark World dungeon. Then in the 5th Dark World dungeon you get The Blue Mail that reduces the amount of damage you take. The 6th Dark World dungeon contains The Cane Of Somaria that create these blocks that can weigh switches down it can also get create a block that can get you to the other side of the room like in Turtle Rock. Also in Turtle Rock you get The Mirror Shield. In Ganon's Tower you obtain The Red Mail which reduces the amount of damage you take even more. Basically you need all the items to complete the game such as The Ice Rod, Zora Flippers, The Magic Cape, Cane Byrna. There are a couple of side quests that stand out in my mind like the 1 where you get the flute there is this old man & his grandson is missing there is this boy that looks similar to Link & anytime you approach him he disappears it's cause he's dead. In The Dark World you find this animal or whatever it is standing on a tree stump you find out that is Flute Boy cause he went to The Dark World & was killed. With this flute you now have access to a bird that will fly you place to place & this lost old man in the caves leading to Death Mountain & he gives you the mirror that can take you back to The Light World. This game is 1 of the 1st times I believe that Nintendo allowed death in their games. So the game started a dark tone in Zelda games.

Look to the center of the console adventure gaming galaxy, and there you will find Link. Every heart piece you've ever collected and gem you've gathered, every block you've pushed and wall you've bombed open, every Dark World you've visited and 3D sword-lock you've acquired-all these things stem from Shigeru Miyamoto's incremental innovations in arranging adventure game 1s and 0s. This time, however, our Hero's had an inspiration of a different sort. Few things in this life have gotten gamers as riled up as the Great Kiddifying of Young Master Link; chances are you'd already convinced yourself whether you love Cel-da or hate him before you'd even played the game. For the cel-haters, no amount of gushing is gonna change your mind-even if you heard that the quality of the liquid watercolor animation rivals (heck, surpasses) Disney's best, or that the game's spirit taps into the same natural-mystical kid/adult crossover zone occupied by the finest films of Hayao Miyazaki (Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke). For the cel-lover, The Wind Waker will be the adventure of a lifetime...a combination of vivid artistry and timeless gameplay that radiates magic shiny happy life light. Miyamoto's goal has always been to make sure that everything that goes into his games only serves to make them more fun...features lists and demographic data be damned. In that regard, The Wind Waker doesn't stray from the winning formula that's made the series such a smashing success. The Overworld still holds more secrets than you'll ever find. Dungeons contain the standard assortment of maps, new tools, and boss battles. Even Link's new baton is essentially a dressed-up version of the Ocarina of Time as you learn various songs to open doors, transport across the map, and change night into day. There are still blocks to push and chests to open-though all of this is handled with a bit more wisdom and a bit more refinement. The game features fewer "dungeons" in the traditional sense, but the ones that are here tend to be huger and more challenging with new twists (several of the more ingenious ones have you leading around another character, Ico-style, to solve puzzles). Later in the game, the notion of "dungeons" is all but overthrown by a series of wonderfully elaborate treasure hunts that are sure to tax even the most accomplished Zelda gamer.The biggest (non-Celda-related) change comes in the way the Overworld is presented: as a vast ocean, set in a 7x7 grid, each square containing an island with something to find-a heart container piece or rupee stash at the least, an entire bird-person city or multi-level dungeon at the most. Each island is surrounded by tons of other stuff to tax your to-do list: some magic fish to find, some unexpected mini racecourse to traverse, some shark to kill, some random treasure trove to yank up from the brine. In many ways, the structure resembles Westwood's underappreciated Pirates: The Legend of Black Kat. While trekking between islands threatens to become tedious, there's always a million somethings to do on the way if you're so inclined-treasure maps to decipher, giant squids to encounter, submarines to pilfer, Great Fairies to free. Even so, the game's surprisingly non-linear, exploration-nurturing nature often requires patience and sturdy sea legs for backtracking. Combat is a supreme joy-it incorporates Ocarina's lock-on system, though new additions like countering and disarming are a cause for celebration (combos create awesome Looney Tunes-y "dynamic soundtracks"), and experimenting on foes with your newly acquired tools generates lots of happy fun hormone. You'll rarely die, and while the boss battles are glorious, they're not exactly tough. More fun/less frustrating is the game's fighting philosophy. Unfortunately, the camera can really freak out on you, and you'll often find yourself in first-person mode when you meant to be locked on. Where things get truly challenging is in the puzzles: For most of the game, the fun-to-frustration ratio is pitch perfect, but be warned that you will get stuck as the Wind Waker has a knack for turning the most mundane box-pushing puzzle into a test for a Mensa membership. Take, for example, the Earth Dungeon, which does for "reflecting light" what Ocarina of Time did for "changing water levels." All this, of course, is stitched together by one of the most creative and beautiful worlds ever conceived and brought to life...not just in video gaming, but in the whole realm of animation, film, and art. While The Wind Waker may be a bit too complex for the young, it's definitely made for the young at heart. The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker dares to defy the notion that games need to be more "gritty and realistic" by choosing instead to become exactly the opposite. Link's is an adventure as old as time, but it feels like the most refreshing game in the world thanks to creative daring, insanely superior production values, and-above all-gameplay that would be fun even if Link were five colors, 16 pixels, and carried a blue monochrome block for a sword

Every instalment in the long-running Zelda series is as sharp as Link's sword but Twilight Princess is an absolute masterpiece.This latest epic quest features a compelling, darker plot and many memorable characters. Players control a grown-up Link, exploring Hyrule on foot, on horseback or as a powerful wolf.Link is transformed into the beast when entering the mysterious Twilight realm, complete with heightened senses and brute strength. The wolf sections are cleverly integrated into the game, and in latter stages players can transform at will, allowing clever puzzles.Link's enigmatic, fascinating companion Midna is another brilliant addition, providing helpful assistance and playing a key role in the story, in which Hyrule is consumed by a world of shadows and inhabitants turned to ghosts.Some gamers were concerned that lengthy sessions with the motion-sensing remote would be too tiring but the controls quickly become second nature and do not require much exertion. Sword swinging works well even though it doesn't require finesse and pointing at targets when unleashing arrows or hurling boomerangs is a terrific addition. Battling enemies from horseback is particularly thrilling.As usual, most time is spent in carefully constructed dungeons such as forest, water, sky and fire temples. Each features many ingenious puzzles and secrets and concludes with a battle against a memorably massive, fearsome boss.At more than 40 spellbinding hours, this is the largest Zelda yet and features an almost overwhelming amount of content. Diversions such as fishing, mini-games, collection duties and side quests are extremely engaging time-wasters. The game could be criticised for not radically altering the Zelda template but when the formula is based on some of the best games made (Ocarina of Time and A Link to the Past) it seems churlish to complain. Link's legions of fans would not have it any other way.ENDGAME: Imaginative and masterfully designed, Twilight Princess is every bit as good as the best Zelda adventures. It is hugely rewarding and absolutely essential for new Wii owners.

This game boy comes with a built in lightwith a light switch,well thats good news,but The Game Boy Advance SP is a lott smaller then the standard Game Boy Advance and can fold up like a tinylaptop computer when not being played.And it doesnt use any standard batteries,the Game Boy Advance SP needs to charge like a regular cell phone with an AC adapter.A Lithium ion battery is built in and cannot be removed or replaced.Nintendo claims that with 3 hours of charging equals 10 hours of play or 18 if you dont use the light.but the AC adapter can be used as a regular power source so you can play the Game Boy  Advance SP can be played while plugged into the wall.

You can also link other GB Advance units to the GB Player for multiplayer games using the External Extension Connector available, and you can normally use the e-Reader accesory as well.When you turn on the GameCube with the GB Player and a cartridge game inserted on the GB Player (not the GB Advance), you'll see the game's startup screen as you will normally do with your GB Advance console, this time the display is transferred to the larger TV screen and surrounded by a graphical frame.The games simply look wonderful, sharp and colorful.  All the details that you simply miss in the limited GB Advance display screen are shown here on the big TV screen.  I was expecting blocky, low-resolution graphics, but I was really surprised at the sharpness these Advance games have, even on larger screens.You can play with a GameCube controller or use the GB Advance as a controller (provided that you have a GC/GB Advance cable).  The Z button on the GC controller opens up the GB Player special options.Special Options include:- Frame Settings: There are 20 different and colorful frames to choose from- Screen Size - You can have Full Size screen or Normal Viewing (a larger frame borders your game)- Controller - This option tells the GB Player your button location preferences to take advantage of the additional buttons that the GC controller provides- Screen Filter - This option adjusts image quality- Timer - You can set a time reminder with a sound and a message on screen (&quot;Time's up kiddo, dinner's ready&quot;)- Change Game Pak - You are allowed to &quot;hot-swap&quot; your game paks, meaning that you do not need to turn off the power to switch games.This was a great addition to my gaming &quot;kingdom&quot;, I definitely recommend it.
I purchased this accesory more out of curiosity than anything else; the price was not bad so I took the chance and I do not regret it.The GameBoy Player (GB Player) accesory is connected to the High Speed port below your GameCube console (GC), it has two tiny screws to tighten it to your console and avoid accidental drops.  An ejector button is also provided, to allow for proper removal.

Gameboy Advance SP solves the problems that the original Gameboy Advance had.  Namely, it provides a backlight that makes the system usable in any lighting conditions.  The older version, while a technological marvel when it came to the handheld gaming platform was hampered by the lack of a backlight, the dark shadings of most of its games, and the truly atrocious external lighting accessories that could be purchased for the system.  The SP version's backlight eliminates those problems while also improving on the rest of the system.  The SP is more compact than the original advance, making it more portable.  It also has a foldover design that enables the screen to be protected when not in use, thereby avoiding the scratches the original system was susceptible to.  Finally, the system, itself, requires no batteries.  It's power source is internal and only requires a charging after about 12 of continous play.The only drawback in this system is the lack of a jack for earphones, but that is a minor, minor flaw.  This system can still play every Gameboy game every created (back to the original 15-year old system) and has a wealth of tremdenous titles at its disposal (like the Metroid series and numerous older games that get ported for the handheld platform).  Don't be put off by the SP's 3 1/2 star average rating.  Many of the negative reviewers are people who dislike Nintendo in general.  Objectively, the quality of the SP is tremendous and the titles at its disposal are incredible.

The Game Boy Advance SP is the latest new hardware from Nintendo. This portable gaming system has the exact same inside parts as the original GBA, it is simply redesigned to fit the GBA SP's more compact shape. This reincarnation of the Game Boy was developed to help Nintendo capture the audience of older gamers and also to better compete with the new cell phones that have games on them. The letters "SP" in the name stand for "special."The GBA SP is noticeably smaller than its predecessor. It is just over 3x3 inches wide, and about 1 inch thick. It is made up of two hinged panels, with the top part being the screen and the bottom part being the standard buttons (the design is similiar to a laptop computer--only smaller). The LCD screen part does not hinge or snap shut, but it is sturdy and does not shake or move when you are playing. The LCD screen is the same size as the original GBA's. The cartridge goes in on the bottom part of the front of the unit. The L and R buttons are still there, but smaller and are located on the back edge behind the other buttons.The GBA SP comes in the colors platinum and cobalt (metallic blue).The GBA SP is compatible with almost all existing Game Boy games (including GB Pocket, GB Color, GBA, etc.). Unfortunately, because of the way the game cartridge is inserted upside-down, tilt-sensor games, such as Kirby's Tilt-n-Tumble, will not function properly on the GBA SP. However, rumble games, such as Pokemon Pinball, do indeed work.Also, all existing accessories will work for this product, including the Card-e reader, the Gamecube link cable, and AC adapters. Instead of two AA batteries, the system uses its own built in lithium-ion battery which Nintendo claims will last 18 hours (10 hours with the light on).Yes, that's right! The GBA SP has a light on it, which may be the best reason to upgrade. The LCD part of the unit is lighted, allowing you to finally play in low or no light! The screen is lit evenly from all sides, making it look even better than a GBA with an Afterburner installed. The light turns on and off with a button above the controls.The specs are the same as the GBA, but in case you don't know them, here are the basic ones:-32-bit processor w/embedded memory-display approx. 41x61 mm-resolution 240x160 pixels-over 32,000 colors displayed simulaneouslyIn conclusion, I would highly recommend this product, especially if you do not own a Game Boy Advance. This product is targeted at new older-aged gamers, but even if you own a GBA, the [money] might not be a big price to pay for the cool new design, smaller size, and lighted screen.

If you own a GameCube, I hope you enjoy the ergonomic design of the controllers as much as I do.  When Nintendo announced it was releasing a first party wireless controller I was very excited.  This controller doesn't disappoint, with the same button and stick layouts as the wired first-party controllers.You choose a frequency to use (by rotating a numbered dial on both the controller and the receiver that plugs into the controller port on the Cube), which allows you to use up to 4 Wavebirds at a time (should an aggressive Super Smash Bros Melee match be in your future).The controller also has an on/off switch, which allows you to shut it off and save extra battery life, which is a nice touch. I also appreciate the red light on the receiver, which lights up when it receives the signal from the Wavebird (making it very easy to tell if you are in range).The only complaint that I have is one that Nintendo has addressed, namely the lack of Rumble functionality.  To paraphrase Nintendo, to add the rumble feature would have greatly shortened the battery life of the controller.  For many games, the lack of rumble feature isn't an issue, and the WaveBird works perfectly.  For those games that rumble is a major part of, I just use an extension cable for my wired controller.  ;)

This is one deep game.Included are ground troops, naval units, and air units.Each has their own sub catagories:Ground: melee (infantry, tanks, anti-air machine guns) and indirect (rocket launchers, artillary, anti-air ranged attackers)Naval: subs, cruisers, and battleships (your resident indirect unit)Air: copters(transport, fair attacker) and planes (fighters, bombers)Each has specifics as to what they are effective against.  For example, the fighter jets can only attack other air units, but they do so almost unconditionally effectively.  The player must worry about fuel consumption for each unit, many consume different amounts, like air units use 5 per day, terrain effects in addition to unit-attack compatability, CO powers, which can unfairly turn the battle in your opponents favor, and base capture, which is usually the main goal of campaigns.This only scratches the surface of this game's depth.  Included is a very lengthy campaign, numerous individual maps that begin you with no units and require speed, efficiency, and power to take the enemy's main base, and a 3-hour tutorial on the game's basics.Recommended to all who have a craving for intense, turn-based strategy on the almost-already-venerable Gameboy Advance.

his game is one of those games that you will keep playing until the next line of consoles come out. This game is hectic one player and even more hectic if you bring friends over. There is the engine size like in all MK games (50cc, 100cc, 150cc, etc.) the higher the CC the faster you go and the harder the AI is. after choosing your cc you get to choose your characters and your kart. You get two characters per kart each charaacter with a special item (baby mario gets chain chomp, DK gets big banana, etc.). after choosing your characters from the list of 16+ you choose your kart. The karts are sorted by weight class (light, medium, heavy). your characters determine what weight class you are in, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. after that you choose between 4 cups (mushroom, flower, star, and special) each with 4 tracks in them. by getting golds in the cups you unlock new content like extra battle tracks and characters.speaking of battle this is one of the best parts. get your friends together and blow them up in one of three battle types (shine thief, bob-omb blast, and classic balloon battle). in shine thief you want to take control of the shine until the timer reaches zero, get the shine by hitting them with shells, banana peel, or whatever else. in bob-omb blast every question mark block is a bomb and you blow each other up first to 3 or 4 hits wins. In balloon battle you have three balloons and the last one with any balloons wins. Knock your friends out by shooting them with shells to make their balloons fly away.All in all i think this game is one of the best on the gamecube and i recomend it to all gamecube owners.

Ive been playing this game for years by myself and with my friends. It is simply amazing. For single player there are 3 different grand prixs each with 4 wacky courses with 3 levels, 50cc,100cc, and 150cc. Higher the cc the higher the speed. Each level up is harder. Beat levels to unlock the special cup, special karts, and new amazing characters. Each character has its own special like marios flame balls and koopas triple red shells. There are tons of multiplayer options for up to 4 players. Race each other in a grand prix, go one on one or whatever combination in a versus. Or face off 2 on 2. For two players, there is a co-op mode. One person drives, while the other rides shotgun being able to throw items and punch nearby opponents karts. There is also a battle mode for up to 4 players with weird tracks such as tilt-a-kart and pipe plaza. There are 3 battles, Shine theif, bob-omb blast, and balloon battle. All of them are loads of fun, especially bob-omb blast and balloon battle. Unlock another level known as mirror and play each course reverse. Unlock the all-cup-tour and play a 16 race tour following every single race.  Here are my final totals:Fun: 9/10, nothing like throwing items and duking it out to the finishmultiplayer/co-op: 10/10, tons of fun options for up to 4 playerstime: 10/10, hours upon hours of gameplaybugs: nonefeatures: 10/10, several unlockable features and race coursesoverall: 10/10, a legendary game. One of the few bright spots in the gamecube library.

This game is great. You can either duel it out with up to 3 of you're freinds(plus you) or do a single player campaign. Let me explain single player campaign first. A deadly virus kills 99% of women in the game and so the National Guard takes the reamaining women to a Quarantine Zone. In the game,you are Griffin Spade and you must rescue Madison from the Federal Relocation Forces(earlier reffered to as the National Guard). To progress in the game,you must destroy enemy tanks and bunkers,destroy enemy bases prior to rescueing the queenlords inside them(the last base is the Quarantine Zone in Snfrinsisco),take the queenlords to you're base via you're tank,earn new types of Tanks as you progress(Goliath,M1A1,and a minature one),gain ally tanks by earning points(note:you can't get ally tanks until after rescueing the first qeenlord),and gain Power Ups which provide you're tank with sheilds,replacement armor(if you're tank gets damaged),weapons,and ammo. The capaign mode is really fun and has good replay value(considering you can get more tanks if you get more points than you did lst time),but it's still good to do multiplayer modes with freinds for both practice(to prepair for campaign mode) and fresh challenges(if you've beat campaign mode more than once). Plus campaign mode includes bonus rounds where you can earn extra points. Okay here's a list of all the multiplayer modes:Deathmatch:You must be on you're own against other players for this one,but you can get automatick gun terrets to assist you.Annilation:Depending on the gang you choose,you get a certain number of Goliaths,minature tanks(similar in size to gun terrets,and of course,M1A1's.  Battlord:Simply steal enemy queenlords.  Strategy is greatly involved as they're are 3+ ways to get past a enemy Goliath tank(fire guided missiles from your own base,move in and out fast with a moto tank,head on attack,lay mines on its track,or place a neough gun buddies to take it down.  Defense measures include protecting your goliath tank,laying mine around your base,switching to goliath tank,or placing gun buddies.
Instead of blabbing on about how much I love this game I'm going to list the awesome features of this game.~Weaponry~ There are 45 new weapons,  and even (when completing all the weapons training with gold medals on each  weapon) some of the old Geoldeneye weapons (cool huh?)  ~Here's a list  of the pistols available in the game~ Falcon2: Similiar to the trusty  Walther PPK (the PP7) from Goldeneye, this is your average weapon,  avaliable on almost every single level. It's accurate (it has a laser sight  for even more accuracy), it's got a quick reload (about 1.8 seconds), an  eight round clip, and quick fire. (Although I don't get why for stealthy  missions they give you a shiny gun)Falcon2 (silenced): (See above) same  as the Falcon2 but with a silencer for even more stealth.Falcon2  (scope): (See Falcon2) same as the Falcon2 listed above, but with a scope  to hit distant targets, great for a distant kill with the power of the  Falcon2 pistol.MagSec4: The MagSec4 is not a grand weapon and is only  available once on Single Player but it's certainly not a bad gun and is  terribly deadly when paired. It's not extremely accurate, but it fires fast  and loads quick, just like the Falcon2.Mauler: The Mauler is one of  (maybe the best) pistol(s) in the game. It not only has a huge clip (20  rounds!), but it also fires quick and loads almost as fast. It's secondary  mode (yes! guns have secondary modes just hold B!) is a charged up shot.  You just let the ammo go down by 5 (from 20 to 15 for example) then fire,  your opponent will be killed in one shot! Very convenient!Phoenix: This  is a Maian (the 'grey' alien race) pistol, that fires out quick laser-like  shots, and it's secondary mode (great from a distance) fires out large  fiery shells, that do great damage to an opponent.DY357 Magnum: Similar  to the old Cougar Magnum from Goldeneye, but much better. It has great  range and absolutely no scatter damage! It can even shoot through doors. A  great all-around weapon.DY357 LX Magnum: This gun is not available in  Single Player, but it is the weapon of choice of the fictional NRA head  Trent Easton. Very similar to the DY537 standard issue magnum in looks but  it can kill in only one shot.Those were some examples of the weaponry,  now on to the Multiplayer!~Multiplayer~ There are 30 new Multiplayer  challenges! Plus the addition of simulants (computer controlled enemies)  and 16 new Multiplayer levels! Along with six Multiplayer  settings.Challenges: These are mulitplayer challenges that can be played  with one or four players, and has rules for each match, which when  completed may unlock a new setting, or weapon, or level which is then  available in Multiplayer!Levels: 13 totally new and original multiplayer  levels, along with three modified levels from Goldeneye which are now as  fun as ever: Facility (now dubbed 'Felicity' for copyright reasons),  Complex, and Temple (which now actually looks like a Temple). Not all of  the new levels are great, but some are better for different settings then  others, although some of them are pretty bad, the majority are good  though.Characters: Tons of characters are now available (although the  face mapping feature was taken our probably because of the Columbine  shooting) which can be gained by defeating a Multiplayer challenge. You can  also switch heads and put them on different bodies!Simulants: There are  now simulants you can fight in Multiplayer, on different settings: Meat Sim  (self explanatory), Easy Sim(comparable to an amateur), Normal Sim  (combarable to an average human player), Hard Sim (comparable to a very  good human player), Perfect Sim (self explanatory), Dark Sim (Created by  the fictitious Data Dyne corporation this Sim is almost impossible to  defeat!). The Sims can also be set to 13 different  characteristics!~Single player~The game is now seperated into 9  missions with seventeen levels plus three extra levels (available when  defeating the game on different settings) and one bizarre shooting level  called &quot;The Duel&quot;The levels are split very well, and some can  be more fun then others. Some will seem like a tedious chore when playing  although the majority of others are a blast!More Multiplayer! You can  also play the game (single player missions) against a friend! Yes, it's  true. You're friend plays as an enemy, and when killed re-spawns as another  enemy opponent, until the level is completed or until Joanna Dark is dead.The game can also be played with a computerized ally, your first choice  is Velvet Dark (Joanna's sister) but more are available when the game is  defeated on a different setting.Another cool option is how you can walk  around your headquarters, the Carrington institute. Here, you can talk to  your boss, Daniel Carrington (although not much!) and you can learn how to  fist fight, be more accurate with each weapon, learn about other characters  and ships, and learn how to use cool gadgets like the CamSpy (a hovering  little camera, that is controlled by you by just moving it around with the  joy stick).Some good features: The game is clearly aimed for a mature  audience, although it has both a paintball mode to filter out the blood,  and a language filter, to keep out all that bloody swearing.My only  grudge with the games are the casts 'American' accents. Although the  voice-over cast tried to put on their best American Voices, you can still  hear hints of British accents in there, but who really cares?P.S. Be  aware of the dreaded voice of the head hacker in hacker central, and listen  to how the President pronounces 'assume.'

This is a very fun, somewhat addictive game. It offers several different breeds and the ability to enter a frisbee contest, agility trails, and obedience contests. You can take your dogs for walks and find various items to sell, wear, or play with. You can go to the park while on a walk to meet other dogs or practice for the frisbee contest, you can visit the agility training area, or the discount store for great deals and sometimes items that are only available there. If you have a friend that owns a Nintendogs game, you can enter bark mode, and give each other gifts or just visit each other. There are many toys, accessories, and various miscellaneous items as well. All in all a great game for anyone that loves dogs.
Animal Crossing is a story about a HUMAN in a world DOMINATED by the Animal Species i think. Well your character is living on his own. You start out on a train you adjust the date time and city name and all that good stuff and by that you get a different map ach time you start over. When you get there you dont have enough money to by a house so you have to work all it off by working for tom nook the LOSER Racoon. Once your done working you have to pay of the house rent if you want a bigger house you end up having to sell all the crap you dont need, and then at the end you get a two stroy house live there a year, but literally playing every day of the year 365 or 366. The graphics arent State of the art but the animals you meet in your neighborhood are fun and DIFFERENT. You can even celerbrate special hoildays and envents in your neighbor hood it is a great game no real negatives beside the graphics. There so much stuff to do in the Animal Crossing world. I give it 5 stars. A great Mintendo Story

If you love animals/Anthros, Real-life simulators, and Customization, then Animal Crossing is for you, Get a life- literally!, wear clothing, Furnish your house, Be friends (or mortal foes) with the neighbors (which are all animals, your basically the only human), and slave away for a cheap raccoon that gives you a house bill of $14,000 at the start of the game, I know right? but when you pay that off you can extend your house....anyway, you can also fish, catch bugs, plant flowers/Trees, and loads more-- By the way, this game was originally released in japan on the Nintendo 64, but was ported to the USA on Gamecube.

I just love this game. I started with getting animal crossing: wild world for the DS. So I needed the GC version. There are SO many things to do in animal crossing!!! First, they let you pick a name, a gender, and you even get to name the town that you're heading to! The town is full of trees, green, and 3D! Other animals will also live their life in the town with houses that you may enter. You can talk to the animals who have unique names, and even personalitys! There are over a hundred things these animals can say to you, so it NEVER gets boring! You get your own house, too! You can upgrade your house (But it's very expensive...:?), and put items (furniture, chairs statues, wardrobes, beds, desks, lamps, NES games [which you can play, there are 15 at all, not special ones like super mario bros. and the legend of zelda, actually these can be obtained with action replay, NOT recomended, but you CAN get games like "balloon fight" or "donkey kong"], special items like 8-bit mario sprites, etc.) in it, too! You can even put in wallpaper and floorings! They are numerous ways to get these items like an item store (the best way), animals, etc! There will also be a tailor, where you can design your own works of art on a canvas (which actually kind of reminds me of MS paint XD) and then display them (other animals can come in and get your design too, no joke!), store them, or keep them! What you do with designs is put them as your clothes or umbrella. Also, tom nook (the owner of the item shop) owns clothes and umbrellas that you buy, but you can display these in your house! There are also special town events that take place such as "the fishing owurney" or "toy day". This game never gets old, and asspcially not boring! Also, it's cute, midgety, and chibi! Whether you'rea boy, a girl, a man, or a woman, you'll LOVE this heke of a game!

Ah, Nintendo. Always willing to take a risk on a non-violent game. Of course, this does follow the same mold of previous popular non-violent games such as Harvest Moon and The Sims. But Nintendo doesn't delve into the sexual (however mild) relationships of those two games. It's not about wooing and winning your love, hopping in bed for a little Woo-hoo!, and creating a life for your character. This game's about fishing, catching bugs, collecting furniture, doing jobs for the neighbors, and paying off the mortgage on your house. The most violent thing in it is whacking your neighbors over the head with the bug net, and the only sexuality involves the questionable shape of the gyroid machines.The Good:+ Addictive+ A colorful cast of characters+ Tons to collect and customizeThe Bad:-- The lack of goals may turn some gamers away-- The charm wears off eventuallyThe Ugly::( Just what is your character supposed to be?Gameplay--8/10The purpose of this game is to just live in the game's town and interact with everyone and everything. Paying off your house's mortgage to shopkeeper Tom Nook is the only real goal, but you can work it at your own pace. It's a little ironic that to get the money to pay off the mortgage, you have to sell stuff to Tom Nook. He's basically paying it off for you, with only miniscule effort on your part. Of course, paying it off has its rewards: a larger house. The first time you pay off the mortgage, your house size increases twofold, but then you have a new payment to make. Make that, and you get a basement, and so on.There are plenty of things to do, so many that it's difficult to mention them all without just listing them. I'll mention a few, since part of the fun is figuring out everything for yourself, anyway. The three obvious things are those connected with the museum, where you can donate fossils, bugs, and fish. Fossil finding is nothing more than luck. You find a patch of grass marked with an "X," dig it up, and send your findings in the mail for it to be identified. Catching insects and fish is much more fun and rewarding. They appear in different types of weather and different seasons of the year. Thus, insects are scarce in the winter time. And different fish appear in the sea water than in the fresh water. There's a much greater variety of fresh water fish, though the sea has the largest and rarest of the fishes. Catching the coelacanth is great. Catching it again is even better. The first time it can go to the museum, and the second it can go in your basement. Of everything you can do in the game, I spent the most fishing.Unfortunately, it gets a little boring in this blissful, peaceful town. There's not much to do other than what I've listed. You can kick a ball around, build a snowman, or accessorize your wardrobe, but when things get boring, there's nothing to get you past that point of boredom. Other games might grow boring until you get past a certain point, but Animal Crossing doesn't have that luxury. Once it's boring, that's it. And if you neglect your town long enough, it will become overrun by weeds because, apparently, you're the only citizen who cares enough to keep it cleaned up. If you ever have an urge to come back to it after giving it a break, the weeds ruin your welcome back. As the rest of the neighbors live in their blissful ignorance, you'll be left to pull out weeds one by one. Pretty soon you'll just give up.Longevity--10/10Despite the above-mentioned boredom, the game will suck up lots of your time before you set it aside for good. That you can share your town with other players is a plus, and it makes letter writing much more fun. Since it is a game you can't complete, it technically has an infinite life span. Some people will quit after a couple of hours, most will quit after fifty, and many will continue to wipe the dust off their Gamecube, plug this game in, and play for many, many more hours.

I remember playing this game growinhgup  when I was inbetween the age of 5 and 13 I rented this for about a week. I only got to the Pirahnha Plnat boss. I though along with Super Metrioid in was on of the harder Super Nintendo games to master. If you were a novice at mario like I was. Here are  boss statics and startegies froma speed run on you tube recently posted. This was done use tool assitance like slowly the game speed down and like saving possibly more frequentylu than normal. The real game may take you longer or more than about 103 minutes or less to complete excluding the credits. But here are some startegties for most of the boss battles. I may have left out one battle before  baby Boswer when you might have to fight the evil Kopa Magican that kidnapped bady Lugi and  appears in ever boss stage making the enemies bigger most of the time. IF you don't want this assitance than close the website and find out on your own I only have about 9 minutes until my class. Yoshi Island Sattics. first boss enlarge has 1/6  damage resitance against egg shot attaacks.Next boss shot with and egg until it splits up enough to the poin that the enlarge yoke is destroy this guy I think shout multiple eggs at the same times the exact damagage resitance is not clear because he does it so fast.The Next boss is and enlarged boo using magic the evil minion of Baby bowser enlarge it. Hit him with five eggs each hit he will expand after the fifth eggs hits he will explouded and be reduce to endoplasimic goy d one in the box we be fast he be slow! (A alternation of a quote from ghostbuster 2"Four forth boss it is simple all you got to due is push the  jar of the edge by applying more pressure than the shy  guys that are try to push it back from the center of the platform. This was a toll assited run some you maye have to do it more than once in the real game with out enhancements to defetas this boss but that is the general method for defeating this boss.  27 minutes into this video will continue after second appoint ment with Jannet gets done around 2 because next appoint is not until 2:45 its only about 2 to  15 minute walk or run.  Going to play yugio don't think I can beat the arcade ninja turtles in under 15 minutes yet not good enough at dogging and countering yet.For the fifth boss the frog instead of making the frogg bigger the evil Koopa that captured baby Lugi and failed to get mario shrinky uo the frog swallows you. You must go inside while doggin the dijest juice hit the gage relexflex with six jumbo size eggs it will flash when hit the boss is defeated you are pulled down the and come out of his but. You will grow to your original size and the frog will be standing there back side up like a beached turtle. Got to go sending the next boss which I think is the enlarge Pirahan plant later. Total damage resitance 1/6 for the frog not sure for the egg  yoke boss was done to quickly. This game is slowed down in parts and saving is done more than usually due to reduce speed and auto or save more often  emulator code.  About 35 minutes into the video minus about 17 to 45 seconds of rewatching.This guy super cheat at the pirhan plant boss taking it down befor it grow to  about size of a full grown naudrey II maybe large. I think he used a push a button to drain energy cheat kind of like the drain boss health with vital which they had on the megaman collection cheats up until the cheats were created four number five or six than they did away with it. Here the really way to beat the Pirahan plant if I remember correctly it grows bigger tries to attack you there is like a sticker with like and X down near the bown of the plant near its root. You got to shot the egg of the wall and across the water at certain angel  you due it right it will hit and plant will flash I think about 2 - 10 time you have to repeat this process with out loosing baby mario. I higly recommend get the starts they increase counnt down time if you are hit so you can rescue baby mario before he is grabbed and taken away you have to repeat from last stage over again until you get through the whole stage with out baby mario getting capturing they also give you a higer point score for the stage you can use your points to by two items per area if you get a certain score.. I belive the max time he can stay of before being captured is about 30 second unless there is a cheat to increase that.  I am about 53/103 the way done with I am past the Pirhana plant the next ball is some kind of dust ball or something like that.  To defeat the this bost ground pound it six time each time it will break up into smalller dust ball after six time it is defeated you have three stage to go before the next boss.  The player is  about to enter the next boss castle. I am getting of in about 2 to 5  minutes  so I am going to fastfoward to the boss then I am going quick email my best friend. Which is a giant turtle.  Hit it with 4 egg and another four hits using those ground pund attack this boss goes down. I am about 59/103 of the way done due to fast forward about four minutes  plus about 2 minutes to watch the boss fight maybe less.  To beat the slug it it has 1/10 ressitance against  hit it ten times it will exploud.  I am now 65 minutes into this  due to 6 minutes of fastfowarding because I only had about 12 to 25 minutes to class started. To defeat the enlarged raven that you fight on the moon hit with three ground pound attack these will send sock waves through the moon or bring up some short of post that will hit it it has a weak 1/3 damage resitance do this move correctly three times it goes down.  75/103 about done with this will post other statistics later.  This boss has 0 percent resitance dfeat him the same way you defeated the first Koopa kids in super marion on. Break enough of  block with out you falling in the Lava will do in this giant porcupine like boss. I am now 84/103 done with this speed run the static will probably be posted withing the next 11 hour 58 minuntes maybe less.  I have three minutes to get to the next boss mninus ten to wait in the loby so I wont me marked trady.  The final boss fight with bowser  has 1/10 damaga resitancte ground pounbd three times when  kid bowser is small it will send a shock wavd due it correctly it will hit he will flash them his wizard maske him grow bibbger than hit him  with 7  bigger eggs froma distanc ehwild doging the flying builders the destroy the platform hit him 7 times there mwill be the explosion effected  he will shrink and take off them you free baby Lugio and the stork and congrulations you have just beat Super Mario world II Yooshi's island.
I remember playing this game growinhgup  when I was inbetween the age of 5 and 13 I rented this for about a week. I only got to the Pirahnha Plnat boss. I though along with Super Metrioid in was on of the harder Super Nintendo games to master. If you were a novice at mario like I was. Here are  boss statics and startegies froma speed run on you tube recently posted. This was done use tool assitance like slowly the game speed down and like saving possibly more frequentylu than normal. The real game may take you longer or more than about 103 minutes or less to complete excluding the credits. But here are some startegties for most of the boss battles. I may have left out one battle before  baby Boswer when you might have to fight the evil Kopa Magican that kidnapped bady Lugi and  appears in ever boss stage making the enemies bigger most of the time. IF you don't want this assitance than close the website and find out on your own I only have about 9 minutes until my class. Yoshi Island Sattics. first boss enlarge has 1/6  damage resitance against egg shot attaacks.Next boss shot with and egg until it splits up enough to the poin that the enlarge yoke is destroy this guy I think shout multiple eggs at the same times the exact damagage resitance is not clear because he does it so fast.The Next boss is and enlarged boo using magic the evil minion of Baby bowser enlarge it. Hit him with five eggs each hit he will expand after the fifth eggs hits he will explouded and be reduce to endoplasimic goy d one in the box we be fast he be slow! (A alternation of a quote from ghostbuster 2"Four forth boss it is simple all you got to due is push the  jar of the edge by applying more pressure than the shy  guys that are try to push it back from the center of the platform. This was a toll assited run some you maye have to do it more than once in the real game with out enhancements to defetas this boss but that is the general method for defeating this boss.  27 minutes into this video will continue after second appoint ment with Jannet gets done around 2 because next appoint is not until 2:45 its only about 2 to  15 minute walk or run.  Going to play yugio don't think I can beat the arcade ninja turtles in under 15 minutes yet not good enough at dogging and countering yet.For the fifth boss the frog instead of making the frogg bigger the evil Koopa that captured baby Lugi and failed to get mario shrinky uo the frog swallows you. You must go inside while doggin the dijest juice hit the gage relexflex with six jumbo size eggs it will flash when hit the boss is defeated you are pulled down the and come out of his but. You will grow to your original size and the frog will be standing there back side up like a beached turtle. Got to go sending the next boss which I think is the enlarge Pirahan plant later. Total damage resitance 1/6 for the frog not sure for the egg  yoke boss was done to quickly. This game is slowed down in parts and saving is done more than usually due to reduce speed and auto or save more often  emulator code.  About 35 minutes into the video minus about 17 to 45 seconds of rewatching.This guy super cheat at the pirhan plant boss taking it down befor it grow to  about size of a full grown naudrey II maybe large. I think he used a push a button to drain energy cheat kind of like the drain boss health with vital which they had on the megaman collection cheats up until the cheats were created four number five or six than they did away with it. Here the really way to beat the Pirahan plant if I remember correctly it grows bigger tries to attack you there is like a sticker with like and X down near the bown of the plant near its root. You got to shot the egg of the wall and across the water at certain angel  you due it right it will hit and plant will flash I think about 2 - 10 time you have to repeat this process with out loosing baby mario. I higly recommend get the starts they increase counnt down time if you are hit so you can rescue baby mario before he is grabbed and taken away you have to repeat from last stage over again until you get through the whole stage with out baby mario getting capturing they also give you a higer point score for the stage you can use your points to by two items per area if you get a certain score..

Here is some data and some static and other information about this game from the mid 1990s area during the last years that supernintendo was in business before It was replace with the nintendo 64 for in between 1996 and  discontinue around 2002 maybe earlier. It's popularity was also short lived. You can beat this game with only 109 shoit is if you find and use the plasma a lot on the bosses the special weapon given to you by the metroid that was captured which ironcially scarfices its self to heal you restore your health if you make it to the final boss fight against mother brain.  Unfortunately ike at ridely the first time when he can't be defeated mother brained iniaties a self desctruct seqeunce upon here defeat you have about 3 minutes to get out of all the chamber  on to your ship and off the planet or your toast. The original metriod  in the mid 1980s was a big hit creating several sequels and prequels including metroid Prim I and Metroid Prim II. The first game is actuallu metroid prime for gamecube. Also  Samus depisite the characters brod shoulders look is actually a girl.  If you die in the game super metrioid her armor dissapeares and she appears naked for a few second then you must reloaded the game from the last save point used .Which this player on you tube that posted this run neglected to use thank good he always healed inbetween bose fights picked up enough spare energy packets to beat all the bosses except for the two sub bosses in about and hour the world speed recorded for this game. Also if you want to know Ridly, and Kraid where destroyed before  Super Metriod in Metriod II return of Samus for either gameboy or game gear Ridly, and Krad were also boss in that game also but were somehow were clone or recreated. In between this game and the prequel Metriod II return of Samus. Got to I hope this information was helpful and interesting.

"Old-School Castlevanias" are those with completely linear quests; that is, you go from Point A to Point B, killing everything in your path (The non-linear games, such as Aria of Sorrow or Sympony of the Night, are sometimes referred to as "Metroid-vania.")In Super Castlevania IV, Simon Belmont steps out to defeat Count Dracula (on a side note, it's not REALLY IV; Konami later admitted that this game is just a re-make of the original 1986 NES Castlevania.)  This being said, Simon has a lot of moves at his disposal.  It this game--the only game in the series to do this--Simon can whip up, down, left, right, or diagonal.  He can flail the whip around.  He can swing from hooks in the ceiling.  Controlling Simon is . . . well, it's a joy.  Play control has never been this tight on a Castlevania game, before or since.All the levels are deep and atmospheric, with perfect music (well, except for the Atlantis Shrine, anyway.)  The music to level one is my personal favorite.  Rooms scroll in the background; vines creep up rail fences as you approach; spider-webs actually look dusty.  The graphics are absolutely amazing, and look better than many graphics on 32 or even 64-bit side-scrollers.An absolute masterpiece of a game.

The old Fed might have changed its name, but nothing is new in WWE WrestleMania X8. While X8 is the first and only GameCube wrestling game to date, it amounts to a disappointing game that will have GameCube owners going to their PS2-owning friends' houses to play SmackDown. WrestleMania X8 is the first wrestling game since WWE took over WCW and got sued by wildlife conservationists, and sadly, that's about all that's new. THQ claimed that X8 would be "back to basics," but the biggest difference between the Xbox's WWF Raw and X8 seems to be the games' rosters. There's no real "season" mode, and what there is lacks the flair of even a Street Fighter game's pre-match flair. Grappling and striking still work in the simplistic, puddle-deep way of every game since the classic Yuke's N64 grapplers (many of Yuke's members came from Aki), and while wrestling fans who just want to be The Rock will be pleased with this, people looking for more control and strategy (&agrave; la Crave's UFC games) will be sorely disappointed. It's time for wrestling games to grow beyond the "Our superstars will sell this" era and add some actual depth to the wrestling. WrestleMania certainly looks great with accurate wrestler models and excellent arenas, but all that beauty is wasted on the slack animation system that lacks the fluidity and realism of motion-captured animations in other games. While X8 is good with scaling characters to their actual relative size (Big Show is much larger than Scotty Too Hotty), the animation system doesn't respect the larger characters, so you get people's arms disappearing inside others' bodies during holds and other mutant effects. Also, for some reason, the female wrestlers look awful. Why the male wrestlers look great and the females look like bipedal goats is a mystery. Yuke's has been making wrestling games for years, but for some reason the company can't seem to settle on a successful control scheme. While the moves are simple and easy to perform, other actions-like picking up tables, climbing the corner ropes, and escaping a steel cage-are unintuitive and annoying. You'll get friction burns trying to escape the cage as you have to jiggle the analog stick and bang the A button to make your character sloooooowlyyyy lifffft hiiis armmmm overrrr the caaage. On the other hand, your opponent only has to run toward the cage wall to knock you down. It's silly and annoying, and it easily deflates the fun of a cage match. Last but not least, X8's sound is purely awful. The wrestlers' entrance tunes sound like they're muted through a blanket over the speaker, and the in-match elevator muzak tears away the WWE attitude the game tries so hard to invoke. It's as if Yuke's thought it was still working with the sound-unfriendly N64. Wrestling fans deserve a great wrestling game, but unfortunately, this isn't it. It had promise, but in the end it's just another WWE game hurt by lack of attention to the game in favor of the license.

I must say, after 10 years that this game STILL holds up well, especially for the GameCube.  When it originally came out, I played a demo of it at Target and was amazed at the gameplay, wonderful animations and graphics of this game.  This great game has awesome gameplay in simulation and arcade mode, which the latter stands out in the game, where you can choose a team and three superstars in an outdoor beach court.  This game is the best in the Courtside series and would highly recommend this game for GameCube owners who are basketball fans. Also, I would recommend to those who are reminiscent of the rosters of this game - Shaq and Kobe on the Lakers, AI on the Sixers, Antoine Walker and Paul Pierce on the Celtics, J. Kidd and Kenyon Martin on NJ, Baron Davis on the Charlotte Hornets, etc.

Why mess with the original.  There are a lot of phonies and copycat controllers that you can get for a discount.  You get what you pay for.  I have several of the standard ones like this and they are quality.  In addition the controls for the Gamecube are similar enough to other Nintendo products so you won't have to learn a completely new system.

I think this game is absoulute perfection.The only thing I wish this game had was more player accuracy.Just like whenever you attack with a general he steps back and then thruste's forward.Well the player should have to press the the back button and then the forward button on the D-pad(direction pad).Anyway's you start of with a long intro and trust me every scene is long.You are a tactician who will help Lyn go through 10 lands.When I first got through Lyn's short 10 chapter's i was so mad because I thought the game was over.But it turn's out that after you finish Lyn's story mode you get Eliwood's story mode.Personally I think Eliwood's story mode is better since you get marcus(a strong paladin) on your team.There are 31 chapter's in all.And the cool thing about this game is that you get 32 character classes.There is a regular class and an advanced class. This is the regular, Knight,myrmidon,merceanery,cavalier,nomad,troubader,peagusesknight,wyvernrider,axefighter,archer,mage,shaman,monk,thief,and pirate. This is the advanced ,General,swordmaster,hero,paladin,nomadictrooper,  valkyrie,falconknight,wyvernlord,warrior,sniper,sage,druid,  bishop,assasin,and berserker.The classes are matched up so since knight is the first on the regulalar list a knight transforms into a general who is the first on the advanced list.Oh yeah,there is also the ultimate classes.Blademaster, greatlord,greatknight,arcshage,and dark druid.The ultimate class is not matched up with the other 2 classes.You get 3 lord's in the game.Hector(axefighter)Lyn(swordfighter)and Eliwood(swordfighter).There are multiple weapon's in the game.Lance's,sword's,axe's,bow's,animamagic,lightmagic,and darkmagic.It's sorta like rock,paper,scissors.Sword's beat axe's,lance's beat sword's and axe's beat lance's.Also anima beats light light beats dark(of course)and dark beat's anima.Bow's don't have a weakness but are good verses peaguses and wyvernrider's.The game really should have been rated for mild violence.And there is some death.Some people say the game has bad graphic's but their just talking about field graphic's.When you attack someone the graphic's are beautiful.And there are also critacle attack's that triple your damage.But I must warn you this game is very addictive.Sometimes I secretly stay up passed my bedtime just to play longer.And also when I get home from school I stay in the car an extra hour just to play.So in conclusion this game is awesome.  Later!!!

This game refined the gameplay of SM, but not that much. What were they thinking with the crappy 2-arm ledge grab?! Fortunately they fixed that in ZM. Storywise this game is awesome, concluding that of Other M nicely. The biggest shocker is the ending. SamusxAdam FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!

This is an awesome remake. It further refined the 2D Metroid gameplay introduced in Super, refined in Fusion, further refined here, and perfected in AM2R. My only qualm is that the ability to turn off your upgrades like in SM was cut out. Fortunately, a ROM IPS patch restores the function. Now all this game needs is DoctorM64's perfections.

This is a game that is like N.F.L. Blitz, just hockey. Because of how it is very unrealistic. There are 3 players on the ice. Codes for using a hockey ball, or tennis ball. Goalies get checked, and can check. Players become on fire. You can be aliens, soldiers, poneys, totempoles, and about 20 others. There also are no penalties. This, though, is a fun game.

WWT is the most innovative game I've ever played. There isn't much to say except, WOW!GAMEPLAY: Wario dishes hundreds of new microgames for you, but you control the game by moving the GBA/SP/DS like a steering wheel. One game has you twisting to avoid baseballs. The game even has built in vibration! Each character has their own unique way of playing.You also have bunches of souviners to unlock, ranging from records, mini-games, doodads, and more. It will take awhile to get everything.GRAPHICS: They look VERY good for a GBA game. Everything is crisp, clear, and colorful.SOUND/MUSIC: Another high-point. The game even has a neat song, Mona pizza. Sung by Wario's hot [better than Peach] girlfriend Mona!This here is Mona Pizza!Makers of the world's best eats-a!Fresh sauce and cheese gal-oreBrought straight to your front do-or!Yum! Yum! Yum! Yum!This here is Mona Pizza!Buon giornoMakers of our tasty treats-a!Buono!Our pie's crispy,crunchy cru-st...!Bellisima...Leaves others in the du-st!Mama Mia!Grab a hot slice ,and take a big bite!It's so good that you'll start a fight for more!Mona Pizza!My name is Joe!Mona Pizza!I'm the manager of this joint!Mona Pizza!It's a pizza art!Mona Pizza!I said-a "pizza art! Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha!We represent Pizza Dinosaur!We got the most stores in the world!Our crust is tough and our sauce is thin!But, we're everywhere, so you gotta give in!Mona Pizza's got nothing on us! Because we have 6,000 stores plus!Pizza Dinosaur!Pizza Dinosaur! Wahahahaha Wahahahaha!Overall, a really fine game that you will really enjoy. It's a new golden area for Wario.
This game rocks!You can make your own team,players can have shark heads,gladiator heads,alien heads,knight heads,and more!You can also play on the moon,in a castle,in a gladiator arena,in shark tank,on a frozen pond,on a pirate ship,and more.You can also check guys through the glass.This is the best hockey game I have ever played!

Hey! So I'm assuming that you are reading this because you what the game is but you are a little unsure on whether you want this game or not. RIGHT? If you have absolutely no idea what this game is about, don't waste your time here, go do some research first (google it!). The point of this is to help you decide, this is not a review that will tell you my opinion and let you learn more about this game. If you want to learn a little more about this game first, you should go read other reviews and come back to this. So, keep on reading if you know what this game is about and is UNSURE on whether to get this game or not.Let me guess, probably from seeing all these positive reviews right? I had the same experience too. All my friends got it and said it was amazing but I was still unsure about wether to get it or not. IF THIS IS YOU... then I'm going to help you a bit :) if not, don't waste time reading this. Go right read other reviews.OK. To help you decide, go through the little "flowchart" I've made. Start with #1, read it and answer yes or no. After you've done that, go the the next question corresponding to your answer. Let me help you with the first question, Do you enjoy shooting games? if your answer was no, you would go read #3 and then answer that question to go to the next and the next until you've reached a verdict.1) Do you enjoy shooting games? YES (go to #2) NO (go to #3)2) Are you good with the touch-screen on the 3DS? YES (go to #5) NO (go to #7)3) Is this game a present? YES (go to #13) NO (go to #4)4) Do you play your 3DS at home more than on the go? YES (go to #6) NO (go to #9)5) Do you play more than 30 min at a time? YES (go to #8) NO (go to #7)6) Are you interested in trying a shooting game? YES (go to #5) NO (go to #10)7) Do you get frustrated easily? YES (go to #10) NO (go to #4)8) Like playing with friends? YES (go to #11) NO (go to #12)9) Have steady hands? YES (go to #5) NO (go to #10)10) Tight on money? YES (go to C) NO (go to B)11) Have little or no games on your 3DS? YES (go to A) NO (go to B)12) Do you like collecting every items in a game? YES (go to #11) NO (go to #10)13) Is this person 10 or older? YES (go to A) NO (go to C)A) GET THIS GAME! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR???B) YOU'LL LOVE THIS GAME. BUT NOT NOW. MAYBE LATER. Buy only if you get that "urge" of getting this game. If you don't know what I'm talking about... don't get this yet. I would recommend waiting for a price drop or a special deal.C) Nah, maybe you should think about it more. You might end up wasting your money on a game you're not going to enjoy. (I'm not saying you won't but you should do some more research before you decide)
Even though it came out early in the year, I'm willing to say that it's probably going to be the best DS game of 2009 (at least in its genre).  This game is completely solid in almost every way, including top notch graphics, music, artwork, storyline, dialog, difficulty (it's not too easy), and playability.I can pick up this game any time, and the way the game is built makes it easy to play in short installments, so if you are on the go a lot or simply have very little time for games it works out rather nicely; if you have a lot of time you can simply play through it.  You can stop the game at any time, and since it's a turn based strategy it's not really important if you are away from the game for a while (no perceived loss of continuity).  The plot is enough to make the game interesting, but not so much that you'd important details over time.  I find myself going back to this game more than any others in my DS collection.Every DS owner should have this game, even if just to round out your collection with a finely balanced strategy game.  It's accessible to beginners and yet meaty enough for expert players.  The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars of fun is because it is not the most awesomely engaging game I've ever played, but it has its moments and is otherwise a consistently good experience.The only thing that is bad about this game is the multiplayer, but as a DS owner I've become accustomed to horrendous multiplayer.  As this is chiefly a single player game, it doesn't really affect my opinion of it.
I am a huge Kirby fan as is my five year old son. We have almost every Kirby game out there and many of the toys as well. If you were a fan of the wii game than this is a must buy because the graphics and game play are very similar to that game. There are a few new powers that are fun to use and the art is beautiful. If you will be playing on a 3ds the 3D does look pretty cool.If you are a hardcore gamer that loves to play the most challenging game out there then this game is not for you, but if you want a fan game with a great story that is not so hard you want to pull your hair out, give this game a try. It is a little difficult for my five year old because of some of the new features (hypernova Kirby where he has to suck up objects while backing up). I am sure with time he will get better with it. He loves trying and he loves the mini fighter games.What I love about this Kirby game and many others is that fighting the bosses is only half the battle. Much of the game is spent looking for jewels and key chains. I love that there is some exploring to do after the game is over or a level has been beaten. I have read some reviews that claim the game is too easy, but if you find it too easy use a different power or try going into battle without a power. I find the game to be the perfect level of difficulty. I hate playing games that seem impossible. Kirby is a fun game for all ages and I would highly recommend it!
This game was released in the early 90's, a time in which video game makers still focused more on fun gameplay rather than graphics and sound.  These days it seems more and more video game makers just want bragging rights for the best graphics and sound, therefore abandoning the most important aspect of the game; rushing out games that are clearly not finished and very little regard to actual gameplay.With that being said, at the time Zelda:Link to the past had very good graphics and sound to boot.  But what kept me playing this game over and over again was the fun gameplay!  I originally got this game when I got a replacement SNES and this game was bundled with it.  It took me over a year to play it, because I thought to myself, there is no way it could be better than the original Zelda on the NES.  One day I decided to pop this game in and realized that I was WRONG!  This was the most fun game I had ever played on the SNES even better than Super Metroid in many aspects.  It was very easy to pick up and play and easy to learn.  Once I started playing, I just could not stop.  It took all the aspects I loved from the original Zelda on the NES and multiplied them!This game was very succesful in capturing the nostagalistic feel of the original game while at the same time allowing me to enjoy a brand new one.  Absolutely fantastic.You still have to search for heart pieces, weapons, upgrades etc, but this game like the original makes it fun rather than tedious and boring.  I got a real sense of accomplishment when I found a new item and a even greater feeling when I finally beat the game.  This game was fun from start to finish and was never once bored, when I stopped playing this game after a long sitting, it was because I physically couldn't continue, not because I was bored or tired of playing the game.  In fact if I picked this game up today, I know that I will STILL enjoy it as much as I did back then!Its too bad that these days, I am finding myself rushing through a game just to finish it because other than the great graphics the gameplay is subpar and it gets boring after a while.  Rushing through a game causes one not to really appreciate the game and it tells me that the gameplay is lacking and the developers did not do enough to keep the player involved.Honestly, if I had to choose between a game with superior gameplay and OK graphics or a game with superior graphics and OK gameplay, I would choose the gameplay over the graphics everytime. While you get your occasional blockbuster on today's systems, for the most part the games are just all fluff and no substance!

This game is excellent any way you put it. I remember playing it for the first time about 12 or 13 years ago (yeah that IS a very long time), and I thought it was just the greatest thing ever. The graphics were supurb and even to this day they look beautiful. Though they don't stand up to ps2 graphics...it really doesn't matter with these old-skool games. I'm not a graphics kind of guy and never was, so it doesn't affect me, but if you are really into high tech graphics and haven't played this, i doubt you will like it. Don't get me wrong, some games with more high tech graphics are good, but this game (along with many others on SNES) proove that graphics don't make any game. But then again I don't play or own a playstation 2, so that's just how I see it. My views on videogames are rather conservative. If you are still under 16 and haven't played this game I doubt you will like it though, as it doesn't appeal to younger payers any more due to it's old school design that kids tend not to appreciate these days. But that doesn't mean kids won't like it. I just think people who have played it in the early 90s are mainly the ones who will enjoy it nowdays, unless you're a Zelda fanatic but haven't played this one yet, or if you like older games but haven't gotten around to getting this one yet. The music on this game is also very good, although the dungeon music can get very tedius and annoying, it's not that bad. The world music is classic, though and after you play it enough it will be ringing in your ears. Gameplay also doesn't get much better, you get a whole arsenal of items. Much more than any other Zelda yet. This game is basically the game that set the standards for all other adventure games, sometimes even RPGs. Another thing you might like about this game is that it is not way too time consuming, if you have a life to attend to you can do so while keeping up with the game as well. Even though I like really long games, this game is short in a good way. But the first time you play it , it will probably take more than 10 hours to beat, at least. If you get all the heart containers it will take even more. There isn't a lot of text in this game either, there's talking sequences but they usually end pretty quick...All in all this game is classic, and if you haven't played it-that's your mistake. Playing this game and hearing it's music after years really brings back those great childhood memories. Even to this day this game looks better to me than most new games. It just has that aura. I highly recommend this to any one into adventure games or RPGs that has a taste for the classics, or anyone who likes SNES or NES games.

I'm a causal gamer and this was one of the best games I ever played. I just beat it on easy, and it was still pretty challenging to me. I don't know what normal is like, but I have a feeling it might be too much for  me. I had my doubts, that I was going to  beat the final Boss! After I beat him, I beat him again about 10 times just because it was that much fun. I'm going to go back and play a couple of my favorite stages again. Usually after I beat a game that's it for me. But this game is different. I might try to play normal, but I really think I'd be in over my head . It's still very satisfying for a causal gamer like me, to beat this on easy, because easy is the over statement of the century .I was tempted to check my blood pressure while playing this game because it's that intense ! I have to laugh when I read about players finishing this in 5 hours. I spent that much time trying to beat one of the Boss's in this game.You owe it to yourself to pick up this game, you'll thank me later. The best 12.00 I ever spent on a game.
Many a gamer will without a doubt have played this game! This was the first game I ever played...EVER and let me tell you that this is the game that got me started on being a gamer!  The first side-scrolling adventure ever made and it was great.But if you're not an old-skool gamer or you're just so much more impressed with all the new stuff then you might as well skip this. Let me say that a game shouldn't be judged based on it's age, graphics and sound alone.  This game taught me that the importance of a game was it's gameplay and that my friends is what this game is all about.First let me say this though, there was one moment in this game that made me realize that games are meant to be explored, and you know what that is? That invisible block in the first level! When I first found that invisible block I was in awe because it was in the middle of NO WHERE but just appeared.  I actually let that one-up get away the first time. I'd never seen anything like it before in ANYTHING!Now I know that people complain, &quot;Oh you can't save&quot; and &quot;You only get three lives and when you die you start from the beginning&quot; and &quot;There's a @#$%^&amp;* time limit!&quot; and of course everyone's favorite &quot;These graphics suck&quot; and second favorite &quot;The game is too short&quot;.  Well, as I said it isn't the age that counts.  For it's time these graphics were some of the best the world had ever seen!  Also, the ability to save your game wasn't in thought yet (Metroid was one of the first games to even use the &quot;Password&quot; system).  You got three lives on just about EVERY game back then and as I said, saving hadn't been thought of.  The lentgh? You certainly wouldn't think so now but Super Mario was one of the longest games in the world when it was released! For today's standards the difficulty has gone down (but I'd still say it's easier than the majority of XBOX, PS2 and GCN games) but not by much.  The game can still be hard but it's easy to master. In fact this game started a series of Video Game challenges in which people did crazy things like go through the entire game without grabbing a single mushroom on one life WITHOUT warping! I remember doing that as well.For the ages this game is freakishly awesome.  Even those born in my time would know this game pretty well and have fun with it (Some of us were like what...one? two? three? etc.?)Truly if you're an NES fanatic and an old-skool gamer this is one game you CANNOT be without!

I am 16 years old and have been a fan of Wallace and Gromit for a long time. When I saw this game for sale a couple of years ago, I felt like I had to have it, so I got it, and I don't have any regrets.The game is an interactive sequel to Nick Park's award-winning short film, 'Wallace and Gromit in The Wrong Trousers.' In this game, you take on the role of Gromit, Wallace's faithful sidekick, in an attempt to foil the evil Feathers McGraw's plan to take over the zoo and make diamonds. As Gromit, you'll move from one challenging level to the next, rescuing baby animals that Feathers has imprisioned and collecting tools and other items to build a bunch of wacky devices needed to advance in the game. And the game includes a bunch of extra features, including a clip on how the game was made, clips from 'The Wrong Trousers,' and 'The Snoozeatron,' the latest installment in the Cracking Contraption series.The game's graphics are really a thing to see. While they don't look very realistic, they look almost exactly like they do in the original claymation. I think that any Wallace and Gromit fan should add this game to their collection of Wallace and Gromit merchandise.

It was a good buy, but the console is pretty old.  the light on it is dim, but manageble.  I would recommand to others.

Many have wanted to compare this to Fifa 2002. I will give the true comparison that all you soccer game fans want to here. First in graphics Fifa wins. That is my opinion all though it is fairly arguable. Fifa has detailed player animations and realistic fields (the grass in my opinion is jaw dropping). Yet in soccer slam you will see bright cartoonish graphics. No, this is not aa bad thing it actually brings a nice fun tone to the game. Sound goes to Soccer slam in my opinion. Why the announcer is a weird cowboy guy who makes you laugh with his wild antics. The music is lacking but the players make up with it with their insults that leave you laughing to the point where it hurts. Fifa's sound is also great. The thing i disliked was the monotonous announcers. The thing that was good was the in-game souns and soundtrack featuring songs by the guerriliz. In fun soccer slam wins. The players are original and cool. From a scottish boxer to an african medicine man. There are three players and a goalie per team. There are cool kicks and exiting passes. Yes, you can hit your opponent without being charged with a foul. Fifa too is fun  but lacks character originality and a fast paced game. The final category is replay value. I believe Fifa has more replay value. In soccer slam once you have beaten the continental cup you feel like you are done. Soccer slam features 6 teams and 9 feilds. Fifa has countless teams, challenges, and goals. Which leaves you coming back for more. A few last notes are the multiplayer is very fun ...Thankyou for your time

Soccer Slam is one of the most well polished games I have ever had the pleasure of playing. The Matrix-stylied shots are some of the best I have ever seen! But one downfall is the belly button physics are horrible. El Fuego's is sticking out like a sore thumb...literally. Half-Pint's belly button definetly isn't half pint. But the graphics are definetly above average. The character animations are literally un"friggin"believable. But it's just plain kiddy.

I bought Mario Kart Super Circit expecting the quallity to fit sega genesis, but i was suprissed. This game is AWSOME and i would recomend it to anyone. Awsome graffics and game play. It is exacaly like the Nintendo 64 grafficly but different corses.

Eeeee'Gad, bROthers anD SIstErs... I finally found me a copy of the N64 Conker!  Been a weeeee Li'l adventure over 3 years to get my hands on one... and after hearing so much, friend's recommending it, and reviews galore... and wondering what the heck it was all about... ah, cripes... the bloody bloke has stole my heart! "Hey!  Don't forget me... there's moNeEy over here!"

Get ready jump, wriggle and giggle with this avant guard collection of mini games that is certain to have you and your friends howling with laughter!
He's driving up the sidelines, quickly traps the ball in his feet and jumps over the defender, sends the ball like a bullet over to his teammate, the player heads into a stadium spotlight, OH MY GOD is this guy casting for &quot;The Matrix&quot;? Anyway he's doing flips in the air, he rears back to shoot, AND HE'S SUCKER-PUNCHED WHILE IN THE AIR! He goes down hard, with the other team in control of the ball, and goes on fire! He charges up the field and tackles some skinny guy that has sparks of electricity coming out his ears. A wrestler from Mexico gets control and shoots from midfield...HE SCORES!End Score: 16 El Fuego, 14 Electra.A normal &quot;Sega Soccer Slam&quot; match.If you didn't get a clue from what you just read, this game is out of whack. In a good way. With six three-man one woman teams. Actually you can't tell what the frigg the goalies are because they have heavy body armor on. As I said before, this is one messed (but cool) game. It provides with more fun then some bestselling games that I will not speak of or everyone on earth will be out to get me. This game is almost like NHL HITZ 20-02 because of the three player action. (The goalies can't be controlled, but they're good enough.) And to clear things up the guy that went on fire was really a skinny girl with strange hair. And fire is El Fuego's natural power. Electra uses bolts of electicity. A team which its name escapes me has poison. Overall, this game is new and exciting.And1homerun's Rating: A+Anyone will like this game. Buy it for all ages.

Killer instinct is a fighter that showed up during the huge flare up of fighting games. It is similar to mortal Kombat in a few ways but executed differently in others. Both games revolve around special moves and combos. Killer instinct focuses on the combos more then anything, with an announcer who will announced your combo based on how long it lasts. I.e 3 hits is a super combo and 29 is an ultra combo. The game has a learning curve that all fighters demand but with practice and patience you can get the hang of it

Now I'll be reviewing Mortal Kombat 4 which is hated by some some do like it they The MK Team was trying to change it with the times & I'll admit it's not as good as Mortal Kombat II, 3, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 or Mortal Kombat Trilogy it has it's problems but I like it. MK 4 came out in The Summer of 1997 it was the last Mortal Kombat game to be in arcades most of the principle characters return Liu Kang, Raiden, Johnny Cage, Reptile Sub Zero & Scorpion. Goro returns which kind of pi s  s  es me off 1 he's harder than he was in MK 1 or MK Trilogy 2 he wasn't even in MK 4. You fought Quan Chi as The sub boss. Jax & Sony are back.  Some of the newer characters I didn't care for like Reiko he was a poor substitute for Noob Saibot but Noob is a secret character he has no ending though. Goro is another secret character & he has no ending so it's pretty pointless. I hate Kai. Jarek is just another poor substitute for Kano. Ilike Fujin Quan Chi Tanya is alright. Shinnok is cool to play as. Story is Shinnok escaped The Neterreln thousands & thousands of years ago Shinnok was an Elder God he betrayed them he needs this powerful amulant. Raiden & Shinnok fought over it & ended with millions of people dying Shinnok was banished to The Neterreln. While The Invasion Of Earthrelm was going on Noob Saibot helped Quan Ch get Shinnok out of The Neterreln. Shinnok overtaken Edina takes Kitana hostage. Kitana is Liu Kang's love of his life all around good time girl. So Liu Kang helps Raiden. Shinnok has killed most of The Elder Gods except for A Wind God Fujin. Quan Chi & Scorpion have a history he tells Scorpion yes that Sub Zero is lying about being a brother that he ready killed his clan & his family. Also Tanya a new fighter & Reptile join to help Shinnok. Tanya's job is trap Liu Kang & have him killed & if you're seen her ending she does it's not official Liu Kang lives on until MK V. Shinnok agrees to send him back in time to his original race if he helps him Reptile is lied to again Since Shinnok is a fallen Elder God the battle can be won by Motals. Jax & Sonya are hunting down A Black Dragon guy named Jarek & if you have beat this game as Jax it's a really bad a  s  s ending. The FMV endings look better on The PS1. It's not perfect the main boss Shinnok I Quan Chi should've been the boss instead he's in most of the endings.  Nothing wrong with Shinnok I'll say this he's better than The Dragon King or Blaxe cause they were straight forward run of the mill monsters. But when you compare him to Shang Tsung or Shao Kahn he doesn't measure up. The game has a lot of in your face gore. This game got ported to The Playstation & Nintendo 64 & an expanded version called Motal Kombat Gold on The Sega Dreamcast. The 64 version has the advantage that it's a cartridge no load time but The 64 controller isn't made for fighting games. The Playstation version has better picture quality for the endings & you can get an arcade stick for it. I've never played or have Dreamcast but I've heard MK Gold is glitchy but Kung Lao, Baraka Kitana, are added I think it has Millena & Cyrax. I don't know if MAME will run it. This woulalso be the last game Of  The Boon Tobias era. Next is going to be an all time gulity pleasure Motal Kombat Anhillation.

I got this game because I wanted to learn how to cook great food. I can describe this better as a digital and interactive cookbook. It lists different foods from all sorts of countries. From the US to France to Italy to Germany and Russia, this game had  245 recipies for foods from many countries and a discription on how to cook them. This game also features a kitchen timer, a list of recipies that can be catagorized by ingredients and step by step instructions with the chef's voice to help aid with cooking. I highly recommend this game for beginners and for people who aren't experienced with cooking.
I skipped over several Pok&eacute;mon games over the years. I was a Generation 2 guy playing Pok&eacute;mon Gold in the days where 250 whopping Pok&eacute;mon to collect. But when I purchased a 3DS in 2011 I decided it was time to get back into Pok&eacute;mon. I purchased the Gold remake first and then played it intently. A few years later I pre-ordered and played Pok&eacute;mon Y to completion. I had Pok&eacute;mon from HeartGold I wanted to transfer but the new transfer system would not work with that game.So I set forth to purchase a copy of White and White 2.First of all, Pok&eacute;mon White treats its audience like intelligent participants in a world that is unfriendly and wild. This is clearly an E +10 game and is in no way a hardcore title... but it presents a complex question to it's audience... Is fighting Pok&eacute;mon, collecting Pok&eacute;mon, and trading Pok&eacute;mon ethical? And like any good question there is no straight answer. Even the best player of Pok&eacute;mon has a Pok&eacute;mon in their PC storage that they have not used in a very long time. Is that Pok&eacute;mon lonely? Are they hungry? Are they claustrophobic? None of this is truly answered.But beyond that, this game plays smoothly as an individual title with small rewards if you play the associated Pok&eacute;mon Black title. Unfortunately for collectors, you cannot trade Pok&eacute;mon between White and it's older peers Pok&eacute;mon Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, SoulSilver. There is an annoying minigame to transfer these Pok&eacute;mon six at a time from one cart to another, but it requires patience. It irked me that I could not simply trade between them. Speaking of trading, Pok&eacute;mon White 2 has full trading capability to the best of my knowledge.The Pok&eacute;mon in this title are some of the best I have seen. I am still favoring the Gen 1-2 style but the Gen 5 Pok&eacute;mon really set the environment well. From lumbering stone ghost golems to brilliant blustering eagles, this set of Pok&eacute;mon is worthy to collect.As a whole, I would recommend this title to anyone from ten years old to thirty five. It asks good questions about the game played and sets a standard for Pok&eacute;mon games in the future. While not perfect, it really seems to be the definitive DS incarnation of Pok&eacute;mon so far. And White 2 improves upon the shortcomings of White with more activities, seasonal changes, competitions, mini-games, and good ol' fashioned Pok&eacute;mon battles. If you are planning to get Pok&eacute;mon White's PokeBank then I would certainly suggest getting this game to round out your collection.
I loved Golden Sun, so I was very excited about playing this sequel.  At first, I was disappointed because you are no longer the character in the first game.  In fact, you won't hook up with Isaac and the gang until way into this game.  You are now Felix, the kid who was swept away in a stream back in Vale and who seemingly joined the darkside but, since you are now taking control of his character, he must not have been so bad after all.  So, instead of starting out with Isaac, Garet, Ivan, and Mia with their level 31 powers, you need to start all over again with a new posse of characters.  I guess this makes sense as you do not need to complete the GS1 to play Lost Age.  The first team will have all the powers you gained for them in the first game, but they won't be needed too much.  Djinn Flash and Granite and some of Ivan's psynergy will pretty much be the only pivotal things they bring to the group.There are several things different about Lost Age than GS1.  First, I found that I used attack Djinn much more often in battles.  I almost never used psynergy to fight.  Psynergy was almost exclusively used for performing tasks and solving puzzles.  You get a lot of new psynergy like Tremor, Scoop, Pound, Sand, Cyclone, Hover, Blaze, Burst, Teleport, and Parch.I also noticed that I hardly bought any weapons, armor, or healing items.  Most of the stuff I used I found (including the ultra powerful Sol Blade), earned in battle, or won at the Contigo slots.  Consequently, you can amass a ton of coins (coins were much more precious when I played GS1).  One of the most useful purchases will be Mist Potions in Prox near the end of the game in preparation for your final showdown, and money will be no object by then.  I had almost 415,000 coins before my final boss battle, over double what I had in GS1.Another difference about this game is you'll be able to travel by ship to different continents.  This ship will also have wings built on it so you can fly over certain barriers (alas, not all barriers).You get a better idea what's going on here, too.  It seems that, because the lighthouses are not lit, there is no longer enough elemental energy to grow and sustain the world.  A map reveals that the continents of the world are shrinking.  The beacons of the four lighthouses thus must be lit (Venus will be lit at the beginning of the game).  Isaac and the gang did not know this in GS1.A lot of things I loved about GS1 are in Lost Age.  There are many different places to see and things to do.  There is also excellent music that changes with almost every place you go.  The melancholy music in Garoh fits the tale of the lycanthropes who take the form of werewolves because they borrow powers from beasts and are, therefore, often considered beasts is a beautiful combination.  I kept that part saved on my game for a long time.  You can also save the game anytime, except during battles, which is an incredibly useful feature.Another similarity to GS1 is that, in LA, the toughest battle is not the last.  It is the Star Magician on Treasure Island.  I would not tackle it right away.  I would wait until you find the powerful Sol Blade in the Mars Lighthouse on the other side of the world and backtrack to Treasure Island.  The Star Magician is aided by four balls (or spheres, if you will).  You need to defeat his strongest spheres in the following order of priority: 1. Guardian Spheres, 2. Refresh Sphere, 3. Anger Spheres.  Only after the magician has 4 Thunder Spheres do you attack him.  Unlike other boss battles, you do not use summons.  Set all your Djinni, and attack with Felix's Sol Blade.  Sheba and Piers should alternate Flash and Granite.  I tried Shade instead of Granite but it did not work.  Shade allows a little more damage which is just enough to prevent me from keeping my guys alive.  Jenna should either be using Flower or healing psynergy.  She should also have some Mist Potions and Waters of Life just in case (maybe divide them up between Felix and Jenna).  This strategy will take a long time--maybe 45 minutes--but it will work eventually.  If it goes right, you won't even need to use Isaac's team.  It took me many tries to beat this dude.  Incidentally, you do not need to defeat the magician to beat the game, but why not go for it?!  This strategy will also work in the final boss, the Doom Dragon.Another difficult part was a room full of Hover pads in the Jupiter Lighthouse.  You have to stay above the Hover pads to keep hovering but a whirlwind will force you onto some broken tiles and, if you're there too long (which seems like just a nanosecond), you'll fall through the floor and have to start all over again.  After many tries and many swear words, I discovered that if you leave the hover pads and return to them at a angle, you'll shave off just enough time to make it.  I did this twice, to the right to activate one of the statues to the lighthouse, and to the left to pick up the Phaeton Blade, which was the most powerful weapon I had found up to that point.  As it turns out, the Phaeton Blade is not that powerful compared to other weapons you will get and I ended up selling it so you really only need to conquer the Hover pads once on the right side of the room and save yourself the frustration of having to do it twice.The end of the game was neat but I was a little disappointed because I was looking forward to returning to Vale (the first town in GS1).  Seeing that town again with that old music would be a real treat.  As it turns out, that will be impossible.  Oh well, I'm more nostalgic than most.  I definitely recommend beating GS1 before playing Lost Age, although it is not necessary.  I think you will love this game so much you'll want to play both, so you might as well play them in order.  As always, get a walkthrough!  Good luck, adept.

I simply loved the first Golden Sun, but this game was phenonomal! If you played the first game you pretty much know what's going to happen in this game, but WHO CARES! The main idea throuhout the game is that Felix and his gang (Felix, Jenna, Sheba, and Piers) are attempting to light the Jupiter and Mars Lighthouses and restore Alchemy to the world. Gain new psynergies, fight intimidating bosses, and team up with Issac and company and light the remaining lighthouses!

If you can find my review of Zelda; Oracle of the Ages...you will find more of my experiences.The game is great.  I am not.  I am going to have to go to the Cheats you can find Online and figure out how to get anywhere in this game.  Not their fault.  The Game Boy Advance little compacts are the most beautifully designed pocket games ever made.  Their charge lasts a long time, and the entire unit lasts and lasts.  These little Warioland 4 and Zelda, and Castlevania cartridges are a joy to own.  If you still  have one, hang on to it.  You can still buy a charging unit for not too much $ and too many kids let their parents talk them into trading them for the next new thing.  The parents (too bad) did not apparently play them.  The children were too young to know their value.  I started playing Mario Pinball and Warioland 4 when I was 73.  At  75, besides being an active harpist and trumpet player in community bands....I still play these games.  They are exquisitely created and a joy to have!nancy morse

ok, &quot;pokemon snap&quot; for the N64 used snapping pictures as a new idea for a video game. This game pushes that envelope even farther.You are Jade, a journalist on a planet that is being bombarded by alien atacks. The ALPHA group protect and serve the public, or so they are assumed to. Your mission is to infiltrate the ALPHA group, uncover the goverment secrets and bring back photographic proof to the public that a major conspiracy is underway.Day and Night pass quickly though they don't have much effect on your playing. One of the side missions is to photograph every speicies of alien life on the planet. Since there are over 500, you're gonna be doing alot of snapping between missions.the play controle is excelent, and the graphics are amazing. This world that UBiSoft has create is massive and ever changing. Many of the things you can interact with easily. There are lots of people to talk to, and you are given more than just 1 thing to ask for each one, giving you much more control over how you want to gather information. The picture taking aspect is really nifty and setup so that it's easy to switch back and fourth between the camera and stealth.There is a very nicely cast group of actors doing the voices and you never get bored with them (they very rarely repeat themselves, instead they are more action oriented: giving you advice and talking to you as you go through the levels).I give this game a 4 because of the picture ratings. unlike Pkemon Snap which graded you on the ability you had in taking pictures, this game just requires you to have the character centered. They don't even have to be pointing at the camera (something i've noticed when i've taken pictures of the back of people's heads and yet the pictures are accepted!)all in all, this game is very detailed. Their use of cinematic scenes are exceptionally well done and the modeling of the characters is top-notch. If you're looking for something different, i'd stronly recommend this game.Rated T for comic mischief and violence

You quitly step out of your spaceship onto the sandy, damp ground of an unexplored planet. Suddenly, a giant flash of lightning appears as it starts to rain heavily. You nervously look behind you. Nothing there. In a hurry to get away from the rain, you run under a near cave. After going through an old, broken door another lighting flashes and an intemidating roar of thunder follows. You slowly continue to walk through the abondoned, lifeless cave. A slight glisting of metal appears as you approach a peice of torn machinary. Traveling depper, you find the entrence to an old advanced shelter of somekind. After exploring somemore, you return to this enterence spot. A flash of lighting lights up the place again and you find a giant insect mantis like creature staring right at you. In a hurry you fire your beam at it and destroy it. An ear-wrentching cry echoes the halls as you see there are tons more of them, crawling on the walls jumping down from the ceilings, surrounding you. In a hurry, you attack them one by one and run to the cave enterence of the place. Suddenly, it lights up with life. Giant crab like insects start crawling down the walls, trilobites flee as the abondoned bunker becomes housed again, lights flicker on and off and motion is constantly seen throught this once desolate and quiet place. Only not one human or freindly creature is moving. Thats basically the opening sequence of Super Metroid. Constantly through this game will be intense and sometimes freighting moments of suspence. There is also always very satisfying action to follow. You play as Samus Aran, who has really cool sumersaulting jumping techniques. Also, she can shoot something right at a pin of a target while sumersaulting through the air ten yards away. Shes a really cool character with a really cool suit and a really cool arsenal of firepower to go with it all. Plus, a really cool game. Most of the game will be taken up exploring places, finding new abilitys/weapons in those places, and using those abilitys to gain acces to and explore other places. Most of these enviroments are dark, suspensefull, and gloomy like the one described above. The game also features some inovative enemys that can be destroyed challengly and satisfyingly no matter how you fight them. It has some really great graphics, too. But, the one con, and its a big one to, is that after watching the opening cutscenes, theres almost no story left. You'll alot of times be wondering if youre supposed to be in an area or not supposed to be there, with no real knowlege of where to go or what to do next. Just little hints like you've accomplished a big task in an area and feel that the next big task is in another big area. Other than that, this game is a really great classic and should be played by all at least once. It really almost plays identically to Metroid: Fusion, so a learning curve would be very small since alot of people have probably played fusion by now.

Metroid Prime came out in late 2002 and shocked all compitition with its amazing graphics, emensis monsters, in a FPS with mostly a hunt and retreve mode.The game of the year for 2002 was taken place in an uncharted world named Tallon 4. Samus came to destroy half of the remaning Space Pirates from the original 2D game Metroid, she loses most of her abilities in an crash in a pirate frigate early in the game, she must collect all of her missing arsanal of weapon, suit, and visior ,over the course of the game, from the far corners of Tallon 4's climate(Tallon overworld, Phazon mines, Magoorn caverns, Chozo ruins, and Phindendra drifts), hunt the space pirates ,as well as their leader Ridly, and recover the sacred Chozo artifactes to get in the Phazon crater to see what made the Chozo bird-like people to go away and turned the animals into monsters.

For those who loved the classic NES Metroid and it's superior SNES version, you are in for an unconventional, but pleasant, surprise.Metroid Prime takes place after the events of the NES Metroid game with famed bounty hunter Samus Aran tracking pirate activities on the planet Talon IV, which neighbors Zebes.  After discovering that the planet has become a base of operations for the pirates, Samus descends planetside to have a look around.  She discovers the pirates and their plans, as well as ancient secrets of the Chozo, and a horde of severely mutated creatures, including the dreaded Metroids.The sheer variety of things to do would be enough to keep you coming back, but Retro Studios has made the action so enjoyable and the graphics so lush, that the game draws you in quickly and completely.

This is the 3rd installment to the metroid series. And probally one of the best. It was the first of the metroid games to have a map of the areas and a section that told what you have collected so far. It takes place after samus aran finishes off the metroids on the planet SR388 which is roughly about oh maybe 6 months-1 year after the origional metroid. Ridley, a massive teridacle like creature (also from the origional metroid) goes to the space coloney (a massive research station used by the intergalactic federation police) to take the baby metroid which latches itself to samus in metroid 2. after samus lays some damage on ridley it takes off with the metroid and selfdestructs the coloney. samus then escapes and follows the flying feind to the space pirates own base....the origional home of samus aran! (i found that out reading some metroid manga, japanese comics) the game is outstanding. if you have a super nintendo you have to get this game. but if you dont have patience and cant exept a defeat here and there you will probally smash this game in a mad rage. but this game is the best with some seeings of some old enimes such as ridley, kraid, and the mother brain. and some new ones such as draygon, crocomire, and phantoon. this game is amazing the name is super metroid, the platform is super nintendo, and the fun level is infinity!

Ridley, a massive teridacle like creature (also from the origional metroid) goes to the space coloney (a massive research station used by the intergalactic federation police) to take the baby metroid which latches itself to samus in metroid 2. after samus lays some damage on ridley it takes off with the metroid and selfdestructs the coloney. samus then escapes and follows the flying feind to the space pirates own base....the origional home of samus aran! (i found that out reading some metroid manga, japanese comics) the game is outstanding. if you have a super nintendo you have to get this game. but if you dont have patience and cant exept a defeat here and there you will probally smash this game in a mad rage. but this game is the best with some seeings of some old enimes such as ridley, kraid, and the mother brain. and some new ones such as draygon, crocomire, and phantoon. this game is amazing the name is super metroid, the platform is super nintendo, and the fun level is infinity!
Metroid Prime is easily one of the most Atmespheric games I have ever played.  It is the first in the series of a great trilogy of 3D metroid games.  When I first saw the 3D look of the game, I expected it to be completley different than what it turned out to be, I expected it to be something like doom, Halo, or a first person shooter along those lines.  It turned out to be a completely different genre.  I will try and go into detail in telling about about the fantastic game that Metroid prime is.Gameplay:  You Play as the Bounty Hunter Samus Aran.  You see the veiw through Samus's visor.  This game is not a first person shooter, it is a first person adventure.  you start in the frigate Orpheon where you get accustomed to the controls.  You will see Samus actually lift or lower her arm when moving the camera which may seem akward the first 10 minutes you play but you see that it makes sense since She is wearing this big suit and does not realy have a neck.  After you go through the frigate Orpheon and fight the parasitic queen, the ship will begin a self destruct sequence, in which you must escape.  You encounter an old foe on the way out and chase him down to the nerby planet Tallon 1V.  You find that the planet is infested by an evil poisen known as phazon, it is Samus's mission to reaquire her equipment, get the 12 artifacts, fight the mercillious space pirates, and discover and destroy the source of the phazon plaging the planet.  There is alot of creative puzzle solving similiar to Zelda, as well as jumping like in mario, and some realy exciting action.  You will raise bridges, open doors, find secret passages, and much more.  The world of tallon 1V is huge.  You will travel through the rainy Tallon overworld, the crumbling Chozo ruins, The lava filled magmoor Caverns, the Snow coverd Phanderana Drifts, And the pirate run Phazon mines.  The tension builds and builds as you go farther into the ngame to see what excitment lies behind the next corner.  The action is also Very Fun and exciting.  You simply press the L button to lock on to an enemy ( like in Zelda), and just blast away at them.  However the action is not just run and gun shooting, different enemys have different weak spots and some you have to discover their weakness before attacking.  The Boss battles are insane, each with different attacks and counters.  You also have you morph ball form.  rolling into a ball allows you to squeeze through tite surfaces and their are also skateboardingstyle half pipes reach are lots of fun.  The morph ball also gets many upgrade, like the boost ball, and spider ball, and also weapon upgrades.  The morph ball can set three bombs ata a time, and eventually gets the power bomb which explode large debree.  The morph ball is also used creatively in boss battle.  The gameplay is just very entertaining and their are few games that compare.Graphics:  When this game came out in 2002 it ose groundbreaking in the visuall department.  The textures were very detaild, and the lighting was great, their were huge explosions and jaw dropping envirnments.  However bum,p mapping, which some later gamecube games had, was no where to be found, but that is not realy a complaint as it was the best on the console when it came out.  The art also is what still makes this game very pleasent to look at.  The enemys and bosses, and envirnments are so varied and uniqe.  You see drops of rain or smoke come on your visor.  Their are also different vizors which show things in different views, like the thermal vizor which lets you see invisible stuff, and the Z ray vizor showing you what is behind a wall, bridgest are made out of tree branches, bugs burow in the durt, and it all runs at 60 frames per second.sound:  Kenji yamamotos score is as moody as you would expect.  it has been modernized with catchy techno remixes as well as great sound affects.  you can hear a sound when a powerup is nearby.  Space pirates grunt, as well as Samus when she takes damage.  The phandrana drifts theme will stick in your head for quite a while.  The sound affects on the other hand are mostly high quality middy but some of the tracks seem a bit to subtle and even low quality, not many gripes here though.This game realy shows how to take an established 2D franchise and turn it into 3D.  This game is like nthe 3D version of Super metroid, I cannot think of much higher praise than that.

If the game came without the Wiimote, I wound't touch it with a ten foot pole. Amusing two-player games like Found Mii, Pool, Target Practice and Tanks are heaped in with a few mediocre or sometimes frustratingly difficult to control games like Fishing and Laser Hockey.I'd say it's well worth the $10 if you need the Wiimote, but temper your expectations before you buy.
Ok, I bought this game for the Wiimote.  I thought why not, it comes with a wiimote.  I think that this is a fun game.  You get to play duckhunt, tanks, ping pong, find Mii, pool, Pose Mii, lazer hockey, fish, and race on a cow.  The games are fun, but they get a little boring after you play them a hundred times.  My favorites are duckhunt and find Mii.  I recommend this game not only because it comes with a Wiimote, but because the game scan be fun if you get bored with the other Wii games that you have.
Wii Play is a bundle comprised of 9 casual Mini-games and a Wii Remote Control. The Mini-games can be compared to those found in Wii-Sports, which comes standard with every Nintendo Wii. Wii Play features a good mix of small Puzzle, Action and Skill based games. Families will appreciate this variety, as it offers something for everyone. Unfortunately, Wii Play can only be played by 2 Players. We recommend Wii-Play to everyone who is looking for an additional controller: A single Wii-Remote Controller costs $39.99, Wii Play with Wii Remote costs $49.99. Means, for $10 more you get 9 fun Mini-games with a Wii-mote. Pretty much a no-brainer in our opinion.
Wii Play is too little too late from Nintendo.  This game needed to be released at launch.  With games like Wario Ware: Smooth Moves and The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (both of which take great advantage of the Wii Remote), this game comes off as too simple and just not as innovative as Nintendo boasts.Like it's cousin, Wii Sports, Wii Play is nothing more than a small demo of the Wiii's capability.  Shooting Range is an ok game with an amusing allusion to Duck Hunt (kinda wish it WAS an updated Duck Hunt), but it's too short.  Billiards is way too clumsy and tedious.  The ping-pong game is just horrendous!  Stick with Wii Sports: Tennis.  Pose Mii is completely ridiculous.  The only good games are Laser Hockey and Tanks.  Those are the only two I can see myself playing over and over.  Also, the graphics on this game aren't bad.The only saving grace of this package is the bundled Wii Remote.  Since they're still hard to find, it's comforting to know that at least you get a game.  I have to remind myself that I'm really paying $10 and not $50 for Wii Play.
At $50 you're getting the wii remote (MSRP $40) as well as the disc with the Wii Play mini games.  The mini games are along the same line as the wii sports and include billiards, air hockey, ping pong, and fishing games along with a few others.  For the ten bucks, it's really too good to pass up.
What's nice about Wii Play is that it's a combo package: one Wii Remote and the actual Wii Play game.The game is intended for practice to get used to the Wiimote. Although some games don't make sense (Pose Mii game, in which you have to line up your Mii in falling bubbles), most are very fun. In my opinion, the Shooting Range and Tanks are the best of the mini games.If you're going to buy another Wiimote anyway, pick up the Wii Play package; it'll add a little more fun to your console.
Wow. I'm somewhat disappointingly surprised. I never would've expected Wii Play to have a total rating of 3 1/2 out of 5. I thought it was a fun game. What's wrong here? Well, I could only go so far as to explain how exciting this game actually is compared to what everyone else is trying to say.So, Wii Play is, well, a minigame collection. It's no Mario Party, where there's a bunch of them after a turn in a board game. It's no WarioWare, where there is minigame after minigame, and each would be 5 seconds. It is its own minigame collection, with a nice amount to choose from.==Find Mii==A game where you find a certain Mii or a number of the same Mii under a time limit. It is merely just clicking on the Mii(s) to win. Yet, I found it so darn addicting. I could go on forever, but anyone is bound to mess up sometime, clicking on the wrong Miis and having their time limit drop. It's amusing to watch the Miis go up and down escalators, watch a race, float in space, run, and swim in some levels.==Shooting Range==You knew this one would be coming: Using the Wii Remote as a gun is ingenious, and we were all waiting for a title to utilize that. Shooting Range actually resembles NES classic Duck Hunt, except you are shooting targets, soda cans, and UFOs instead. Like Duck Hunt, it's incredibly fun. Although it's short (It spans just a few levels, containing one of the above objects to shoot in each), I would always come and play this one.==Table Tennis==This one is rather flawed. Instead of being an average game of table tennis, it's a rally that you must keep up with the CPU as you hit the ball back and forth. It all ends after you miss the ball once. Playing with a friend IS an average game of table tennis, however, and it just leaves me with a question: Why wasn't single player mode like this?==Laser Hockey==Ooh yes! Laser Hockey is a flashy neon Pong with an AWESOME techno beat. Definitely a fabulous play here.==Pose Mii==In this one, you simply change the pose of your Mii (Which you move around with the Wii Remote) to match the poses of the silhouette of said Mii that's shown in bubbles. Move the Mii into the bubbles to pop them. Like most games in Wii Play, the premise becomes extremely addicting.==Billiards==This is why I said MOST games in Wii Play are addicting. Billiards isn't what I'd call an addicting arcade-style game. As the title implies, this is a simulation of that game that you find in arcades or places like Carolina Ale House. It works pretty well into a Wii game, actually. You must not be clumsy, though, as the game requires you to move the Wii Remote in a rather precise way.==Charge==You're gonna have lots of fun with this one while it lasts. Charge has your Mii ride a rampaging cow running over scarecrows in its path! You can tilt the Wii Remote forward to make the cow move even faster!==Fishing==Not the average fishing simulation, this game has you catch cardboard fish that are somehow alive. It's not as hard as it may sound. You just have to leave the hook in the water for a bit, and the fish will peck at it. Then when one fully snags the hook, now's your chance to yank it out! Once again, it's a fun game.==Tanks==This one is arguably one of the best this collection has to offer. You move a tank around the environment, and you must destroy all enemy tanks to move on. The challenge is being able to conquer all kinds of tanks that may stand in your way, as well as to seeing how far you can go.Overall, most of these games are certainly fun and addicting arcade-style games that will keep you at it for quite a while. It's nice to be able to play with a friend in all of those games, too. Thankfully, this collection isn't that pricey, so you can practically jump right into the fun!
WiiPlay feels more like a demo package for the WiiMote than the WiiSports game included in the Wii box--which is pretty demo-ish.  Some of the games on WiiPlay are cute, but our experience was that they were only fun for a short period of time.  Our favorite was the target shooting game--kids and adults both enjoyed shooting at the targets in a throwback to the classic Nintendo Duck Hunt game--and the game gets really crazy and fun at the end when your surprise visitors show up.I gave this game four stars though, because its a great deal with the included WiiMote.  A WiiMote is typically $39, so at $49, WiiPlay is basically a $10 game added on to an additional remote.  You'll definitely want four remotes, so why not get a bonus game while you're at it?  For that reason, I would recommend WiiPlay to anyone buying a new Wii, or as an add on to people looking to buy extra WiiMotes.
This purchase is almost too easy.  You get a remote control for the Wii and a gamepack.  Granted, the games are by no stretch of the imagination hit releases, but they are some good classics made to Wii format.  Duck hunt?  Yes!  Pool? Awkward, but fun!  Ping pong?  Yao!If this package included the Wii remote attachment piece, it would have been the perfect set.  Remote, attachment and a game - all for a very reasonable price.  Now, Wii technology is getting a bit long in the tooth, but the games are still pretty fun and honestly, it is  the first console to incorporate motion into gaming, so it should get kudos just for that.Overall, the games aren't stellar, but fun - the remote is a nice bonus and the price is hard to beat.  And to ensure you know what you are getting - this is a real licensed Wii remote, not some generic knockoff that will stop working after 2-3 uses.  If you've been looking for another remote and fun way to kill a day inside with the family - get this gamepack and play to your hearts content.
A lot of the reviews for Wii Play are pretty spot on when compared to a regular Wii game, but I don't think it's fair to compare it to a regular game.  When you buy Wii Play, you basically get a remote (worth $40) along with the game, so the dispositive question is whether Wii Play is a worthy $10 game.I would answer that with a resounding YES.  It clearly looks and feels like a technical demo for the Nintendo Wii, but again, it's a $10 game.  If you're into minigames of the type you'd play in Mario Party or Wario Ware, Wii Play is your cup of tea.  You get 9 mini games:Shooting Range - basically duck hunt.  Everybody loves duck hunt, right?  It works surprisingly well with the Wii remote.  Both single-player and multi-player are pretty fun.Find Mii - basically Where's Waldo.  There's a clutter of Mii's (people) on screen and you have to find a pair that match, or a particular Mii, etc.  2-player mode basically awards points to the first person who finds the Mii.  Also fun in single-player and multi-player modes.Ping Pong - control the paddle with the on-screen wii-mote pointer.  Not really that fun, you don't actually use any motions like in tennis, you just direct the paddle on-screen to where the ball is.  It's actually quite similar to the pong/air hockey game.Pong/Air hockey - similar to Ping Pong in concept, you control your paddle on screen with the wii-mote and try to score the puck into your opponent's goal.  Not that great single player, but pretty fun multiplayer since it's a little more frantic than ping pong.Bubbles - guide shapes into bubbles to pop them.  IMO, the worst game of the bunch.  It's basically a reflex game, where you take three shapes and try to fit them into slots by directing and rotating with the wii-mote.Billiards - Pretty fun single player or multiplayer.  A standard pool game.Fishing - Similar to the mechanical board game where you try to stick you fishing pole magnet into the fish's mouth.  Kinda fun for awhile.Cow Racing - Pretty fun, shows off how the wii-mote can be used to drive and steer.Tank - Steer a tank around and lay mines or shoot shells.  It probably has the least amount of wii-mote interactivity (you point on screen to aim your shots, that's about it, everything else is standard console controls).  Lots of people seem to like this one, I didn't so much.Anyways, bottom line is that it's $10.  And it's totally worth the $10.

WrestleManie X8 lacks a lot of the fun features that Smackdown 3 had. It's nice to able have a bunch of special matches when you get tired of Story Mode in Smackdown 3. Here Path to the Championship is torture, have to go through way to many matches to get a title shot. At lease Story Mode is some-what fun the first few times play it and at least you can defend the belt when you win it. Here you can only defend or go for a belt  in a title vs title match  against a friend who won a belt that you need on his memory card. Also just like in Smackdown 3 I find it silly that there's ladder matches but that there's no point in actually winning one if you're not gonna gain a belt in the process. What I like though is that this is the only wrestling game I can think of where you can not only stop a move from happening but stop a finishing move from happening. Plus you can actually reverse moves as well even if that is sort of hard.The wrestling roster is good even if it's missing a lot of wrestlers such as X-Pac, Eddy Guerrero, Billy & Chuck, Billy Kidman, Goldust and Tommy Dreamer. Plus I find it silly that Shane and Stephanie are even on it when they weren't around at all when this game was released. Stacy Keibler being a hidden wrestler is silly too. If their was gonna be a hidden women on the game it should of been one that can at least wrestle like Jazz. There's a lot of wrestlers missing their real ring music as well. Plus the man Hollywood should be able to be used in Red and yellow but that's not an option unfortunetly. A lot of the people on this site called Wrestling Mania X8 the best wrestling game ever before it even came out. That's hardly the case at all but this game is still very playable even if it doesn't add up to much.

The Wind Waker captures the saterday morining cartoon visual on a game. With all the bizzare weapons like the deku leaf and wind waker you solve surpisingly intresting puzzels as you hunt for you sister Ayrell.The Zelda makers used mostly recycled emeimes  and one of the origainal bad-boys Ganon(or Ganondorf). You venture across the sea in your talking boat, the red lion king, in miles upon miles of sea, finding outposts, islands and more outposts.Overal the game is one of the Player Choices, and I personaly think you will enjoy it(Please rate my other reviews).

Wrestlemania X8 was developed by Yukes, who made the Smackdown series, instead of AKI who made every other wrestling game on the Nintendo 64. Yuke's did manage to improve the graphics, some. If this was an N64 game the graphics would be GREAT, but this is the Gamecube. The six different arenas (including Raw, Smackdown, Wrestlemania X8, Summer Slam, Survivor Series, and Royal Rumble) look impressive but the wrestlers look more blocky or cartoonish like in past wrestling sims on a Nintendo platform. Some look better then others and its eay to see that more time was spent on say the Undertaker then Will Regal. The gameplay is different but not bad at all. Its easy to grasp but you don't have a great deal of moves at your disposal, so it can wear a little thin especially in a long match. There are 40 match types (more than any other Nintendo wrestling game but 30 less the the PS2'S Smackdown: Just Bring It!). The cell is by far the most impressive and fun. The matches it does have are all fun except triple threat. The computer AI has a tendacy to not play fair and to gang up on you a lot in a triple threat. To me the AI is the biggest problem but in some ways adds more of challenge to winning a belt. There are four modes (five if you want ot count Options menu). Exibition where you can have any of those 40 match types with up to three other players. Next you have Path of the Champion, which is like story mode without the story. So far I have unlocked Ric Flair by winning the Europeon title and with every title you get you unlock another wreslter. (Rhyno if you win the Hardcore title, Vince McMahon win you win the Intercontinental, Chris Benoit when you win the heavyweight title, Stacey Kiebler when you win the light heavywieght, and Raven when you win the tag titles I belive but I could be wrong). However once you have unlocked the six wrestlers Path of the Champion gets old unless you want to change you title holders as they change in the WWE. There is no Women's championship because there's only about half a dozen women on the game so they must compete for the light heavyweight title. The third and maybe the best mode reliezes the idea introduced in WWF Warzone, being a virtual Vince McMahon. The Battle for the Belts has 51 different title belts each on one of the game's four different difficulty levels (easy, normal, hard, and painful,which is plenty painful). You can win these titles then change the strap color in one player but this mode shines in multiplayer since you can have unifaction matches, defend your belt against a friend, or just see who has the best create-a-wrestler. It like running your own promotion. The Create-Wrestler is the fourth mode and is no where near as detailed as it could and should of been, but it is user friendly, which is good. The game doesn't include Billy and Chuck (but who cares), Maven, Steven Richards, and the recently returned Heart Break Kid but you will find it very easy to create these missing competitors (if you really want Billy and Chuck on your game). The first thing I did on the game was to create HBK which can be done quickly and easily if you wanted to create him. The game also allows you to load off both memory cards (if you have two) like in other Nintendo wrestling games which means you can create a total of 32 wrestlers to add on to the 42 other wrestlers to get a total of 74 wrestlers. This is by far the best wrestling game on the Gamecube but it is not the best wrestling game period. It does some things better the the Smackdown series and No Mercy but not everything which is why this game may dissapoint some people. But the bottomline is that if you want a fun wrestling game to add to your Gamecube collection then you might want to check out WWE Wrestlemania X8.

So far I have unlocked Ric Flair by winning the Europeon title and with every title you get you unlock another wreslter. (Rhyno if you win the Hardcore title, Vince McMahon win you win the Intercontinental, Chris Benoit when you win the heavyweight title, Stacey Kiebler when you win the light heavywieght, and Raven when you win the tag titles I belive but I could be wrong). However once you have unlocked the six wrestlers Path of the Champion gets old unless you want to change you title holders as they change in the WWE. There is no Women's championship because there's only about half a dozen women on the game so they must compete for the light heavyweight title. The third and maybe the best mode reliezes the idea introduced in WWF Warzone, being a virtual Vince McMahon. The Battle for the Belts has 51 different title belts each on one of the game's four different difficulty levels (easy, normal, hard, and painful,which is plenty painful). You can win these titles then change the strap color in one player but this mode shines in multiplayer since you can have unifaction matches, defend your belt against a friend, or just see who has the best create-a-wrestler. It like running your own promotion. The Create-Wrestler is the fourth mode and is no where near as detailed as it could and should of been, but it is user friendly, which is good. The game doesn't include Billy and Chuck (but who cares), Maven, Steven Richards, and the recently returned Heart Break Kid but you will find it very easy to create these missing competitors (if you really want Billy and Chuck on your game). The first thing I did on the game was to create HBK which can be done quickly and easily if you wanted to create him. The game also allows you to load off both memory cards (if you have two) like in other Nintendo wrestling games which means you can create a total of 32 wrestlers to add on to the 42 other wrestlers to get a total of 74 wrestlers. This is by far the best wrestling game on the Gamecube but it is not the best wrestling game period. It does some things better the the Smackdown series and No Mercy but not everything which is why this game may dissapoint some people. But the bottomline is that if you want a fun wrestling game to add to your Gamecube collection then you might want to check out WWE Wrestlemania X8.
This game is AWSOME! If you have never heard of the fire emblem games this is how it goes. You collect different team mates as you go through &quot;chapters&quot; (levels in the game). you then control them though these amazing areas. You then have an objective either defeating a boss, beating the intire enemy army, or claiming a throne this game is always fun yet challenging. Anywho the story plot. It is divded into 3 stories. Lyns story is first. Lyn is a sacre girl who is really related to the marquess (mayor) of a kingdom of lycia (ive frogot the name of the kingdom sorry) and she must beat her uncle before he can take the throne. Eliwoods story. He is on a quest to find his father adn descovers his father is caught up in the gang known as &quot;black fang&quot;. He must then stop a dictator that curently controls black fang. or at least thats how i interpreted it. anywho you must stop his plans of bringing the dragons back. im not gonna tell anymore or it might ruin the storyline for you. but this is an amazing game. ive played and beaten it so i should know. there are currently 7 games in the series. (1 for famicom,japans nes system, 4 for super famicom , super nintendo japan, and 1 for japan game boy advance adn this one. the game is great i would get it as soon as you can so you can expeirence the wonder of this amazing game.

As a fan of the Donkey Kong Country series I know a good edition when I find one. This is the best of the series since Donkey Kong Country 2.The only issue I have is that playing as Donkey Kong is a must. I yearn for the days when you could tag between Donkey Kong and Diddy. Since Dixie and Cranky are thrown in the mix I wish it could be done now more than ever.
A fitting end to the Donkey Kong SNES era. Was never a huge fan of Dixie or Kiddie Kong but this IS a Donkey Kong Country game so you know it's going to be awesome.

If you loved Donkey Kong Country 1 or 2 (OR BOTH!!!) then you will definately love this addition to the beloved snes Franchise! It takes what the first two have done and runs with it to make a spectacular third installment to the revered trilogy for snes! You play as Dixie Kong and Kiddy Kong! We have been introduced to Dixie Kong in the second installment but now we have Kiddy Kong! Rest assured what this toddler lacks in age he makes up for in sheer strength and size! Think of him as a toddler version of Donkey Kong! It ends the snes trilogy in a very good way! It is definately a fun and addicting addition to the beloved franchise! I highly recommend it 10/10

For those familiar with the Donkey Kong Country series, this is la creme de la creme of an outstanding series.  For everyone else, be warned: If you play this game, every other platformer will pale by comparison.For the uninitiated, you control a gorilla named Donkey Kong and his animal friends through a 2D platforming world in an effort to reclaim Donkey Kong's stolen banana hoard.  This game offers 3 Kong helpers: Diddy Kong, Dixie Kong and Cranky Kong, each with unique abilities to assist DK in his journey.  Diddy has a hover pack, which allows you to hover left and right for about 2 seconds.  Dixie Kong allows you to perform a double jump, of sorts, which allows for longer leaps.  Cranky Kong has a pogo-stick cane that allows DK to bounce upon enemies and environments (spikes, etc.) which would normally damage him.  There are also animal friends, like Rambi the Rhino, who appear in a few stages and are a blast to play.This game builds on the foundation set by Donkey Kong Country Returns.  In each stage, the letters K, O, N, and G appear on tiles that the player can grab.  If all 4 letters are grabbed in each stage within a world, a special -K stage is opened.  These special stages are VERY challenging.  After completing all of the -K stages and beating the game, the secret 7th world is opened.  This 7th world offers 3 additional rage-inducing, controller-throwing stages for those whose ego requires 100% completion.There are also puzzle pieces hidden within each stage that task the player with finding and securing them in order to reach that elusive 100% completion.  Neither the KONG letter tiles, nor the puzzle pieces are required to &#34;beat&#34; the game.  They are simply a fun addition for those who relish the challenge.As one who has played through a ton of platformers, I can say without reservation that this is easily the best one I have ever experienced.  The controls are near perfect, the challenge is high (for 100% completion), the stages are fun and varied, and the music is lively and catchy.  I give it an enthusiastic 10/10 and recommend it to all platformer fans.
Taking a page from Donkey Kong: King of Swing for the GBA, DK Jungle Climber for the DS is a simple and fun excursion starring Nintendo's resident monkey mascot, as he traverses island after island grabbing bananas in pursuit of King K. Rool.  Visually, the game looks pretty sharp as it uses the pre-rendered characters from the classic Donkey Kong Country games.  What really makes DK Jungle Climber really worth playing though is the game's control scheme which utilizes the shoulder buttons of the DS, and it works quite well, even though it may take some getting used to for some.  The levels are inventive, there's appearances aplenty from other Donkey Kong universe characters (Diddy Kong pops up now and then to lend you a hand), and there are fun mini-games as well to boot.  The only real negative aspect about DK Jungle Climber is that the cartoony aspect of it all may not win you over if you're not already a fan of the character or Nintendo's many video game icons in general, and the difficulty ranges from incredibly easy to deceptively challenging sometimes too quickly.  That aside though, DK Jungle Climber is a fun blast while it lasts, and it's definitely worth checking out for DS owners.
I loved this game it had Donkey Kong always beating on his chest and doing loud noises everytime when you make him stop, and Donkey Knog Jr. would scratch his head. In this game when one monkey gets hit in order to get your partner you have to find a barrel inside would be a monkey screeming to be let out so you grab it drow it on the ground break it then your partner comes back. I like it when you choose which person you want to use and I mean while during your playing all you do is tag team. This game has a lot of scary rides like that rollar coster or being shot out of shotting barrels while it's a snow storm. And the giant bee's you have to dodge them or hit thim with a barrel.

Collectibles, collectibles, collectibles. This game is all about collecting stuff. It's very different from past Donkey Kong games. No more are the pleasant side-scrolling levels of DK Island. This game almost feels like it should have been a Banjo-Kazooie game. A solid platformer with a killer introduction rap song keeps this game out of the fire.Fun Fact: Grant Kirkhope (the composer of Donkey Kong 64) provided the voice for Donkey Kong in this game.

Luigi is delighted to discover he has won a mansion, but is not so enthused to find out it is overrun with  ghosts who have trapped Mario somewhere inside. But the nutty Professor E. Gadd has developed a machine for capturing these creatures, which he calls the Poltergust 3000. With the aid of the Poltergust, Luigi sets off in search of his brother.Inside the mansion Luigi meets the mischievous ghosts who kidnapped his older brother. The ghost's names are cleverly suited to their occupations (the pianist is named ''Melody Pianistonio'' and the artist is called ''Vincent Van Gore'').But while the game is quality, it is a bit light on quantity. Even so, LUIGI'S MANSION is a solid, enjoyable little adventure while it lasts.

Sometimes going the 3rd party route for game accessories is an okay deal.  However, when choosing a memory card that'll save the data you worked hard for, the Memory Card should be chosen well.Comparison to 3rd Party:Many times, 3rd party brand memory cards promise much space.  For the price, they hold a large amount of game files.  Sadly, many times people lose their data.  Either they are corrupted, it refuses to recognize the card or it keeps asking to reformat the card.  The errors are more consistant, and so far I have never once had a problem with losing my data on the official Gamecube Memory Card by Nintendo.  Buy 3rd Party Memory Cards at your own risk.Comparing less memory versus 251 slots:If you are on a tight budget, (as many gamers are) buying the official Nintendo Memory Card of 59 slots may seem the best way to go.  Sure you get 59 slots, and you feel as if it'll last long enough, but it never seems to.  Sure the 59 slot memory card is roughly $5.00 less, but you are getting significanly less space.

It's about time Nintendo came out with a sizable memory unit that can hold large amount of information. Before now, one had to rely off-brand cards (such as the Nyko 8 MB) for large saves, and they were susceptible to data corruption and the loss of saves. A basic save of Madden, MVP Baseball, or any of the Sims games often took up most of a regular 251 block card. Saving more than that--a season or franchise--was only possible with off-brand cards whose record of reliability was tenuous at best. (Imagine saving a season of Madden and losing it when the card became corrupted). Nintendo-brand cards have an excellent record of stability and reliability. If you need a large card for saving sports or Sims games, this is perfect.

The Gamecube Memory Card (1019 blocks) should have come out sooner for the Gamecube. Before this, they released the 59 block and 251 block cards which had less space compared to this one. Fortunately, it works for all Gamecube games. I've had no problems with it and I hope to buy another one soon so I can backup my saves on my 251 block memory cards. If you had to choose one kind of memory card, go for the 1019 block memory card as it offers the largest amount of space from Nintendo. If you want a bigger memory card, you can look at the third party vendors. If you want quality, stick with the ones made by Nintendo.I highly recommend this memory card.

When the Gamecube was originally released back in 2001, the only data storage system available was the Memory Card 59 (besides a number of unofficial memory cards). In 2002, Nintendo finally released a large, official Memory Card 251. It is a lot better than the 59 because it has more space.

Super Mario SunshineAfter Super Mario 64 set the bar for one of Mario&#8217;s greatest game in order to keep up with Sony&#8217;s Playstation Sega&#8217;s Sega Dreamcast a sequel to Super Mario 64 had been in the works for several years; the cancelled games Super Mario 64 2 and Super Mario128 were some ideas Nintendo had for a direct sequel Super Mario 64 2 was said to be developed on the Nintendo 64DD, but ended up being canceled. For those who don&#8217;t know The Nintendo 64DD was a disk system attachment for the N64 like the Sega CD for the Sega Genesis. The first games to be released for the new system would be SimCity 64, Mario Artist, Pok&eacute;mon(Pocket Monsters) and Mother 3. There were only very limited quantities of the 64DD were made available through stores. As a result, the 64DD was only supported by Nintendo for a short period of time and only ten games were released for it. Most 64DD games were either cancelled entirely, released as normal Nintendo 64 games as cartridge-based storage sizes had increased, or eventually ported to the next-generation Nintendo GameCube console.Super Mario Sunshine has some good things but with all that said let&#8217;s begin this reviewStory/Plot: Mario sets out for Isle Delfino for a vacation with Princess Peach, and her long-time steward Toadsworth. Upon a rough plane landing at the island's airstrip, they find that the once-pristine island has been polluted and plastered with graffiti. As a result of this pollution, sun-shaped objects called &#34;Shine Sprites&#34;, the island's sources of power, have disappeared, and the island is covered in a perpetual shadow. The culprit seen spreading the graffiti is disguised as Mario, who is named &#34;Shadow Mario&#34;. To help with cleaning the airstrip, Mario finds FLUDD, a powerful water cannon which is toted like a backpack and is also created by Professor E. Gadd. Mario is promptly arrested after the player defeats a slime-covered Piranha Plant at the airstrip which makes the hole in the runway disappear and recovers a Shine Sprite, falsely accused of vandalizing the island. He is put on trial, however it turns out to be a mere kangaroo court where the judge immediately finds Mario guilty and orders him to clean up the graffiti and recover the Shine Sprites. Until then, he is forbidden from leaving the island until he does so. The next day, Mario begins his adventure to find a way to clear his name and locate the real criminal, while restoring tranquility and order to Isle Delfino. After defeating another slime-covered Piranha Plant and rising a disappeared statue out of the ground, they see Shadow Mario on top of the statue for the first time who jumps off the statue, grabs Peach, and runs off with her. Mario chases him and takes him down and he creates a graffiti portal on the restored statue and escapes through it. Mario follows him through the portal that leads to Bianco Hills, one of the other areas of Isle Delfino where he defeats another slime-covered Piranha Plant and rises a disappeared cliff, some trees, and a section of a wall out of the ground and recovers another Shine Sprite. After defeating two more slime-covered Piranha Plants and restoring the disappeared boathouse and lighthouse that unlock portals from Delfino Plaza to two of Isle Delfino's other locations, Mario follows Shadow Mario, who has kidnapped Princess Peach, and has escaped on a Bowser-designed boat to Pinna Park, an amusement park located just off the coast of Isle Delfino's &#34;tail&#34;. There, Mario defeats a huge Bowser robot being controlled by Shadow Mario which is called Mecha Bowser by firing water rockets at it on the roller coaster. It is then revealed that Shadow Mario's real identity is Bowser Jr., the youngest son of Bowser. Bowser Jr having been told by Bowser that Peach is his mother. (Mario: Peach how could you? Peach: But I don&#8217;t even reme. Mario: no physically how could you?  )  Bowser Jr wields a magic brush that creates graffiti and is also created by E. Gadd. Bowser Jr turns the remains of Mecha Bowser into a hot air balloon and escapes again with Princess Peach. When learning the truth, Peach is visually upset for a second. He is last seen heading for Corona Mountain, a volcano where Bowser is holding a family vacation of his own. After Mario continues to clean Isle Delfino, retrieving Shine Sprites, and defeats Bowser Jr., still disguised as Shadow Mario, at least once in all of the areas of the island, a flood falls upon Delfino Plaza, opening up a cave that leads into Corona Mountain that Shadow Mario disappears into. Mario enters the volcano, defeats Bowser and Bowser Jr. by flipping over the hot tub they are in and rescues the Princess. Mario and the Princess fall from the sky with Bowser and Bowser Jr. While the others are plummeting down, Princess Peach floats down to safety using her parasol. Princess Peach lands on an island beside Delfino Plaza on her feet, but on the same island, Mario gets his head stuck in the sand, but gets out. However, FLUDD becomes damaged during the battle with Bowser, supposedly beyond repair. The Shine Gate's power is restored and the Toads repair FLUDD shortly afterward and Mario, Peach and the others resume their vacation, while Bowser admits to his son that Peach was not really his mother.Okay I have minor problems with this 1. When Bowser Jr was about to take Peach to Corona Mountain why she did just jump off when she had the chance. 2. Why was Mario arrested for a crime he didn&#8217;t commit? Lastly the benefits if you didn&#8217;t get 120 shine spritesIncomplete ending After the credits, if the player has collected less than all 120 shine sprites, a picture shows Il Piantissimo, a sprinter that Mario raced during the game, finding the brush that Bowser Jr. used to vandalize Isle Delfino.Completed ending however, if the player has collected all 120 shine sprites, a picture of the entire cast with the words &#34;Have a relaxing vacation&#34; is displayed instead.So we get a freaking post card. Not as impressive as getting the 120 power stars in Super mario 64.Gameplay: Players start off in the hub world of Isle Delfino and access various worlds via portals which become available as the game progresses. Like Super Mario 64 obtaining Stars, players obtain Shine Sprites by clearing various objectives given to Mario upon entering each stage, with more objectives unlocked in each level after clearing an existing one. There are also various hidden areas and challenges across Isle Delfino where more Shine Sprites can be obtained. Throughout the game, players may also find Blue Coins, which can be exchanged for more Shine Sprites. In this game, Mario is joined by a robotic backpack named FLUDD (Flash Liquidizing Ultra Dousing Device), which uses the power of water to clean away slime and help Mario reach new places. Mario starts with two default nozzles for FLUDD, Spray and Hover, which he can quickly switch between. The Spray nozzle lets Mario squirt a stream of water which he can use to clean slime, attack enemies, and activate certain mechanisms. Meanwhile, the Hover nozzle lets Mario hover in the air for a short period of time, allowing him to cross large gaps and spray things below him. As the game progresses, Mario unlocks two additional nozzles for FLUDD which can substituted with the Hover nozzle; the Rocket nozzle, which shoots Mario high up into the air; and the Turbo nozzle, which moves Mario at high speeds, allowing him to run across water and break into certain areas. Each of FLUDD's nozzles uses water from its reserves, which can be refilled via water sources such as rivers or fountains. There are also some areas where FLUDD is taken away from Mario, forcing him to rely on his natural platforming abilities. At certain points in the game, Mario may come across an egg which hatches into a Yoshi after being brought a fruit it asks for. Yoshi can be ridden upon and can attack by spitting juice, which can clear certain obstacles that water cannot, and use its tongue to eat enemies or other pieces of fruit which can change its color. Yoshi will disappear if it runs out of juice, which can be replenished by eating more fruit, or falls into deep water.Story 4.5/5 Gameplay 4.5/5 Music 5/5 Overall 9/10 = A-

It is then revealed that Shadow Mario's real identity is Bowser Jr., the youngest son of Bowser. Bowser Jr having been told by Bowser that Peach is his mother. (Mario: Peach how could you? Peach: But I don&#8217;t even reme. Mario: no physically how could you?  )  Bowser Jr wields a magic brush that creates graffiti and is also created by E. Gadd. Bowser Jr turns the remains of Mecha Bowser into a hot air balloon and escapes again with Princess Peach. When learning the truth, Peach is visually upset for a second. He is last seen heading for Corona Mountain, a volcano where Bowser is holding a family vacation of his own. After Mario continues to clean Isle Delfino, retrieving Shine Sprites, and defeats Bowser Jr., still disguised as Shadow Mario, at least once in all of the areas of the island, a flood falls upon Delfino Plaza, opening up a cave that leads into Corona Mountain that Shadow Mario disappears into. Mario enters the volcano, defeats Bowser and Bowser Jr. by flipping over the hot tub they are in and rescues the Princess. Mario and the Princess fall from the sky with Bowser and Bowser Jr. While the others are plummeting down, Princess Peach floats down to safety using her parasol. Princess Peach lands on an island beside Delfino Plaza on her feet, but on the same island, Mario gets his head stuck in the sand, but gets out. However, FLUDD becomes damaged during the battle with Bowser, supposedly beyond repair. The Shine Gate's power is restored and the Toads repair FLUDD shortly afterward and Mario, Peach and the others resume their vacation, while Bowser admits to his son that Peach was not really his mother.Okay I have minor problems with this 1. When Bowser Jr was about to take Peach to Corona Mountain why she did just jump off when she had the chance. 2. Why was Mario arrested for a crime he didn&#8217;t commit? Lastly the benefits if you didn&#8217;t get 120 shine spritesIncomplete ending After the credits, if the player has collected less than all 120 shine sprites, a picture shows Il Piantissimo, a sprinter that Mario raced during the game, finding the brush that Bowser Jr. used to vandalize Isle Delfino.Completed ending however, if the player has collected all 120 shine sprites, a picture of the entire cast with the words &#34;Have a relaxing vacation&#34; is displayed instead.So we get a freaking post card. Not as impressive as getting the 120 power stars in Super mario 64.Gameplay: Players start off in the hub world of Isle Delfino and access various worlds via portals which become available as the game progresses. Like Super Mario 64 obtaining Stars, players obtain Shine Sprites by clearing various objectives given to Mario upon entering each stage, with more objectives unlocked in each level after clearing an existing one. There are also various hidden areas and challenges across Isle Delfino where more Shine Sprites can be obtained. Throughout the game, players may also find Blue Coins, which can be exchanged for more Shine Sprites. In this game, Mario is joined by a robotic backpack named FLUDD (Flash Liquidizing Ultra Dousing Device), which uses the power of water to clean away slime and help Mario reach new places. Mario starts with two default nozzles for FLUDD, Spray and Hover, which he can quickly switch between. The Spray nozzle lets Mario squirt a stream of water which he can use to clean slime, attack enemies, and activate certain mechanisms. Meanwhile, the Hover nozzle lets Mario hover in the air for a short period of time, allowing him to cross large gaps and spray things below him. As the game progresses, Mario unlocks two additional nozzles for FLUDD which can substituted with the Hover nozzle; the Rocket nozzle, which shoots Mario high up into the air; and the Turbo nozzle, which moves Mario at high speeds, allowing him to run across water and break into certain areas. Each of FLUDD's nozzles uses water from its reserves, which can be refilled via water sources such as rivers or fountains. There are also some areas where FLUDD is taken away from Mario, forcing him to rely on his natural platforming abilities. At certain points in the game, Mario may come across an egg which hatches into a Yoshi after being brought a fruit it asks for. Yoshi can be ridden upon and can attack by spitting juice, which can clear certain obstacles that water cannot, and use its tongue to eat enemies or other pieces of fruit which can change its color. Yoshi will disappear if it runs out of juice, which can be replenished by eating more fruit, or falls into deep water.Story 4.5/5 Gameplay 4.5/5 Music 5/5 Overall 9/10 = A-

After escaping from the clutches of 'King Boo' in LUIGI'S MANSION, Mario decides to treat himself to relaxing vacation on the beautiful 'Isle Delfino'. However, when he arrives, he is blamed for coating this rich land scape in a thick, greay sludge.  Fortunately, he finds a talking machine called FLUDD to help him clean this once gorgous island.As in the timeless classic SUPER MARIO 64, you have to unlock a number of 'alternate worlds' to beat the game. You can spend hours exploring the lush enviorments of each world, which are full of rollercoasters, tightropes, trampolines, and giant coral reefs. Mario's moves are almost unlimited: he can swim, surf, ride Yoshi (YEAH!), fight enimies (they range from mechanical Bowseres to giant squids), climb trees...and thats hardly a start. The first few levels are a little boring (they involve cleaning polloution...UGH) but the game's true charms do not become apparent until a bit later. Be patient with it, and you will be rewarded.Overall, SUPER MARIO SUNSHINE is a gem of a game that would make an excellent addition to all GC libraries. ENJOY THE RIDE!!

WWE Wrestlemania X8 is an awesome game.  It's fun and the graphics are so good.  It has very good quantities but also some not so good quantities.THE GOOD STUFF:1) The graphics and entrances look so real.2) There is no brand extension so you could choose who you want to fight on both RAW & Smackdown! Arenas.3) Unlike Wrestlemania 2000 and NO MERCY, the crowds show signs towards the wrestlers you choose.  EX, If you choose Steve Austin, you'll see the crowd hold lots of signs that say 3:16, I love Stone Cold, and Austin's favorite word "WHAT?".4) Most of the entances appear on the Titan tron, rather then the whole TV screen showing the entrances like the way Wrestlemania 2000 and NO MERCY.  But very few entances appear on the whole screen.5) Unlike the SMACKDOWN! Games, the Hell in a Cell matches are the way they should be.  It's a huge cage that covers pretty much all the fighting area in and outside the ring.  It's just the way it is in the WWE TV show.  But in the SMACKDOWN! Games, all they have are a steel cage with a top on it.6) Just like in the TV show, all the stuff that happens in the ring is shown on the Titan Tron in the backround, which makes it, look like you are really watching the WWE.7) There are many different matches to choose: Normal, hardcore, steel cage, hell in a cell, table, ladder, iron man, TLC, tag-team, Triple Threat, Fatal 4-way, battle royal, and Royal rumble matches.8) Unlike NO MERCY, tag teams that are real tag teams come out together.  Unless if you make a team up like the Rock and Kane, then they come out separately.9) Whenever you do your wrestlers signature move (EX.  Undertaker's signature moves- Last Ride and dragon sleeper) the crowd starts taking a lot of pictures just like in real life.THE BAD STUFF:1) Entrances are cut short if you choose a cage or a Hell in a Cell match.  You won't get to see the wrestlers enter the cage or cell.2) The wrestlers only have 2 different attires.  In Wrestlemania 2000 and NO MERCY you get to choose between 4 different attires.3) If it's not a hardcore match, you are only aloud 2 weapons.  In other games you can get atleast ten or so.4) Some of the entrances don't have the same music.  The NW0's music is so different from their real music.5) On the path to a champion, all you do is go from match to match.  There is no story line. Atleast NO MERCY has a story line and tells why you have to wrestle in the matches you have.6) Everything is erased unless you have a memory card.  You can't save anything on the game.As you can see I have said this game have more good things then bad things.  I always enjoy playing this game so if I were you I'd buy it.  (Note: if you get this game, you could get the Wrestlemania X Seven arena by doing a match in every arena.)

I know the game may not have much to do, but seasons are really fun and most basketball games may not have the seasons. The game is way better than most basketball games, but not as good as NBA Street. NBA Courtside 2002 has very real graphics. If you want a  realistic baskball game for GameCube, you should buy NBA Courtside 2002

I bought this game thinking it would be just like the previous THQ/WWE's N64 titles. They sure fooled me tho. The game play is definitely different from the previous versions. Altho each wrestler now has less moves than before, I find that the faster and smoother moving actions allows for a little more excitement with limited moves. Dont get me wrong here, the graphics on this game are sharp and killer and it's loads of fun to play. I just feel that THQ could have done far better than this effort. Perhaps this is almost like a trial run for them w/ wrestling games on the game cube...or perhaps they just bungled. They should have left some of the options and such from NO MERCY and WRESTLEMANIA 2000 in this game. Wrestlers have less moves, less outfit options, less taunts...there's no story lines when it comes time for the belt chasing...create a wrestler lacks a lot of different outfits, hair, faces, etc....there aren't as many moves for the wrestlers or created wrestlers. What also bothers me is that there are no interferences during matches. I rather liked that. Having a singles match and suddenly Triple H or someone comes out and tries to whip my ass. Another thing that bothers me is that wrestlers dont come out with managers or team mates. The last thing that annoys me about this game is that every little bump and hit from other wrestlers knocks you to the ground...sure it's pretty much realistic...but can be annoying; and why does the computer controlled wrestlers always gang up on me? Sure I've done a lot of bithching, but the game is still fun as all hell. It's fast, smooth...and the finisher moves were never more easier to perform. Looking at this game as if NO MERCY and WRESTLEMANIA 2000 never existed, it's killer...but we all know that those N64 titles were out there and I think that THQ should have just stuck with that style. Let's hope their next effort it a step up. This game is still fun, keeps me playing forever, and the graphics are detailed and sharp...exactly why I gave it a 4 and why I would recommend it regardless.

Kobe Bryant: NBA Courtside 2002 is an excellent basketball game for the Nintendo GameCube.  The game features a full NBA license with every team and basically every player in the league.  The game features many different game modes: Quick Play, Arcade Play, NBA Season, and a skills mode consisting of a 3 point contest and practice mode.  NBA seasons can be broken down into number of games for the season, number of games in the playoffs, minutes per quarter, trade deadline, fantasy drafts, and many many other features.  One of the best features of this game is an excellent create a player mode.  Courtside's create a player mode allows you to create a player by choosing their face, hair, height, size, and many other features all the way down to tattoos and the amount of tape on their fingers.  Once the players are created, you have an allotted amount of points to divide up between many different categories such as: defensive, dribbling, passing, dunking, shooting, 3-point shooting, stealing, and many more.  Once the players have used up their allotted point totals, you have to go into the regular game and use your newly created players and have them gain and build up more point for you to again disperse between the different categories.  This feature alone makes the replay value on this game second to none.  It is great to take your created players who are basically terrible at the start of the season and build them up into a great team.  A full license, great graphics, great player control, tons of customizing options, and a create a player system that begs to be played over and over again, makes Kobe Bryant: NBA Courtside 2002 the best basketball game available for the Nintendo GameCube and a great game to add to your GameCube Library.
