I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both H&R Block and TurboTax to compare. I found that both programs satisfied my needs but H&R Block costs consistently less. I have been buying the Deluxe version of H&R Block, before purchasing I check to see if my needs are covered by the feature set of Deluxe version. The main thing I check if the mutual funds sales and cost basis calculations are included (Schedule D) and the form for Foreign Tax Credit from mutual funds is present (Form 1116). H&R Block Deluxe version includes these forms but to get this functionality in TurboTax you need to buy the Premium version of the software.

 INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 I had no problems with my install. However last year I helped a friend resolve an install problem on a Windows 8 PC. I am including what we did in case this helps someone else. Normally the automatic install runs a file called "tcauto.exe". This file in turn calls another program located under "installers" directory which actually does the work. We were able to by-pass the error my executing the exe program in the installers directory directly "HRBlock_Deluxe+Efile+State_2014_CD.exe" (it is the only file in that directory).

 If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

 If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you dowload it. The key-code can be located two ways.
Option 1: After my download finished the install started automatically offering me a choice of two links "View Keys" and "Install".
Option 2: You can locate it in your Amazon account:
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

 Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs?
I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic "Installing Software on Another Computer"
I quote the FAQ answer below:
"There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.
Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer.
Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.
The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, "Can I install the software on a second computer?"
Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate.
You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation."

 WHAT IS INCLUDED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This H&R Block Deluxe includes only the federal tax return (no State).  This version entitles a person to 5 free federal e-files.  The program allows to print any number of returns without limits, and if you decide to mail returns (instead of e-filing) there no additional fees.

 GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until mid January of 2015.

 Pet Peeve: H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version. That would have been useful.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations. Last year I had to do both and I found the guidance in Deluxe package was sufficient to complete the forms.

 Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on "learn more" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.

 H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

 DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC. You no longer need to enter this information on H&R web site. I prefer having this information locally on my PC for better security. It suggests reasonable prices based on condition of the donated item and it is nice not to have to come with what is reasonable on my own.

 Pet Peeve: I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

 I usually purchase tax software as early as possible to help me with end year tax planning. However, if timing is not important to you be aware that the price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter "Amazon price history alert" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word camel in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached. During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $44.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.

 At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

 Sometimes I want to return to some section of my return. The best way to jump to any section directly without navigating through other pages is to use "take me to" button which is displayed at the top of every page, on the same line as H&R Block banner.

 Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?
Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.

 Problem alert 
There is a bug importing TT 2013 data when using XP.  There is a lengthy discussion on this topic in H&R support forum including a post from H&R Support that they aware of the issue and working on it.
Amazon does not allow to post URL links in the text of the review, so I am posting a link to the discussion as a comment.

 Adding this point based on a useful question in the comments:  The final tax return can be saved in a .PDF format for future reference.

 Updated 2/25/15. You might have noticed that front page states that the next update is March 12, 2015. Someone asked me about this rather late update and I was able to find what portion of the return is effected by the update by searching the H&R support forum: This update is related to "The Health Insurance Coverage" with "The Marketplace Health Insurance" for participants that are 65 or older.

 What to do if my social security number was used by a thief?

During the last year there were many different data breaches and some people's social security numbers have been stolen.  It appears that some thieves filed returns using the stolen social security numbers.  If this happens the person who tries to file a return will get the following error:

IRS records show the spouse's Social Security number (SSN) on this return is the same as the primary taxpayer's SSN on another return already filed this year. Double-check your spouse's SSN. Fix any issues and e-file again. Otherwise, you'll have to file a paper return.

What to do if this happens?
1. Call HRB told them of the issue (1-800-472-5625)
2. Call IRS (1-800-829-1040) had them flag the SS#
IRS states that people need to mail completed return, a copy of police report or Form 14039 Identity Theft Affidavit http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f14039.pdf, copy of Drivers License or passport or SS card.

3. Call Equifax and have them put an alert on the SS# (They notify Experian and TransUnion as well)
4. Call Social Security Administration and notify them (1-800-772-1213)
5. File with FTC https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/Information#crnt&panel1-1
6. File a police report of a possible identity theft


I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. I keep coming back because it works well for the tax forms I need to do and it is less expensive than TurboTax. If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.

I purchased H&R Block Deluxe plus State. This version entitles me to 5 free federal e-files. It allows me to print and mail as many returns as I want, there is no limit on printing.

One state software is included in the package but the package does NOT include free e-file for the state return (see one exception below). If you want to e-file your state return you will need to pay a fee of $19.95 to e-file each state return. Alternatively, you can print all the forms and mail them using US post office without any additional fees. If you need to file taxes for an additional state, each additional state is $39.95 plus $19.95 e-file fee.

Note: NY state residents can e-file state returns for free.

 For folks trying to download State Forms. The state forms are not available as of 11/30/2014. You have an option of entering email where you will be notified as soon as the form for your state becomes available. Alternatively, you can go to H&R website, hover (do not click) "Download Software" on the top banner and select "State Editions". Currently it says "Please check back in mid January 2015".

When the state forms became available and I clicked to start the download the entire program disappears for about a minute (I thought it crashed), but then the download screen appeared and the program continued normally.

 At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

Ali Julia review
I just finished my preliminary tax return and happy to report that I have not encountered any problems. Overall, the interface looks very similar to last year.  I purchased the H&R Deluxe + State, but the Federal portion is identical, so I am reposting the Federal portion of the review for reference here.

I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both H&R Block and TurboTax to compare. I found that both programs satisfied my needs but H&R Block costs consistently less. I have been buying the Deluxe version of H&R Block because it covers it the mutual funds sales and cost basis calculations are included (Schedule D) and the form for Foreign Tax Credit from mutual funds is present (Form 1116). To get this functionality in TurboTax you need to buy the Premium version of the software.

The price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter "Amazon price history alert" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word "camel" (repeated 3 times) in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached. During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $34.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.

' INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
' I had no problems with my install. However in 2013 I helped a friend resolve an install problem on a Windows 8 PC us installing from a CD. I am including what we did again as I know a few people told me in helped with 2014 install. Normally the automatic install runs a file called "tcauto.exe". This file in turn calls another program located under "installers" directory which actually does the work. We were able to by-pass the error by executing the exe program in the installers directory directly, this year it should be called "HR_Block_Tax_Software_2015_Deluxe__State_-_Windows_CD.exe" (it is the only file in that directory).

' If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

' If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you download it. The key-code can be located several ways.
Option 1: In the past when my download finished the install started automatically and offered me a choice of two links "View Keys" and "Install".
Option 2: This year the install did not start automatically so I clicked on the install program myself, and on the first screen it asked for "Activation code". When I purchased the software Amazon sent me a message which included a Product Code (note that they did not call it Activation code) which is the number I needed.
Option 3: You can locate it in your Amazon account:
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

' If you have a virus scanner it will generate an alert the first time you run the program, change the permission to "Permit Always" otherwise the program will be blocked.

' Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs?
I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic "Installing Software on Another Computer"
I quote the FAQ answer below:
"There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.
Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer.
Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.
The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, "Can I install the software on a second computer?"
Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate.
You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation."

' WHAT IS INCLUDED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I purchased H&R Block Deluxe entitles me to 5 free federal e-files. It allows me to print and mail as many returns as I want, there is no limit on printed returns.

' GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until mid January of 2016.

' Pet Peeve: H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version. That would have been useful.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations.

' Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on "learn more" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.

' H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

' DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC. It suggests reasonable prices based on condition of the donated item and it is nice not to have to come up with what is reasonable on my own.

' Pet Peeve: I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

' At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

' Sometimes I want to return to some section of my return. The best way to jump to any section directly without navigating through other pages is to use "take me to" button which is displayed at the top of every page, on the same line as H&R Block banner.

' Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?
Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.

' The final tax return can be saved in a .PDF format for future reference.

'  In 2014 TurboTax's introduced a requirement that the data had to be sent to Intuit's servers to be formatted for printing. I verified that H&R Block can print forms when Ethernet connection is disconnected.

'  If you owe taxes there are three options for payment: electronic withdrawal from your bank, mailing a check and paying by credit card from a secure web site. Is there a charge to pay by credit card? Yes. There are three web sites that do this service and the fees vary from the lowest of $2.50 flat fee for a debit card to highest of 2.25% fee by credit card from one of the web sites.  If you search for "pay taxes by credit or debit" you will see the detailed fee schedule on the irs.gov web site.

' IDENTIFY THEFT AND TAX RETURNS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
' Last year there were many reports of thieves filing fraudulent tax returns using stolen social security numbers
If this happens the person who tries to file their own tax return gets the following error:

IRS records show the spouse's Social Security number (SSN) on this return is the same as the primary taxpayer's SSN on another return already filed this year. Double-check your spouse's SSN. Fix any issues and e-file again. Otherwise, you'll have to file a paper return.

What to do if this happens?
1. Call HRB told them of the issue (1-800-472-5625)
2. Call IRS (1-800-829-1040) had them flag the SS#
IRS states that people need to mail completed return, a copy of police report or Form 14039 Identity Theft Affidavit (...), copy of Drivers License or passport or SS card.
3. Call Equifax and have them put an alert on the SS# (They notify Experian and TransUnion as well)
4. Call Social Security Administration and notify them (1-800-772-1213)
5. File with FTC (...)
6. File a police report of a possible identity theft

I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. I keep coming back because it works well for the tax forms I need to do and it is less expensive than TurboTax. If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.

Ali Julia review
I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both TaxCut and TurboTax to compare. I found that TurboTax did not do anything better than TaxCut while costing consistently more.

I purchased a digital download version of H&R Block Deluxe plus State. The Federal portion of these two packages is identical, so I am cross posting my review of the Federal portion of the software for both packages .

H&R Block Deluxe entitles you to 5 free federal e-files. You can print and mail as many returns as you want, there is no limit on printing.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations. Last year I had to do both and I found the guidance in Deluxe package was sufficient to complete the forms.

 DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC. You no longer need to enter this information on H&R web site. I prefer having this information locally on my PC for better security. The change from web site to local PC was introduced last year and I was happy to see that this change is here to stay.

 I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

 I use large font option on my monitor display and in the past years had display issues on some forms (text boxes were display overlapping each other on some forms). This year all forms displayed properly.

 I usually purchase tax software as early as possible to help me with end year tax planning.

I found that TurboTax did not do anything better than TaxCut while costing consistently more. In addition, I like the option of being able to file 5 free Federal e-files as I do taxes for other relatives who are less computer savvy.

If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

I just finished a preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until January 10, 2013.
Note that I purchased H&R Block Deluxe plus State, and in this review I am including only the review of the federal forms. The federal forms part of the product are identical, of course, whether one buys the State add-on or not.

1. H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary.
It would have better if they waited until the financial information is entered and offered the Premium version only to those for whom it might make sense.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividents, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations. This year I had to do both, and I found the guidance to be sufficient to complete the forms.

2. As of 11/19/2012 videos for tax law changes were not available yet (the prompt said coming soon).

3. Minor pet peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on "learn more" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which words to use locate the relevant topics.

4. Good news: DeductionPro 2012 is now integrated into H&R Block, you no longer need to go to H&R web site.

5. H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example from mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

6. Copy and Paste from Interview screens is not possible. Sometimes I wish to do it for some issue as a reminder to myself. My solution is to do PrintScreen (holding ctl key, shift key, and PrintScreen key at the same time). This generates an image of the screen, which I paste into paint or photo editing software which I can print or save for later.

7. I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

8. I use large font option on my monitor display and in the past had display issues (some things were displayed on top of each other). This year all forms displayed properly with this option. Nice!

9. H&R Block Deluxe entitles you to 5 free federal state e-files.

10. The price on this package changes day to day. I found a nice tools that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter "price history alert" in Google it will come up at the top, it has the word camel in the name. I find this tool very helpful. I just looked up that the price last year during the tax preparation season hit the $20 mark on three different dates. You can set up an alert tool to email you when your desired price has been reached.

11. A note about digital download key-code
-----------------------------------------
I run into a glitch a solution to which I want to include

After I installed the software and started it for the first time it prompted me to enter a key-code. The prompt said that I should have received in the email after purchasing the software, however the email I received from Amazon did not contained a key-code. I had to call Amazon support and they told me that this information can be found following these steps
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

12. Update 12/10/2012.  I received a question if H&R allows to install the software on two PCs.  I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic "Installing Software on Another Computer"

 There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.
  Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer.
  Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.
  The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, "Can I install the software on a second computer?"
  Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate.
  You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail.
  Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

13. Update 12/18/2012.  Adding another answer to great question to share with everyone.
Q:  Is there an audit check which marks problems with red flags?
A:  At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags , and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

14. Update 2/7/2013. I received a question if I had any problem doing updates of the software.
I have performed several updates without problems.  If you have a firewall, the firewall prompts with a question if you trust the software and you need to reply "yes". If you say no, the install will be rolled back.  If you accidentally reply "No" to this prompt, I would recommend uninstalling the software. Then installing it again, and then trying another update.  Alternatively you can deactivate the firewall during the install.

I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. The interview process is helpful in reminding you things you might have forgotten. 2012 H&R Block package addressed a couple of my old pet peeves (for example, integration with DeductionPro). So I am quite pleased with it and recommend it!

 WHAT IS INCLUDED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I purchased a digital download version of H&R Block Deluxe plus State. This version entitles you to 5 free federal e-files.  You can print and mail as many returns as you want, there is no limit on printing.

One state software is included in the package but the package does NOT include free e-file for the state return (see one exception below). If you want to e-file  your state return you will need to pay a fee of $19.95 to e-file each state return. Alternatively, you can print all the forms and mail them using US post office.  If you need to file taxes for an additional state, each additional state is $39.95 plus $19.95 e-file fee.  Ouch!

Note: NY state residents can e-file state returns for free.

 GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until January 9, 2014.

 H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version.  That would have been useful.

The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

 For folks trying to download State Forms. The state forms are not available as of 11/17/2013. You have an option of entering email where you will be notified as soon as the form for your state becomes available. Alternatively, you can go to H&R website, click on "Download Software" on the top banner, and select "State Editions".  Currently it says "Available in January 2014".

When the state forms will become available they can be downloaded by selecting the State Tab and then clicking on the button labelled "Buy" (a little scary since we already paid for it) but then "buy" will turn into "update" and the forms will be downloaded to your computer.

 At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

To get this functionality in TurboTax you need to buy the Premium version of the software.

The price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter "Amazon price history alert" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word "camel" (repeated 3 times) in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached. During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $44.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.

' INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
' I had no problems with my install. However in 2013 I helped a friend resolve an install problem on a Windows 8 PC us installing from a CD. I am including what we did again as I know a few people told me in helped with 2014 install. Normally the automatic install runs a file called "tcauto.exe". This file in turn calls another program located under "installers" directory which actually does the work. We were able to by-pass the error by executing the exe program in the installers directory directly, this year it should be called "HR_Block_Tax_Software_2015_Deluxe__State_-_Windows_CD.exe" (it is the only file in that directory).

' If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

' If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you dowload it. The key-code can be located several ways.
Option 1:  In the past when my download finished the install started automatically and offered me a choice of two links "View Keys" and "Install".
Option 2:  This year the install did not start automatically so I clicked on the install program myself, and on the first screen it asked for "Activation code".  When I purchased the software Amazon sent me a message which included a Product Code (note that they did not call it Activation code) which is the number I needed.
Option 3: You can locate it in your Amazon account:
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

' If you have a virus scanner it will generate an alert the first time you run the program, change the permission to "Permin Always" otherwise the program will be blocked.

' Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs?
I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic "Installing Software on Another Computer"
I quote the FAQ answer below:
"There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.
Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer.
Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.
The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, "Can I install the software on a second computer?"
Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate.
You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation."

' WHAT IS INCLUDED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I purchased H&R Block Deluxe plus State. This version entitles me to 5 free federal e-files. It allows me to print and mail as many returns as I want, there is no limit on printed returns.

One state software is included in the package but the package does NOT include free e-file for the state return (see one exception below). If you want to e-file your state return you will need to pay a fee of $19.95 to e-file each state return. Alternatively, you can print all the forms and mail them using US post office without any additional fees. If you need to file taxes for an additional state, each additional state is $39.95 plus $19.95 e-file fee.

Note 1: NY state residents can e-file state returns for free if their income is $60,000 or less.
Note 2: It is not possible to e-file a state return for New Hampshire, it has to be mailed in.

' GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until mid January of 2016.

' Pet Peeve: H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version. That would have been useful.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations.

' Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on "learn more" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.

' H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

' DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC.  It suggests reasonable prices based on condition of the donated item and it is nice not to have to come up with what is reasonable on my own.

' Pet Peeve: I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

' For folks trying to download State Forms. The state forms are not available as of 11/20/2015. H&R web site says they will become available in January.  To see the latest status you can go to H&R website, click on Dowload software, then hover over  "Download Software" on the top banner and select "State Editions". Currently it says "Coming soon in January 2016".

When the state forms became available and  teh state software can be downloaded directly from the program.

' At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

' Sometimes I want to return to some section of my return. The best way to jump to any section directly without navigating through other pages is to use "take me to" button which is displayed at the top of every page, on the same line as H&R Block banner.

' Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?
Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.

' The final tax return can be saved in a .PDF format for future reference.

'  In 2014 TurboTax's introduced a requirement that the data had to be sent to Intuit's servers to be formatted for printing. I verified that H&R Block can print forms when Ethernet connection is disconnected.

'  If you owe taxes there are three options for payment: electronic withdrawal from your bank, mailing a check and paying by credit card from a secure web site. Is there a charge to pay by credit card? Yes. There are three web sites that do this service and the fees vary from the lowest of $2.50 flat fee for a debit card to highest of 2.25% fee by credit card from one of the web sites.  If you search for "pay taxes by credit or debit" you will see the detailed fee schedule on the irs.gov web site.

' IDENTIFY THEFT AND TAX RETURNS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
'  Last year there were many reports of thieves filing fraudulent tax returns using stolen social security numbers
If this happens the person who tries to file their own  tax return gets the following error:

IRS records show the spouse's Social Security number (SSN) on this return is the same as the primary taxpayer's SSN on another return already filed this year. Double-check your spouse's SSN. Fix any issues and e-file again. Otherwise, you'll have to file a paper return.

What to do if this happens?
1. Call HRB told them of the issue (1-800-472-5625)
2. Call IRS (1-800-829-1040) had them flag the SS#
IRS states that people need to mail completed return, a copy of police report or Form 14039 Identity Theft Affidavit (...) copy of Drivers License or passport or SS card.
3. Call Equifax and have them put an alert on the SS# (They notify Experian and TransUnion as well)
4. Call Social Security Administration and notify them (1-800-772-1213)
5. File with FTC (...)
6. File a police report of a possible identity theft

I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. I keep coming back because it works well for the tax forms I need to do and it is less expensive than TurboTax. If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.

Ali Julia review
I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both TaxCut and TurboTax to compare. I found that TurboTax did not do anything better than TaxCut while costing consistently more. In addition, I like the option of being able to file 5 free Federal e-files as I do taxes for other relatives who are less computer savvy.  The files with the return are recognized by both Windows PC and Mac.  The data can be imported from a return made on PC computer by copying the files to the Mac and then importing them.

H&R Block software also wins if compared to the free on-line options. I don't like using the on-line tax programs for two reasons (1) I don't want my financial data to be on someone's web site (2) free offers include the Federal tax only.

This year I used a digital download for the first time rather than a boxed version. I liked the security of having a physical CD in case I need to re-install on another computer several years down the road. But you are supposed to be able to download the software again to a different computer and when the boxed version was not available I went digital.

Downloading the software was easy, however during the install I got an error registering the software.  When I started the software it immediately gave me a prompt to enter a key-code which (the prompt said) I should have received in the email after purchasing the software.  The email I received from Amazon contained no such key-code.  I had to call Amazon support and they told me that this information can be found following these steps
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

Once this was done the rest of the software functions well. In fact it looked more polished than in prior years. I always had minor display problems because I use large fonts and they never scaled quite right.  This year everything displayed perfectly.

I read one review which mentioned a problem with seeing selection boxes.  The problem there most likely caused by low screen resolution.  Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher.  At a lower resolution, there will be problem with display such as not seeing selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

I did a preliminary tax return and below are my observations.

1. H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary.

2. Copy and Paste from Interview screens is not possible. Sometimes I wish to do it for some issue as a reminder to myself. My solution is to do PrintScreen (holding ctl key, shift key, and PrintScreen key at the same time). This generates an image of the screen, which I paste into paint or photo editing software which I can print or save for later.

3. I don't use the default location for the tax returns, as I want to my backup program to back up only the data not the software itself. The software does not  initially remember this new location on startup, it tells me I have no returns.  I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it does remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

4. Some forms (such as foreign tax credit over the limit to be directly on 1040) require entering data manually.  This year the foreign tax credit form is some what automated, when you hit next button it takes you to the next place on the form you need to fill out (last your you were just presented the form to fill out on your own). This form is not that hard to do manually as this form does not change year to year.

5. I use large font option on my monitor display and in the past had display issues (some things were displayed on top of each other). This year all forms displayed properly with this option. This is the first time in all the years I've used H&R Block software that I have no complaint about the display and did not need to change my monitor settings just to do the tax preparation. Nice!

6. H&R Block charges $19.95 to e-file each state return. Of course, this charge can be avoided by printing the forms and mailing them in.

7. In prior years the package include DeductionPro software. This year, like last year, this software is only available as an online tool. I will not use software that requires me to put my financial data on their site, and DeductionPro wants to import the data to H&R web site, so I will not be using it. Disappointing.

8. The price on this package changes day to day. I found a nice tools that shows history of Amazon prices and allows you to generate an email alert when the price reaches our desired price range.  If you enter "price history alert" in Google it will come up at the top, it has the word camel in the name.  I find this tool very helpful.  I purchased this package for $31, last year I saw the prices fluctuate between $25 and the list price of $44.99.

9.  For folks trying to download State Forms before January 16, 2012. The state forms are not available for download until January 16 for most states.
If you go to the Software Update Center on H&R website you will see a section called State Updates. Under there you there is a link called "Forms Available". If you click on that, it will show a table that shows availability of forms for each State.  Right now (last checked on 1/6/2011) none of them are available.  I called about my state (Massachusetts) and they told me that most state forms will become available for download on January 16. In the software package, select State Tab and click the button that is called "Buy"  (a little scary since we already paid for it) but then "buy"  will turn into "update" and when the forms will become available they will be downloaded to your computer.

10. ** ERROR ALERT ** 1/16/12 Version of Massachusetts state return contained an error that was corrected in 1/24/12 update.
If you owed taxes on your 2010 State return and paid owed tax in 2011, this payment was incorrectly included in Line 36 on the MA Form 1 as an amount withheld in 2011. This overstates the amount paid to the State for the 2011 tax year. This error has been reported to H&R and corrected in 1/24/12 update.

I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. The interview process is helpful in reminding you things you might have forgotten. On-line help is useful.  2011 H&R Block package appears more polished and has a number of improvements to a couple of small pet peeves I had in the past.  So I am quite pleased with it and recommend it!

After Turbo Tax Deluxe pulled their little stunt this year I knew it was time to switch tax software packages. Before this I had used Turbo Tax Deluxe for many many years. I can honestly say that H&R Block Deluxe worked just as good as Turbo Tax Deluxe ever did. And H&R Block Deluxe is less expensive than Turbo Tax Deluxe. And after Intuits little stunt this year the price difference is even greater. I am now a loyal H&R Block Deluxe user. And a happy one at that. Thank you H&R Block. I hope you had many new customers this year. You deserve it! Thank you.
I have been a loyal user of Turbo Tax Deluxe since the mid 1990's. That is, until now. With Turbo Tax pulling their "Greed is Good" ploy, by stripping out the guts of a product that they then sold to their loyal customers at the same or higher prices; I decided that they didn't appreciate my loyalty or continued use of their product.
I purchased H&R Block Deluxe and am very pleased with the seamless incorporation of my past Turbo Tax files into their platform. It was very pleasing to have the program run without a hitch. Also, it was half the price of the Turbo Tax program that I have previously used. So long INTUIT and your Turbo Tax disaster. My change of tax program was further appreciated when the latest news story of the Turbo Tax internet leak was plastered all over the news. I don't like to attract attention by voicing negative opinions concerning what people use or prefer. However, this vindictive move by Turbo Tax to destroy their goodwill with their loyal users has crossed the line of greedy self interest.
H&R Block will continue to keep my loyalty from now on.............OR, until they decide to shoot themselves in the foot and try to disrespect their customer base by bending them over and giving them a dry one, just as INTUIT and Turbo Tax has done. Eyes open....no fear!
Bought Tax Cut because Turbo Tax tried sticking it to their former loyal consumer base.  After receiving Tax Cut, Turbo Tax reversed their decision, too late for this year and possibly for futures years also.  Tax Cut was efficient cost less and hopefully won't try stick it to the consumers that tried them the way Turbo did.  I also use Inuit's Quicken, their gaff with Turbo Tax is making me rethink whether I'll stick with it when it's time to Update.
Easy to download to my MAC.  Transferred Turbo Tax files with ease and costs less than Turbo Tax.  Have been a Turbo Tax user for 18 years and their prices keep rising and in 2014 their Deluxe version no longer contains Schedules C and D.  HYR Block Deluxe has them and the conversion has been flawless.  Sorry, Turbo T, your greed lost you a long time customer.  Thank you H&R for making it easy and more cost effective.
I used turbo tax for years, which I ditched when they redid their software for 2014 tax year trying to ream their customers.  I jumped to H&R block.  I had a number of unusual tax issues (change in jobs, two states, two houses, royalties, etc.) and H&R Block handled everything very smoothly.  It imported my turbo tax data without a hitch.  I purchased the 2015 version, as I have no plan on going back to Intuit's Turbo Tax.  After the stunt they pulled, I'm not going back.  Why should I.  H&R block offers everything they do at half the price!
Thankfully, I was able to heed the advice of many former Turbo Tax users and purchase Tax Cut right off the bat.
Tax Cut works wonderfully, and I experienced no problems in installing or using the problems.  A very seamless operation, indeed.
To those who are skittish about switching to Tax Cut (i.e. afraid of change or the unknown) let me assure you, Tax Cut works just as well as Turbo Tax, but without the added problems of installation and operation.  I say this, as a former Turbo Tax user from way back when it was part of Parsons Technology.
I give Tax Cut a big Five Stars!  And the Turbo Tax people need to take notice here.  In fact, I think it's the whole Intuit culture that needs to be changed, when they try to foister outrageous things upon their users (Intuit QuickBooks users:  remember when they forced you to 'subscribe' to the payroll tax tables and gave you no choice otherwise?).

As a 15 year user of Turbo Tax Basic, I came to Amazon for my yearly TT download.  However, I immediately noticed TT had a "1-star" rating this year, whereas it was always rated 5 stars in the past.  In reading the TT reviews, I realized TT was basically now selling last year's free (1040EZ and 1040A) software under the "Basic" name.  Anyone, like me, who bought the "Basic" version for the schedules (A, B, C, etc.) and forms was getting pushed to the Premier version selling for close to $50.  Just another corporate money grab. Yes, I read that TT tried to recant their bad decision by providing the schedules and forms...but guess what TT....too late.

I was initially apprehensive about having to learn a new (H&R Block) tax software program, but I found the H&R software easier to use than TT.
It is extremely easy to use, very accurate, and has all the schedules and forms I need.
Now that my taxes are complete, I have decided to stick with this H&R Block software until they (hopefully never) pull a TT scam.

In closing, if you are like me (and others) whom have used Turbo Tax Basic (the real one), I can assure you will not be disappointed in changing to H&R Block Tax software.
Thank you.
Long time Turbo Tax user, first time H&R Block customer. While I have prepared my taxes myself for many years, I have been using a tax accountant to prepare them for the last several years. I decided to once again go back to preparing my own. Being a longtime Turbo Tax user, they were my first go to. After seeing all the negative publicity regarding the changes they have made to what is included in which version, I decided to research a bit more.

Long story short, I have decided to give H&R Block a try. Cost was a good bit less than a comparable version of Turbo Tax. After using their software for a bit now, I have actually come to prefer it over the previous versions of Turbo Tax I had been using. While I would likely recommend Turbo Tax to a first time user, not so with someone who actually has a little bit of a clue as to what they are doing. The H&R Block could certainly be used by a newcomer, but I think the layout of Turbo Tax is a bit more geared towards them. I will likely continue using H&R Block in the future!
Converted after 15 years of using TurboTax Deluxe.  I read all the reviews about Intuit's latest round of de-featuring Turbo Tax 2014 and decided to give something else a try.  So far, so good.  The software installed seamlessly, and imported my 2013 TurboTax file with no problems whatsoever.  Intuit's arrogance with regard to pricing their products has cost them another customer.  Based on Intuit's behavior with regard to pricing not only TurboTax but also their Quickbooks/Payroll products, its clear to me that they have enough customers already and do not have any need to retain my business.

OK I'm another long-time (6 years) TurboTax user that switched to Taxcut. I finished filing my returns yesterday. After reading the reviews for both TurboTax and Taxcut, I almost did my taxes by hand. As it turns out, for me at least, some of the more the ominous Taxcut feedback (the ones with single stars) was mostly hype.
My return is moderately complex, with regular and passive income, capital gains, itemized deductions, carryover losses etc. At the end of the day, Taxcut handled it all fine. Here are some positives that address some of the negative feedback:
1. Imported last year's TurboTax data perfectly. There was one minor glitch in interpreting it, which I'll explain below.
2. Performed two online updates via dialup, one via LAN, they all worked fine
3. Properly handled the carryover loss, which had to be treated differently for Fed and State
4. Interview worked fine - never ran into a question like "please fill in form X"
5. Navigation through fields worked fine with the Tab key and arrows
6. E-filing worked great. Yeah the return got rejected a couple of times because Taxcut didn't ask me to fill in fields that the IRS and FTB wanted, but the error status pointed me right to the problems and I fixed them easily, and re-filed. Never crashed, no "socket warnings", etc. I e-filed via dialup.
The only thing I can think of that might make a difference is alot of people seem to be using the XP OS. I'm using Win 98, and Win 2000. Maybe Taxcut has issues with XP.

Taxcut did what TurboTax made harder this year - I completed the return on my home PC and loaded Taxcut on my work PC only to print it out.
Here are a couple of negatives:
1. The program crashed about 5 or 6 times while completing my return, mostly when I was bouncing around between different sections. While annoying, I never lost data, in fact Taxcut seems to retain data even if you don't save the file manually.
2. When you e-file, you use your last year's AGI as an electronic signature. Taxcut pulled the wrong figure (gross income vs. AGI) from my TurboTax data. I was able to override the field and it worked fine. My return was still rejected because my spouse's AGI didn't match, even though I filed MFJ last year! Taxcut doesn't allow you to specify spouse's AGI in that case, so I had to fake it out and go through as though it was filed separately, override the spouse AGI, and then go back and change the filing status. For some reason, even though the status is MFJ, Taxcut provides a spouse AGI and the IRS checks it. Minor annoyance.
Overall I like Taxcut and would use it again. I also liked TurboTax alot. Not sure what I'm going to do next year. Either program beats doing taxes by hand by a mile.

I remember the bad old days with columns of figures on paper, stacks of receipts, files full of records, a calculator, and a "working 1040 form". I'd come across a missed receipt and erase and change numbers on two different forms and three different pages. It was hard work and took a very long time.

This program makes that process easy. Find an extra $40 receipt? Add $40 to one place and all the things that need to change update through your return.

But the real strength are the wizards that take you through more complicated deductions. Rather than reading lots of instructions for line after line, this software asks you for the correct set of numbers, you supply them ... done.

For me, it shortened a two day process down to two hours.

Highly recommended.
TaxCut is well worth the price if you don't have a "simple return" (i.e. just income from one job, maybe a couple of bank accounts, no stock trading, capital gains, etc.)  If you have a simple return, just download the fill-in PDF forms from the IRS and get after it.  But if you have itemizing, income from more than just employment and a bank account or two, then this is worth the time you'll save.  You can find everything you need to know in the IRS instructions and forms, but the $30-$40 will save you hours of time in looking it up, thru TaxCut's interview process.

A couple of notes, however:

a)  I think that the state tax forms sort of stink -at least for Louisiana.  Instead of outputting the same form that you get from the state (as TaxCut does for the Fed form), it prints out a summarized one, with all the data in one big block, no x-refs, etc.  So you find manually checking it almost impossible.

b) The web-based tools that supposedly are one of the features of TaxCut have never worked for me when I needed them.  Maybe if you wait until March or April to use them, but for those of us that file early, the stuff just hasn't worked.  I rate the web-based and planning tools at a near zero

c) e-mail support hasn't impressed me.  But then, for the filing of your taxes, you really shouldn't need it.  The interview process and built-in help files are generally sufficient.  Still, when I tried to use the web-based features, and they failed to work, I got some "canned" responses from the support group that obviously indicated that they 1- did not know what I was talking about, 2-they were using a standard set of FAQs that really didn't answer my questions/concerns, and 3-they really didn't care.  However, as noted, if it works to start with, that's better than problems requiring support, regardless of how good/bad the support is.

d) MOST IMPORTANT-  You MUST keep your software from year to year.  DON'T discard the CD or dnload prior to 5 yr after filing. Reason- except for transferring your personal data as a prelude to entering current year data, you cannot open past year TaxCut tax return files (or at least thru 2006 tax yr) with the current software.  So if you need to make an amended return, or if you're audited for say, a 3 yr old return, you'd better have a printed or PDF copy if you don't still have the sftware.  I think that's pretty poor (not being able to open previous yr's tax return files), but maybe if enough of us complain, a change will occur.  You can, however, output to a PDF and save that file for future ref.  (You won't be able to amend with the PDF however.)

But, for under $40, the time saved for anything but a simple return, it's well worth it.  (not to mention the saved time in doing "what-ifs" for various filing options.)

buy it every year and it transfers my data from year to year, smoothly and quickly.  Would have rated 5, but help isn't as helpful as we'd like. Finally had to contact the 'live help' and after several minutes of chatting back and forth and answering questions from the rep, was told that they aren't able to answer that type of question ... which they should have just told us when we first asked the question at the beginning of the chat session.  Otherwise, the interview is pretty quick and easy ... just don't try and fill in any of the forms yourself or it seems to mess everything up.  :)
I just began my tax return, got to the end with no errors reported; then the audit risk calculation returns back with a page stating that it found a "slightly elevated audit risk due to 1 of the following reasons"; it went on to list a handful of reasons, none of which even remotely applied to me. So either the evaluation is incorrect, or the reasons listed are.

I called HR Block support, which led me to a tech support person who was completely clueless as to what I was trying to tell her; instead she kept insisting that I must have entered bad data, because that must be the reason behind any problem: user error!

After trying to explain the situation several times, I finally told her that I am a software programmer with years of experience who knows a bug when she sees one, and all I was trying to do is to (1) report the bug and (2) hope to find out whether or not I really have an audit risk.

Ultimately the only help she could provide was to give me the telephone number of the local HR Block office, which was much more helpful;

However, either way, neither person was able to report this bug on my behalf, (and I could find no link on their web site) which leads me to wonder how any software error can get fixed.  And I have a relatively simple return!

Something else I learned, that was rather disturbing, at least according to that  tech support: HR Block has all the information I've entered into the desktop software already on their servers even though I haven't filed anything yet. I would love to know whether this is True. What if I chose to file by paper? in which case there is no reason for them to have my financial data.
This is the 3rd year I used h&r block software. Downloaded easily without any issues or problems at all.  I was concerned about that since my computer is older now. Only issue I had was with the IRA deduction. I brought it to a h&r block assistant available while I was using the software. Problem occurred when I changed my response from yes to no in regards to a IRA. 1st case I said yes to the IRA and then entered the amount in the next screen. Then I went back and said no to the IRA... The program kept the amount as the deduction. I couldn't remove the deducted amount. I asked for online assistance.  He didn't know how to remove the amount either. I figured it out myself while I was online with the assistant, you have to say yes to the IRA and then the next screen appears and you can change the amount, which in this case was zero.  I brought it to their attention and hopefully they fix it next year. It also didn't appear as an error issue in the end. That was disturbing since I said no to the IRA but the amount still appeared as a deduction in the end..so a heads up.
Update: The Etrade data import problem referenced below was fixed.  So, the software functioned well: 1). imported last years TurboTax data; 2). imported Etrade, Schwab, and Fidelity transaction info completely and without errors; 3). WI and MI state filings completed without problems. 4). E-filed federa without problems; 5). printing and archiving worked fine.

I am a long-time TurboTax user who switched to HRB this year.  So far, the aforementioned programs are substantially equivalent in their functionality.

But, anyone who is trying to populate their Schedule D by importing transaction information from Etrade will likely be peeved.

Importing data from Fidelity and Schwab worked perfectly, that is, complete and with no errors.

However, I tried dozens of times to import tax data from Etrade using the HRB software. Up until 2-19-15, the HRB software returned the following error message: "Your import was unsuccessful. Try again later or enter your tax information manually from your paper documents. Error code: 2000".

Of course, anyone with even a modest number of trades knows that entering such information by hand is not a solution.  The error code means, according to the HRB technical help team, that login credentials could not be verified.  HRB indicated that it is a known problem and that they are working on it.

On 2-20-15, I received a message from Etrade confirming that import failure is a known issue, and that they "...received word from H&R Block that their software issue will be fixed no later than February 23rd."

Today's error message from HRB shifts the blame to Etrade: "Your financial institution doesn't have your form ready to import yet. You can enter information from your paper form now or wait until your import is ready (on Tuesday, February 24, 2015)."

Who's problem is it? Answer: yours.
I found this program to be easy to use. Their interview style walks you right through, you don't even know you are preparing a tax return. I especially like the way it will take you right to the actual Form and show you the worksheets on how they arrive at decisions. Tax Cut showed me that we could make an $1850 traditional IRA contribution for my wife that we thought was disallowed. I also liked the way it held my hand through the capital gains, 1099, and stock buy/sell recording. It lets you skip around, go back and forth. Viewing the actual worksheets that TaxCut uses to compute the values that get entered on the 1040 was a little difficult. I had to contact their tech support to find the long term tax computations. I initially contacted them through thier on-line chat, but my browser crashed, not their fault. I then emailed my question and they responded the next day. The info was there, I hadn't scrolled down enough. All-in-all, the tax prep portion was excellent, checking the calculations took a little getting used to the software. I will be buying this next year.

I have been using Taxcut for many years.  Many years ago I had difficulties with TurboTax which prompted me to use Taxcut the next year and I've been using Taxcut ever since - for the past 10 years. Taxcut is easy to use and less expensive than Turbotax for similar package features.
I have used TaxCut for years.  Prior to using TaxCut I used TurboTax for years.  TaxCut is much better.
Have used their software for the past 4 years and I love it, my sister who is an accountant in a bank started using it....love it and will continue using for years to come.
I've used H&R Block tax software for several years now and am really happy with the simplicity of use and its accuracy. I've used the "other" tax software prior to using H&R Block and never had the same positive results.
Been very happy with this software. I've been using it for a few years after having problems with TurboTax. I find it to be easy to use and have not had any problems. I highly recommend this Block software.
I've used TaxCut products for 15 years & am very comfortable with it. It all depends on what you get used to.
Great software.  I've been using H&R Block software for about 13  years without any problems or calculation errors.  I highly recommend it.
I have used several products like TaxCut. I think TaxCut is the most user friendly. This is the eight year I have used TaxCut and feel the results are good. Using the same software each year saves you time because you can roll last years information into this years.
If you've used TaxCut (now H&R Block), you'll be happy with each version they produce. I've been using H&R Block software for about 10 years now, and it works great for me!
Have been using this software for many years and each year it has been excellent. Handles all of my requirements without any issues. I highly recommend this product to anyone.

This is the best product with best offer. Unlike any other software, it comes with 10% refund bonus offer. We purchased hybrid car that came with tax credit and our refund was huge. So I got big Amazon credit as well. This is how bonus works. When you have $1000 refund, you have to choose how much you want to apply towards Amazon credit. If you choose $300, out of $1000 refund. Your monetary refund will be $700, Amazon credit will be $300+$30(bonus 10%). Isn't it a good deal? This is 2nd year using H&R block. I have used other soft wares but none of them are perfect.  H&R is  not the best but sufficient. If you have no tax knowledge at all or not financial savvy, I don't recommend. I am an accounting student and took tax courses. If you answer wrong for one question, and if you have no tax knowledge, you'll make a mistake and never notice.
Got the job done quick.  I used the gift certificate program too and it worked smoothly.  You get a 10% bonus if you take your refund in gift cards at various retailers.  I thought that might be some kind of scam, but I looked around online for any mention of deceptive practices and it seemed to be legit, so I tried it, and I got the bonus in gift cards for retailers I already shop at.  It all worked great.  I've already spent some of the gift cards and didn't run into any hassles.

The software itself was easy to use.  I've used TurboTax for years, but got tired of their shenanigans.  So I tried this.  It was cheaper, worked just as well, and got me my refund quick.  At a few points I had to hunt a bit for a form I needed, but that was usually True of TurboTax as well.
I use the H&R Block software every year because it offers the refund bonus offer when you receive your refund as a gift card. It's important to note that this year, Amazon was the only gift card option while in the past they have offered a wider variety of retailers.
*disclosure - I work in taxation, but I have no interests in any tax prep software company*

This software is pretty consistent, and is just as good as Turbo Tax. The main selling point over TT is price - you can usually find this package discounted well before TT goes on sale, and they do the same function. I've used both, and can't say that one has yielded better results than the other. For the basic filer, or for the filer with advanced tax knowledge, this software is adequate. If you're unsure how to get your tax info into the software, don't understand all your forms, etc and have the funds to do so, go to a reputable CPA. Don't waste your time with the tax prep guys you only see and hear about during tax season (such as Jackson Hewitt, or any of the fly-by-night vendors that might pop up in your local store/shopping center from January - April).
Everything performed flawlessly this year. The program worked and upgraded without issue. No surprises here. As a TurboTax refugee, I appreciate a  company that gives me what I paid for: no hidden agenda; no gimmicks or tricks to get you to spend more money. For my taxes, I'm sticking with HR Block from this point on.

I received my refund exactly on schedule. I had signed up for the 10% refund-bonus program. If you commit part of your refund (up to $5000) to Amazon gift cards, then you get an extra 10% free. So, as an example, for $4000 worth of gift cards, you get an extra $400. This all worked perfectly. The gift cards came in the same day as the refund. Well done, HR Block.
10% bonus offer was bogus. Had to converr refund to proprietary gift cards to use.
The most novice accessible tax prep software I have found on the market. And I spent nine years as a tax prep professional with a rival company,
The best! I have loved this software for 3 ownerships of the company which started it. Best in class as far as I have seen.
I have prepared my taxes using H&R Block's Deluxe tax software package for many years and find it works well, is intuitive and has no glaring flaws or software bugs. I'm posting a review before my purchase this year because I couldn't help but notice that Amazon seems to be trying to generate consumer bias for specific tax software bundles that benefit Amazon, and that's not so cool. The only versions of the H&R Block's tax software available as a download this year are those that include the Amazon 10% Refund Bonus Offer (i.e. if you use a portion of your refund to purchase Amazon gift cards, they will tack on "up to" 10% more); and in the case of the Deluxe Federal Only version, the one with the Amazon tie-in costs less as well ($24.97 versus $29.95 at the time of this review).

If you already planned to spend your refund on Amazon gift cards, that's a great deal, but this marketing method tries to sway you to do so whether you'd intended to or not. Sure, you can get the downloadable version and choose not to take advantage of the gift card bonus when it comes up in the tax prep dialogue, but who's going to pass up that carrot once it is there in your face?

Amazon incentives aside, shouldn't ALL online software purchases be available via download in 2016? Beardo thinks so.

I switched to TaxCut this year because I am unwilling to put up with TurboTax's "product activation" inconvenience, but I used TT for many years, and also checked out this year's TurboTax (ex-wife's copy) for comparison purposes.
The programs share several annoying flaws:
1.  Neither works right on a network, which is nonsense; lots of people have home networks for sharing printers, internet connections, etc., and it is often convenient to do at least some work on one's business computer.  In the case of TT, given their piracy paranoia, I presume this is intentional, so lots of people at an office can't share a single copy on a network.  What's TaxCut's excuse?  TurboTax at least tells you, up front, that they "don't support" use on a network.  Tax Cut doesn't (or, if it does, I missed it).
2.  The quality and quantity of help and technical support have been going down year by year in TurboTax, whether within the program, by phone, or on their web site.  This year, TaxCut is no better, help-wise, than TT (dunno about past years for TC, since, until this year, I was a loyal TurboTax user).  Neither is really acceptable this year if you have a problem, and neither is as good as TurboTax was a few years ago.  I encountered problems with both programs that I only managed to fix because of people on newsgroups and boards--no thanks to Intuit or Block.  At TurboTax, things may be slightly worse, simply because they're having to devote so many resources to dealing with product activation problems.  But Tax Cut is no great shakes in the help/tech support areas.  And past TurboTax experience suggests that both will only get worse as April 15 gets closer.
3.  Both TT and TC are obnoxious about hawking their other programs/services/tie-ins.
I find the TaxCut interview process slightly better designed than TurboTax's, as I didn't have to mindlessly click "no" to inapplicable questions as much with TaxCut as with TurboTax.  TaxCut also makes it easier to deal directly with forms.  For people who don't know what they're doing, but don't have ultra-simple returns, TurboTax's more mindless approach may be better.
But all in all, the programs are very much alike, to the point that I assume a lot of espionage and comparison is going on between them.  I'd give Tax Cut a very slight edge on functionality, and it's considerably cheaper.  If you don't object to Intuit's product activation nonsense, I'd still give TaxCut an endge.
Of course, I *do* object, very, very strongly, to TurboTax's product activation nonsense.  I find it completely unacceptable, and I will not buy TurboTax, or any other Intuit product, as long as they're using it.  Lucky for me, Block doesn't have the nonsense, and is a more-than-acceptable alternative otherwise.

Neither works right on a network, which is nonsense; lots of people have home networks for sharing printers, internet connections, etc., and it is often convenient to do at least some work on one's business computer.  In the case of TT, given their piracy paranoia, I presume this is intentional, so lots of people at an office can't share a single copy on a network.  What's TaxCut's excuse?  TurboTax at least tells you, up front, that they "don't support" use on a network.  Tax Cut doesn't (or, if it does, I missed it).
2.  The quality and quantity of help and technical support have been going down year by year in TurboTax, whether within the program, by phone, or on their web site.  This year, TaxCut is no better, help-wise, than TT (dunno about past years for TC, since, until this year, I was a loyal TurboTax user).  Neither is really acceptable this year if you have a problem, and neither is as good as TurboTax was a few years ago.  I encountered problems with both programs that I only managed to fix because of people on newsgroups and boards--no thanks to Intuit or Block.  At TurboTax, things may be slightly worse, simply because they're having to devote so many resources to dealing with product activation problems.  But Tax Cut is no great shakes in the help/tech support areas.  And past TurboTax experience suggests that both will only get worse as April 15 gets closer.
3.  Both TT and TC are obnoxious about hawking their other programs/services/tie-ins.
I find the TaxCut interview process slightly better designed than TurboTax's, as I didn't have to mindlessly click "no" to inapplicable questions as much with TaxCut as with TurboTax.  TaxCut also makes it easier to deal directly with forms.  For people who don't know what they're doing, but don't have ultra-simple returns, TurboTax's more mindless approach may be better.
But all in all, the programs are very much alike, to the point that I assume a lot of espionage and comparison is going on between them.  I'd give Tax Cut a very slight edge on functionality, and it's considerably cheaper.  If you don't object to Intuit's product activation nonsense, I'd still give TaxCut an endge.
Of course, I *do* object, very, very strongly, to TurboTax's product activation nonsense.  I find it completely unacceptable, and I will not buy TurboTax, or any other Intuit product, as long as they're using it.  Lucky for me, Block doesn't have the nonsense, and is a more-than-acceptable alternative otherwise.
It's about as good as ever with a few tweaks, one of which I'm not crazy about. That's the changes to Deduction Pro, which, to my way of thinking, makes it a little less easy to use. All in all, a very good program that's user friendly and at a better price than it's primary competitor.
This is a pretty good piece of software for basic use -- not intelligent enough to handle complex small business nuances, but great for the everyday user. The help could be better, but a the software is a very good value overall -- particularly with the state efile option. A quick TurboTax comparison last year revealed minimal differences for everyday users and AtHome is much cheaper. Stupid name -- they should have stuck with TaxCut.
This software is very user friendly and makes tax time a little less painful. I can sit at my desk with everything in front of me and take breaks when I want and still get it done quicker than going to someone else.
Very good product for the "normal" tax payer. Schedule C info is very good but some of the intricacies of LLC and S-Corp fillings are a bit harder to understand and the questions are not as clear as they should be.

Bottom line, if you own a home and you have mortgage and/or a sole propitiership, this is top notch 5 stars. If you recently formed an LLC and are looking towards this product I would strongly recommend you speak to a tax professional ( A CPA not one of the chain stores) instead.

Switched from Turbo to Tax Cut this year and was glad I did. It is a much simpler, cleaner program. No annoying little video people popping up over and over. It was easier to navigate, much quicker to use and written in good no-nonsense English. Even the help button usually helped.

Very good software package...easily understood, good internal monitoring controls and reminders.  Very good at finding errors and listing them for resolution.  Good product and good company.  You don't have to be an accountant to make good use of it.

I have an accountant who does my primary tax returns.

I have a children though who have minimal returns, but my accountant charges me $200 each for their returns.  Heck with that!

I bought this software, installed it, and knocked out both returns for the kids in less than two hours.  I was on a roll so I started plugging in my own return details and actually did it all myself.

So I skipped the accountant altogether this year, and saved $1400 in fees.  This was a simpler tax year for me with no complex company stock options involved, but it had its twists and this software handled it well.

Great savings and not as painful as I thought it would be.

Easy to use.  Great for figuring out how much to stuff into the IRA for the most favorable refund.  I used to have to fight my accountant for that, each year. And sometimes they charged extra for it.
  Fired the accountant, saving: 1) $450 in fees each year  2) Three hours each year arguing with stupid accountant  3) two hours driving time, round trip to accountant to drop off/pick up numbers  4) Two hours saved reading/answering stupid accountant's e-mail  5) One hour filling out customer profile/questionnaire for stupid accountant.
  Love the software.  As it may be seen by the above, my quality of life has been improved by simply being able restore eight hours out of my year for more meaningful things .. like washing the car.  Great, hassle-free software.  Buy it and you too can dump the stupid accountant !!!
I decided to take a chance on this product after closing another intrusive pop-up sales window in Intuit's QuickBooks program and fearing the problems I heard about on this year's edition of TurboTax.  I am so glad I did!  The home side was easy, updating was no problem and it discovered that my accountant had placed me in the wrong school district (a quick call to a school official confirmed this).  I have a VERY small business with two employees and the program was fine for that, however I can see where some people would question the 'robustness' of the product for larger businesses.  The Business side also discovered two errors my accountant made on last year's return (glad I dumped the accountant).  I am more than satisfied.

O YEA!  Love H&R Block.  Have rentals, am stock speculator and am a tax pro beyond usual tax pros in the sense that my experience includes but is not limited to IRS Tax Examiner, Tele Contact Rep, Revenue Officer and GS13/10 Analyst.  Did a two year stint as an Enrolled Agent.  One would hope that USAA Fed Sav Bank would pair up with H&R to create a Investment Portfolio download that is convenient but alas, USAA has gone ho-palloi.  One is unable to tell the difference between USAA and the Bank of So-Average.  Keep H&R Block -- scrap USAA Investments.  By the way --  H&R has a HEART!  They provided me at NO CHARGE  access to a tax filing year I needed when my WWII Army 3rd Division Hero Father passed.  H&R telephone contact reps are absolutely wonderful and pull out ALL the STOPS to provide the ultimate in elevated Customer Service.
Thank you for a great review, C. MacPhail. For a record, today the price dipped to $18.99 :)  NY state e-filing is free, as it becomes a mandatory this year. So if you file for NY state only, it will be only $18.99! Very cheap compared to Turbotax.

For everybody's consideration, I share my two cents as I happened to try all THREE major filing methods this year: an accountant, Turbotax(online trial version), and, H&R block software (a free promotion CD as I was a user in past). My conclusion is, all has pros and cons, you will need to pay your own attention to be accurate as possible, because none of them are perfect - just C. MacPhail and others said.

My accountant I hired was clearly wrong in a few tricky areas (bank interests, part-time state residency etc) which were originally the reasons why I initially intended to work with her this year - I've filed only with software before - to save the time for research/worries on those things. Why I found she was wrong? Because I used a free, promotional H&R Block software this year (it was mailed to me) to compare side by side as well as Turbotax's free draft online just in case. I know I'm a bit unusual, but at the same time I was so curious how much she could save money more than software - it turned out to be opposite! She came back with $1700 state PAYMENT while both software said $2500 REFUND. This is a too big difference to ignore.

Of course less refund does not mean incorrect, she could be right, the most importance is accuracy than more refund, so I even researched on IRS/state websites, tax advice websites and H&R block and Turbotax articles, and confirmed that my accountant was absolutely wrong and I was shocked how much a professional could be wrong; I could be filing wrongly for less refund, I pay more fee than software, then I might get audited so I have to hire an accountant again to represent?! So crazy. She was definitely acting professionally and caring in terms of communication, took time to explain why she did this, and nice enough to let me go without charging at all stating she was not comfortable in my case. But when her knowledge is wrong, that's wrong, I can't trust her work. I also found she was not particularly proactive to suggest any tax saving tips/questions either as she is already busy with her other clients...

So I'd say, if you don't want to worry or don't have a time at all for DIY, your tax situation is way complicated, AND if you have found a great accountant you can trust, the high price for accountants worth it. I thought I carefully selected this accountant by interviewing several ones based on people's recommendations/Yelp reviews, confirming she said she could handle my situations before hiring her, but still her job was wrong where I concerned, and she gave up on my case at end. Maybe it is my fault choosing her, but she does have a good background/experience/reviews on my resume!!!

For tax tips, I feel software definitely does a better job (the problem is that you have to understand and translate into your case by yourself; this is where accountants are supposed to be better when they knows your situation inside out and have a time to care and ask). I'd say, if you are fairly confident with software and go by price, H&R block software is definitely an winner. Turbotax does have more sophisticated user interface (as suggested in C. MacPhail's review), but H&R block software did suggest some tax tip better than Turbotax while H&R block made me nervous when it lets me get in actual form to enter numbers, in my case.

If you could, try both before paying, and go for which you felt comfortable. The both software is comparable, it is really a personal preference and convenience. You could try an accountant too like I did, but remember, we could get audited/get errors even if we pay more $$$ to the accountant. Since there will be always a chance to get audited with any method, why don't we go for software which is cheaper and actually more time-saving if you are an worried type like me. Good luck and happy tax filing!
Does a fine job like it does every year. Easily pulls my W2 out of ADP and supported most of my brokerages.
Advice more succinct and less demeaning than Turbo Tax.  Fails to differentiate itself in the handling of investments and does not handle new high-deductible health savings accounts well (does not let you view the form and offers little advice or direction), which are my drivers for buying the more expensive Deluxe package.
What can I say, I have been using these guys for a while and they have never disappointed. I have been audited once and they answered all the question and in fact I enjoyed the auditing session considering enjoy and irs auditing does not go together.

Although i had to do my taxes twice due to a major mechanical breakdown in my laptop (laptop vs. road), I was able to complete the second iteration in about 90 minutes and get my junk mailed on time.  Hate the taxes but the product is complete and self explanatory.
Logical, Clear, Familiar, knows what life events (moving, having children, adoption, deaths in the household, etc. prompt questions that could lead you to even lower tax rates -- and potentially a larger return!
After procrastinating until the last minute, Tax Cut again got me through the ordeal of filing my taxes on time with little effort. The only short coming with the package is, a 80 minute download if using a modem. The 80 minutes turned in to 3 hours with a couple of disconnects.

Great product. A few areas require moving around a lot. Also I felt the updates were slow in coming out. These updates were necessary to complete your taxes. This held me up sending my taxes in by a 2-weeks.
This is my first time doing my own taxes and so far this has been a very simple process.  The software is very simple and the questions it asks is straightforward.  I basically gathered all of my tax documents, checked the boxes of what I had, and plugged in the numbers.  I got this on sale during the black Friday time frame for about $35.  I would definitely recommend this software to anyone who wants to do their own taxes.  I will definitely purchase this again next year.
I have relatively complicated taxes from investments and military moves, but this software does awesome!  I can usually knock out my taxes in about 3-4 hours and get huge refunds.  Plan on using this software every year.
I WAS afraid of taxes...  but this product takes you thru your taxes step by step in an interview process.  Easy to use.  Never dreamed it would be FUN to use!  I feel confident in doing my own taxes now after pouring thousands of dollars into the hands of tax preparers over the years.
My husband and I have used HR Block at Home for about 8 years and think it's totally worth the money.  The first few years we sat through the whole tutorial and learned the ins and outs of our deductions.  This year we buzzed right through and electronically submitted our returns in about an hour and half.  Long gone are the days of paying someone too much to do them for us or spending hours and hours looking things up and doing them by hand!
I'm gonna make it short, i needed a software that would do my self-employed tax (1140) and my personal,(1040) this one did it easily, efficiently and cheaply, my taxes were simple, some 1099 and w2, there were no problem at all, i used to pay $200 + for someone just to put all the information i gave them in this software and do the taxes for me, not anymore. e-file my personal, got it ok, mailed my 1140s no probs. my first time ever doing my taxes and no probs, if you have any doubts just consult your old tax return. For somethings you really need to have it because you have to select the same options as before. It's a lot better when do it yourself as you don't have to share your personal information with anyone and you have better control on what you doing adjusting as you go. Ok it's not short anymore, so..., grab a cup of coffee, in my case a beer , sit down, relax and go.

I purchased this product.

I used this product. It is good for someone with Knowledge of the tax code or someone who knows his way around the forms.

I purchased this product for two reasons:
1.  It was less than turbo tax.
2.  I had previously used it.

It was very straightforward and efficient.  It came close to what I wanted to accomplish.

But, in the end I needed additional aid with my multiple and rollover Stock transactions.  I was not able to locate my paperwork for these.  Therefor I was in a jam.  I also ended up getting turbotax.

The Turbo tax is has an automated feature in it that allows you to get the research history and do the computations for all the mulitple entries.

Conclusion:

PRO:
1. Good Product.
2. Well Priced.
3. Does what it says.
4. Stable.

Cons:
1.  It is for the experienced user and the one that does not have significant detailed transactions(or for the one who is not organized enough with his papwerwork.)
2.  Requires deeper understanding of the forms and there True functionalities.
3.  Lacking some additional "features"/"widgets" for the normal/inexperienced user.

Generally a very useful product. I use it for small family business matters including leasing, liability releases, etc. In every case that I have created a document I have submitted it to our attorney for review before using the documents. And in every case our attorney has had only minor change suggestions. In large part these are due to local (state or other local) requirements. One improvement they could make would be to allow the software to adapt documents to comply with state laws. I also found the software to be occassionally un-stable and crash. This problem has persisted across two computers first with Windows 98 and later Windows XP. But it is still worth having.

I have used H&R Block's TaxCut program (predecessor to H&R Block at Home) for several years and have been very pleased - it does a good job, and is easy to navigate.

This year I ordered H&R Block at Home that was clearly labeled as being a CD, requiring a CD-ROM drive; that is exactly what I have - a CD drive, but not a DVD drive.  When it arrived, I put the CD (or what looked like a CD) in the drive, but it did not open, even though the drive acted like it was opening the program.  When I checked the properties (by right-clicking the drive), it showed that the CD was completely full, meaning that the CD had been "burned" as having a program but contained "0 bytes."  A tech guru also tried it, with the same result; then he put it in a laptop's DVD drive, opened it and copied the program to a flash drive, then installed that on my computer.

So, even though Amazon's info listed the program as being a CD, and even though the printed box that the program came in also listed the program as being a CD, it was actually a DVD and had been "burned" as a DVD.  Those people who have a DVD drive on their computer might not ever notice the difference, but for those of us who have only a CD drive, it is a critical difference.  The fault here is not with Amazon; instead the fault is with whoever actually "burned" the CD's for H&R Block.

As for the program that the guru got installed on my computer, it worked great; I e-filed my tax return yesterday with no apparent problems!
Software worked great once loaded. Have been using same program for several years and tax preparation is relatively painless. Unable to load program directly from disc. Sent first one back because I thought it was defective. New disc had same issue. Ended up copying contents to hard drive and that worked.
The product is well worth the price. Documents are easy to create and modify. However, I can find no way to save the documents other than in the program files, nor have I been able to print to PDF. This makes document handling and storage very inconvenient unless you are always on the same computer. The program was so inexpensive that I can hardly complain.
Don't let the claims form the other products fool you.

The base of this product came from Kiplinger's tax cut, a well known and extremely trusted financial adviser.

Yes, H&R may have made a few changes that may make you think  that this product has declined in quality.  But I can assure you the core and original intent of Kiplinger's product is still here.

Always happy with H&R Block.  I needed to refer to my old tax info, but could not find the old disc.  With this type of program, I prefer a disc, rather than a download, for just this situation. The original program was installed on an older laptop which does not work dependably.  I was delighted to find that Amazon still had the old program available for sale.  (Of course, I have since located the original disc, too!)

Very easy to use. The question-answer format works very well.

There is one problem though. When I made corrections I found that my earlier uncorrected versions still exisited as earlier "copies" and the values on these earlier copies were sometimes used in the final summary forms. I finally discovered how to remove these earlier (unwanted) copies, but it would have been far better if copies were clearly defined & methods for removing unwanted copies were clearly given up front.
Works as described. received timely
Received timely.  Had some minor problems with initial set-up but worked fine after that.
Worked perfectly fine.  The math was correct as well as the graphics.
Unfortunately, it works as described and the the government took my money, as described.
Tax Cut did everything I expected and more.  The four stars was only because it was a little difficult to read the help messages and their rebates are a borderline scam (save absolutely all your receipts and retail paperwork, or you may not have what they require for the rebate)...  Improvements there would give it five in my book.  I'm not sure why all the complaining, Tax Cut worked fine for me.

Great product for simple taxes.  I buy this to do my sons taxes and this was a great deal!  Seller sold for a great price and shipping was incredibly fast.
Overall, the merchant was great in regards to this purchase. I'm giving the merchant an excellent A+ rating. However, there were mailing issues related to the shipment of this product that were not related in any way with the merchant but due wholly at the receiving end with local USPS delivery to my home. The Merchant, however, still gets an A+ for promptness, courtesy, and professionalism and for being a first-rate vendor to do business with.
Great product, great price, fast shipping.
The product is fine; service and delivery were flawless.  The only drawback was that shortly after buying it I received an ad for the same product at a less price.
Fast shipping, great price and proven product.

TaxCut offers individuals a powerful option for preparing an income tax return that is relatively easy to use. TaxCut assumes that you know little or nothing about income tax law. The software will ask a number of questions and will prompt you for information based on your answers. It will help tremendously if you gather as many of your tax documents as possible before starting. This software is significantly cheaper than paying a service to prepare it and much easier than doing in manually.

The e-file option has been around for some years and is a great way to get your refunds faster. But if you owe money, there's not as much of an advantage.  Still, you get five free electronic filing so you might as well use one.  In the unlikely event that you plan to prepare more than five returns, make sure you use the e-file for the ones due a refund and file the ones with money due manually.  The program will print all the forms you need so it's easy to do and it will save you the cost of the fees for the additional e-files.

The one negative for this program is that the publisher used to offer free e-filing for the state return as well as federal but has dropped that for the 2008 edition.  With a charge weighing in a whopping $19.95 for e-filing each state return, this is not a trivial fee.  I would recommend filing state returns manually unless you will receive a refund large enough to make getting the check a week or so faster worth that extra money.

Please note that this version covers both Federal and State returns. Most people will need both, but if you live in a state with no income tax then you'll want to look at&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/H-R-Block-TaxCut-2008-Premium-Federal-e-file/dp/B001HO6Q7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">H&R Block TaxCut 2008 Premium Federal + e-file</a>&nbsp;for considerably less money.

If you don't itemize your deductions and have a very simple return, you might be better off preparing the forms manually on your own. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you have a return with major league complications, you should probably go to a good CPA. For everyone else, this is really a no-brainer. It's inexpensive, easy to use, and accurate. I've been using TaxCut for quite a few years and would not even consider giving it up.

The e-file option has been around for some years and is a great way to get your refunds faster. But if you owe money, there's not as much of an advantage.  Still, you get five free electronic filing so you might as well use one.  In the unlikely event that you plan to prepare more than five returns, make sure you use the e-file for the ones due a refund and file the ones with money due manually.  The program will print all the forms you need so it's easy to do and it will save you the cost of the fees for the additional e-files.

There are a couple of issues to take note of if you buy this version of TaxCut.  First, this version covers only federal tax returns and does not include a program for state taxes.  If you live in a state with no income tax, this is the version you want.  But if you do need to file with your state, you'll want to buy the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/H-R-Block-TaxCut-2008-Premium-Federal-State-e-file/dp/B001HOD50K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">H&R Block TaxCut 2008 Premium Federal + State + e-file</a>&nbsp;version.  Second, there are some tax tools not included in this package that would require the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/H-R-Block-TaxCut-2008-Premium-Federal-e-file/dp/B001HO6Q7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">H&R Block TaxCut 2008 Premium Federal + e-file</a>&nbsp;version.  These probably won't be needed by everyone, but take a good look at the chart in the product description area to see if you will miss the features or not.

If you don't itemize your deductions and have a very simple return, you might be better off preparing the forms manually on your own. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you have a return with major league complications, you should probably go to a good CPA. For everyone else, this is really a no-brainer. It's inexpensive, easy to use, and accurate. I've been using TaxCut for quite a few years and would not even consider giving it up.
TaxCut offers individuals a powerful option for preparing an income tax return that is relatively easy to use.  TaxCut assumes that you know little or nothing about income tax law.  The software will ask a number of questions and will prompt you for information based on your answers.  It will help tremendously if you gather as many of your tax documents as possible before starting.  This software is significantly cheaper than paying a service to prepare it and much easier than doing in manually.

The e-file option has been around for some years and is a great time saver for those due a refund.  If you owe money, you might want to save a few dollars and just file manually.  The program will print all the forms you need so it's easy to do and there's no real advantage to electronically filing if you're writing a check.

Please note that this version covers both Federal and State returns.  Most people will need both, but if you live in a state with no income tax then you'll want to look at&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/H-R-Block-TaxCut-2007-Premium-Federal-Win-Mac/dp/B000WPWYJS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">H&R Block TaxCut 2007 Premium Federal (Win/Mac)</a>&nbsp;for considerably less money.

First time user of Taxcut and pleased with it so far.  As my husband and I are filing jointly for the first time (as a same-sex couple living in California), Taxcut's software was unclear about how to file our taxes since our marriage (not RDP) is only recognized at the state level and not federally.  Hopefully this information garnered from taxcut.com will help others in similar situations out: the key is that one will need to file as unmarried individuals on the federal (and can efile) but state taxes will need to be mailed in; since the program uses your federal filing status (married/unmarried) to do the state taxes, one needs to rerun the program with a mock federal filing in the program (without actually submitting the federal form) to then be able to get the corrected married-couple settings for the state filing section.  Ah the joys of second-class citizenship in socially barbaric country.  See below:

Issue: Filing a joint federal return with a same-sex partner

For federal tax purposes, a marriage is a legal union only between a man and a woman as husband and wife. This means you can't file a joint federal return with a partner of the same sex. However, some states allow joint filing for registered domestic partnerships, civil unions, or same-sex marriages. These states include:

  * California
  * Connecticut
  * District of Columbia
  * New Hampshire
  * Massachusetts
  * New Jersey
  * Vermont

You can file joint state returns with TaxCut for domestic partnerships, same-sex marriages, and civil unions by following these steps:

1. To meet your federal tax obligation, each party must complete a federal tax return using one of the following filing statuses:
  * Single
  * Head of Household
  * Qualifying Widow(er)
You cannot file a federal return using the Married Filing Jointly or Married Filing Separately status.

2. For your state return, you must decide whether you want to file Married Filing Jointly or Married Filing Separately. In most cases, filing jointly works to your advantage.

3. Complete another federal return with a filing status of either Married Filing jointly or Married Filing Separately to use as a base for your state return. Do not file this return.
Note: The filing status you use should correspond to the filing status you want to use for your state return.

4. Complete your state return.

5. You must file a paper return and mail it. We'll include mailing instructions when you complete your return.

I just buy the Deluxe version, complete both Federal and State, then I file the Federal electronically through H&R.

Then I will fill print the completed State's 1040 (which is free) and go to our state's website in Illinois ([...]) where you can file for free electronically and receive direct deposit or check.
I pay the for the software to ensure I get the numbers correct since I do 3 different family member's returns. I file 3 different federal returns electronically through H&R (5 are included in the Deluxe version) and 3 different state returns through the IL website.

You can verify you did it correctly on the state's website if your state's return amount in the printed 1040 from H&R program matches what you will see on the IL website before you submit it.

Overall, I pay $20 total to do the 3 returns - Double check that your state offers the free service and go from there.
There is a lot of confusion about fees for doing your personal tax returns using tax software.

The main distinction is that there is a difference between *preparing* a tax return and *e-filing* or *filing* a tax return.

The difference between *e-filing* a tax return and just *filing* a tax return using tax software like H&R Block or TurboTax etc. is that *e-filing* means the prepared tax return is submitted to the tax authority electronically. You can, if you wish, print the prepared tax return instead, put it in an envelope, and sent it to the tax authority by mail - this would be *filing* the tax return, as opposed to *e-filing*.

With the H&R Block Tax Software Deluxe + State 2014 software, you are paying for software which will enable you to *prepare* up to 5 Federal tax returns and and *prepare* up to 5 State tax returns for ONE State only.

When it comes to submitting the Federal tax returns, there is no e-filing fee - you can e-file up to 5 Federal tax returns electronically with this software, and there's no additional cost to do so. You can still print them out and mail them in if you wanted do, but I don't see why anyone would want to since e-filing the Federal tax returns is free, unless you have additional documentation the IRS require.

When it comes to submitting the State tax returns, you have two options:
(1) you can print out the prepared State tax return, put it in an envelope, and mail it to your State tax authority, and the only cost would be the stamp to send it, OR
(2) you can *e-file* the prepared State tax return via the software, and there will be an e-filing fee of $19.99 per State tax return to do so. This is not specific to H&R Block - you'll find TurboTax does it, as do all the others, to my knowledge. The one exception I am aware of is for New York State personal income tax filers - most New York State personal income tax filers can e-file for free, but that is mandated by New York State Law, meaning H&R Block, TurboTax etc. are not allowed to charge for e-filing in New York State. Let's hope other States start pushing similar legislation.

That's basically all there is to that.

Another point to note: if you need to file tax returns in more than one State, you will have to pay for additional software to *prepare* returns for those additional State(s) - I believe the cost is around $39.95 for each State, and that will allow up to 5 tax returns to be *prepared* (not e-filed) for each State purchased. You will also still be subject to another $19.99 e-filing fee for each additional State return filed as well (with the exception of New York). This is the same for TurboTax and all other retail tax software suppliers, to my knowledge.

There has also been comments about a $29.95 refund processing fee. I'll explain what I believe this fee is about. This fee is mostly mentioned with reference to TurboTax products, but I'll mention it here in case H&R Block have the same policy. When you have finished preparing your State tax return and elect to e-file it for the $19.99 fee mentioned above, you have an option to pay that $19.99 fee online by credit card right there and then, or have it deducted from your State tax refund. If you pay by credit card right there and then, there should not be any return processing fee. If you instead elect to pay that $19.99 fee by having it deducted from your State tax return, guess what - you're going to get hit with a $29.95 refund processing fee on top, just for the 'effort' of the company having to take their $19.99 out of it. That is what that fee is all about, I believe. Clearly it is better to pay the $19.99 by credit card right there and then, if you are able to.

Any H&R Block staff reading this please comment if I've said anything incorrect here and I will amend it accordingly.

On a personal note, I have used TurboTax Deluxe for years, and like many others, have switched to H&R Block Deluxe for my 2014 taxes because of TurboTax pulling what could be considered as a classic "bait and switch" by requiring an expensive upgrade to their Premier edition in order to get the same features that were previously always available in the Deluxe edition (for me, it was IRS Schedule D filing). Fortunately H&R Block have not made such a change. I filed my 2014 returns a couple of days ago using H&R Block Deluxe tax software and had zero issues importing my 2013 TurboTax file and completing my 2014 returns on H&R Block Deluxe. I appreciated the H&R Block charitable donation calculator, and use of the product was extremely intuitive. I have no intention of going back to TurboTax in future years.. particularly when TurboTax Premier was retailing at approximately 4 times what I paid for H&R Block Deluxe at the time I purchased it, for the same feature set! Thank you H&R Block.
