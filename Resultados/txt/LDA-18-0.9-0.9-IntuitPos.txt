This product is great, it organizes your finance. I like to use it when I am looking for a certain transaction, you can find it immediately. Have you ever tried to look through pages and pages of your checkbook register?

It is great at tax time also, just bring up the tax related tranactions and print it out and take it with you to get your taxes done or use it if filing your taxes yourself.

Quicken is great when a payee stated they didn't receive your payment. Just look it up on Quicken and give the payee also the details.<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Indian-Maiden-w-Wolves-Framed-Indian-Picture/dp/B0033E1K0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Indian Maiden w/ Wolves Framed Indian Picture</a><a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Framed-Indian-BRAVES-Picture-Native-American-Art-9-x-11-including-frame-Reproduction/dp/B0033DP1AA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Framed Indian BRAVES Picture Native American Art 9 x 11 (including frame) Reproduction</a><a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Framed-Indian-WOLVES-Picture-Native-American-Art-9-x-11-including-frame-WOLF-Reproduction/dp/B0033DV6J0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Framed Indian WOLVES Picture Native American Art 9 x 11 (including frame) WOLF Reproduction</a><a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Framed-Indian-EAGLES-Picture-Native-American-Art-9-x-11-including-frame-Reproduction/dp/B0033EH030/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Framed Indian EAGLES Picture Native American Art 9 x 11 (including frame) Reproduction</a>

Over the years Quicken has improved, and many bugs have been removed. Customer Service has been improved recently.

However, in one respect Quicken has not kept up with the times. It is generally said that more and more people are investing in options, common puts and calls, not private company options. Intuit seems unaware of this.

Quicken still does not download updated prices for puts and calls even though brokerage sites list them the same as stock prices. The data are available, but Intuit will not make the changes to download these prices. Be aware that if you buy or sell puts or calls in your portfolio, to update prices you will have to go to your brokerage website every day and print out the prices, and then enter all by hand into Quicken.

Write Intuit aboput this!

This program does so much.  I've always been afraid to do my own taxes but this program keeps up with everything for me and is suppose to just move right over to the tax program at the frst of the year. I am still finding things that this program will do.  The only thing I wish it had was a user guide.
I have use TurboTax for many years and the 2013 issue does not disappoint.  The program just keeps getting better and easier to use.
Quicken Essentials was absolutely fine for what I need. I was used to Quicken, and this new program for Mac does the job just fine. Nothing great or earth shattering, just good tracking of my spending and the reports I need at tax time. What's all the complaining about??
I hve used Turbo Tax for at least 10 years.  It does a great job.  But... I wish they would set a menu tree to the side to make it easier to jump to entries easier.  And even after so many years, the program still does not keep some radial buttons marked (i.e. none of the above) so the program prompts at the same questions everytime, even if you save, reenter the program and go back to an earlier item.
Works as advertised, nothing special just works.  Works as advertised nothing special just works like advertised so that is all.
I have been using Quicken since the 1980's.  It just keeps getting better and easier to use.  My only pet peeve is the auto naming and automated categorization.  It assumes much too much!!
I have been using Quicken since the mid eighties, and it just keeps getting better and better. I'd recommend it to anyone.
I have used Quicken for years and it just keeps getting better and better.

I find the walk-through of all the questions very easy to complete my taxes. The questions aid me in claiming all my deductions.
The section dealing with valuating items donated to charities is invaluable in estimating my charitable donations.
TURBOTAX is everything it is advertised to be.

I started using TurboTax in 2002 and have used it every year since. As my tax situation has grown more complicated with investments and a business, it has more than met my needs. It is easy-to-use, complete, and hassle-free.

I take comfort in knowing that it doesn't overlook deductions, credits, or expenses. Once I have gone through the interview process (which is ridiculously simple), I know I have touched all the bases.

Its Deductible is so good I bought it outright a couple of years ago. For charitable donations of clothes, mileage, and money it is excellent. To have a software package that properly values a short sleeve silk women's blouse in good condition is worth it's weight in gold.

TurboTax has saved me money on taxes and given me peace of mind.

As usual, I like the way that TurboTax guides me through the whole process, directing me to the appropriate IRS documents if I want to read them. The questions and answers under "Help" also provide information that I find very helpful especially when an answer is from a TurboTax expert. When I became a self-employed consultant, I had my taxes done by an accountant. It cost me hundreds of dollars and I think some of the deductions he took for me were not always appropriate. After two years of that, I am back to TurboTax where I can make my own decisions based on IRS publications and expert advice. I spend a lot less money and am more comfortable with the level of potential problems if I am audited.
I also tried H&R Block software a few years ago and found it to be less intuitive to use than TurboTax.
I've used TurboTax for years. I've heard people say it doesn't cover all aspects of deductions. I say BS (to put is simply).  For those with simple tax returns, Turbo is more than most will ever need.  Yet, if you have many expenses/deductions across the board, Turbo will cover them all.

I'm in Law Enforcement, own a property, give to charity, home energy improvements, etc. Turbo covers ALL areas of deductions and tax preparation.  TT covers all my standard deductions; mortgage interest, property taxes, work expenses (equipment costs, labor dues, education expenses), energy efficient upgrades to the house, charitable donations, tax software, medical, you name it.

My father spent years doing taxes by hand. He finally used Turbo Tax to file his returns related to not just my folks, but the combining of trusts of his parents into his own. It all was covered in Turbo Tax

If you make charitable donations during the year, considering using ItsDeductible online (another Intuit software).  The benefit is goods are valued based on national averages.  Those jeans you gave to good will for free, have a fair market value of $10.  I'm continually amazed at what people donate to charities like Goodwill, who never deduct the goods, which is perfectly legal to do.  ItsDeductible lists 1000s of items for donation and assigned a value.  Few realize, you are allowed to deduct the "fair market value" of goods you donate. So, if Goodwill sells jeans for $10, that is what you deduct.  ItsDeductible has made my donations easy, good value and when you use TurboTax, it will import your donations from I.D. into your tax return.
A combination of questions translated from whatever language the IRS uses into reasonably plain English, carrying forward info from previous years and handling all the math, makes filing about as easy as possible.  This is as a self employed contractor with rental property so there is depreciation, a health savings account, vehicle mileage and variety of expenses.

Quicken  is a great tool for personal finance.  In these tough times it is very helpful to see where the money goes.  Great aid in budgeting for a family. Very easy to use.
Use it every year, and always get a refund, how great is that. It's so simple to use, it's great.
This is a great tool to use to stay on budget.  We use this along with Dave Ramsey's plan to stay on budget.  Thanks Quicken.
Not much you can add about QuickBooks, its excellence is well known.  Combine that with Amazon's great pricing and speedy delivery, it is great-great-great!
Always use this tool, great.
Great program -easy to use - on screen assistance fantastic - great purchase- will purchase and use in future tax years
I am a Quicken advocate. The newest release has a great "add and view bill reminders directly from you register" that is a great benefit to me. It's a great organizational tool. I haven't had the opportunity to use the snap & store receipts yet but the concept is great!

I've used TurboTax for over 15 years now, I can't imagine using anything else.
I've used TurboTax for about 9 or 10 years now and I think it's a very solid product. I've found it very easy to use. I'd guess that I've saved at least a hundred dollars every year I've used it.
I've been using TurboTax for 10 years or more, and will continue to do so. The user-friendliness of the interface has increased over the years.
Not disappointed - again.  I have been a Quicken customer for many years and years and years and years and years.
Have used Quicken well over 20 years now.  It's been amazing with the changes throughout the years.  Will continue to use another 20 years. Thanks!

Another review lambasted this version of TurboTax for not working with Mac's Snow Leopard (OSX 10.6.8).  It very well may not have worked for them.  HOWEVER, the information they gave to determine if it will work or not was totally wrong.  By their information my system would not have worked, but indeed it does.  If you follow the tech support links they provided to Intuit, then to Apple, you get to [...]  which has a little table to show you what processor is 64 bit:

Intel Core Solo  32 bit
Intel Core Duo  32 bit
Intel Core 2 Duo  64 bit
Intel Quad-Core Xeon  64 bit
Dual-Core Intel Xeon  64 bit
Quad-Core Intel Xeon  64 bit
Core i3  64 bit
Core i5  64 bit
Core i7  64 bit

If so, you can run this version of TurboTax.  For instance, my 2010 iMac uses a Core i3 processor, which is 64 bit, and TurboTax works.  However by the other incorrect reviewer's reply, my computer would have "failed".
We have been running both Quicken and Quickbooks on a PC. So, when I bought my Mac,  I bought Parallels to allow me to  run Windows software in a virtual window. This works okay but I have found that Quicken runs A LOT  faster in a native environment. Transferring my Windows data to the Mac OS10 environment was seamless. I would encourage Mac users who are using Quicken in a Windows environment to check out the Mac version of Quicken. YMMY
One reviewer said it works fine in 32 bit if you have a core2duo or higher processor. The core2duo is a 64-bit processor--the earlier core duo is 32 bit--so this is why it will work if you have at least the core2duo--it is 64-bit.  So, as others have said, only 64-bit macs will work--I also can confirm no problems in snow leopard.
Avid Quicken 2013 user with my former PC. Now, I'm an avid Quicken user with my new Mac. Look, the Mac version is different, entirely, that the PC version (2013). After a couple of weeks though - I love the new Mac version, too. I miss many features from the PC version - so here's to Quicken adding similar functionality regarding extra reports, extra views, etc.

Recommend for new/old Quicken users on Mac OS X.
Quicken Mac 2016 is certainly easier to view than Quicken Windows 2015 on a Mac.  Q2016 appears logical, and appears fairly easy to use, even with investments. It does not yet have the individual easy answer graphing and reporting capability of Quick Mac 2007, or Quicken Windows 2015, but I do find it useable.

Quicken Windows 2015 on a Mac often pops the curser to an unexpected spot, and has frequent Backup notices which interrupt your work. Quicken Mac 2016 does not have this problem. Quicken Mac also keeps the font sizes consistently even, unlike Quicken Windows 2015 on a Mac.

I am currently using all three versions (Quicken Mac 2007 on an older computer using Snow Leopard which still funs my favorite database that current Mac versions won't as well as several other older paid off Adobe programs. I am using the two newer versions of Quicken on a Retina 27" Mac. after a few more months with Quicken Mac 2016, I will probably discontinue using Quicken Windows 2015 on my newer Mac.
what I really need to say is that this version of Quicken seems much more STABLE and less buggy than previous versions... I am running 64 bit Windows 7 so I am not sure if this has anything to do with it but I have found the 2010 version of Quicken to be a drastic improvement over the 2009 version which was a totally shameful release of garbage. In other respects, the 2010 version is easier to use and has a much cleaner interface than 2009 and prior versions.  In short, this is a worthy upgrade.
I've used Quicken for probably 8-10 years and have never had any problems with it. My previous version was 2013 and I just upgraded to 2016, no problems importing. When comparing the 2013 version with the 2016 version, it appears that the 2016 version is a bit slower and slightly less responsive then the 2013 version.
I've been using Quicken98 since Y2K. It's the last 16bit version, which I had to have when I was running it in OS/2.  For the last several years I've been running Quicken98 in Linux using Wine.  I recently bought a new computer with a 64bit processor, so I had to upgrade to a 32bit version.  The Quicken2008 interface seems a bit more cluttered than Quicken98 but it runs fine in 64bit Linux.  I'm glad there were old versions available at a reasonable price.
I have used quicken for 19 years on various mac computers and currently use this version running on a Macbook Pro dual core running OS Mountain Lion.  However to run the program on OS Lion you must additionally purchase the upgrade for $14.99 from Quicken which you can get from: [...]  From what I have read the Mac version is not as robust as the Windows version, so Windows converts may instead want to consider running the Windows version on bootcamp.
I must admit I was skeptical switching from the PC version to the Mac version, but I must say the learning curve was not very dramatic and I found the Mac version to be just as capable as the PC version.

As a long-term quicken user, I am pleased with this product.  It has improved reports and graphics and still has the capability to track stocks and mutual funds.  The cash flow report is always the most important part of quicken because it allows the user to track personal finances.
One small bug has always botherered me, however.  For retirement accounts containing mutual funds, quicken adds all distributions to the account holder's basis.  This is inconsistent with IRS practice, which is that the distributions are not taxed and therefore are not added to the shareholder's basis.  This bug leads to some inaccurate gain and loss results for retiremment accounts.

I have been using Quicken on my Mac for over a decade and really like this new version - Quicken Essentials. It allows me to monitor all my accounts (bank, credit cards, loans, investment accounts, retirement accounts and 401 accounts) in one place and updates those accounts it ensure that I have the latest status. I like be able to establish a budget including a savings plan and then monitor my progress against by plan. Quicken Essentials allows me to monitor my entire financial plan in one simple picture and then shows me my progress toward my financial goals.

I use Quicken to manage all my personal incomes and expenses. I seamlessly maintain my CC and bank accounts and interactively pay bills on line through the application interface. I have a sole proprietorship that I manage financially through my Quicken Home & Business, including invoicing and statements. This allows me to maintain money management between personal and business finances. I also am able to easily manage may IRA and other investment accounts either directly in Quicken or interactively with my financial institution. How simple can it be!
For the money you can't beat Quicken.
Quicken works great for my needs - investment tracking and daily pricing, credit card activity tracking, mortgage tracking, bank account reconciliation, transaction downloading, and customized reporting and transaction searching.  No experience with budgeting features.  Tracking finances is greatly simplified, well organized and it maintains a history than can be very useful.  If you are downloading transactions, you need to upgraded at least every three years.  I'm happy to do so.
My MS Money Plus online quoting service is about to expire.  Being 100% faithful to Money I was upset they canned the software and reluctantly converted to Quicken over the weekend.  I refuse to put my entire financial picture online with web services.  Quicken is the only software solution and now enjoys a near monopoly in the market.  I used Money heavily from banking, to credit cards, investments, property and debt to some of the tax categories.  To my surprise, on conversion everything transferred with ease.  Was able to completely replicate my stock portfolio view and resume automatically downloading 401k transactions and updated stock quotes.  In fact, I barely had to touch the investments to correct a few stock basis's.  It's more or less just getting everything to display how you desire.  Investing contribution accounts that were separate in Money can be handled directly in the investment account and then disabled/hidden in quicken.  You still have your choice on one vs two lines on entry in checking accounts.  Home page appears lacking but I haven't yet customized that view.  The only thing I miss is the ability to track frequent flier miles and hotel points with direct entries from the credit card reconciliation screens.  Application performance is actually much better than Money.  I did archive and backup before the conversion but many of my accounts were in existence from the early Money days.  Slight nuances prevent it from 5 stars but that's more personal preference than anything else.  Hope this e-mail helps all those that will have to convert in the near future.  It's a fairly quick transition.
When I initially setup Quicken Deluxe, it took about three days to get my bank accounts into the database, categorize transactions, and try and develop a budget. It went about that far before I noticed the lack of a "cash projection" function based on the budget, but rather only from scheduled bills.

Budgeting with bill and income reminders isn't that bad; the projection works rather well as long as you count on everything including misc expenses, which can be a pain but is doable. Keeping a cash ledger that I reconcile the extra out of works best for me, with regards to modestly tracked cash spending.

Regardless, the balance projections need to be updated to both source from the budget OR the bill reminders. Or, even better, bill reminders should be suggested when you setup your budget. Actually any effort at all to link the two would be good. Reports based on the projection data would be great - I've been planning my general spending as much as 90 days out, but the graph gets overly busy at 12 months.

Other than that, it's a decent product and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to stop drowning in paper bills and reminders.
Quicken Essentials for Mac takes all the work out of watching my finances. I can easily update the information from my three financial institutions and the reports feature allows me to view all the data from my financial institutions as a whole. I created my own hierarchial category list and the categories enter easily when I create a new transaction. Entering credit or debit amounts never gets mixed up due to failure to insert a minus sign since the minus sign is automatically entered depending on where the amount is entered, on the left or the right. The scheduled transactions allow me to project future cash flow. I simply scan ahead on the balance column to see where things might get tight and then I can cut back on spending. I use a lot of automatic deposits and automatic payments on my bank accounts or credit cards to pay bills and the scheduled transactions keep track of it all for me automatically. Gone are the days of trying to keep a checkbook up-to-date when entries are missing; the automatic downloads from my financial institutions keep track it all. I don't keep up a checkbook register and even though I have duplicate checks, I rarely look at them since a copy of the check is available online at my financial institution. I can access the check copy online and update that information in the Quicken transaction. Reconciling bank statements is a breeze. I go online to my financial institutions to confirm the balance of each account and enter the balance in Quicken and click a button to compare downloaded transactions checkmarked as cleared. Like I said, I no longer spend a lot of time and frustration watching my finances with Quicken Essentials.

Received excellent service on my product delivery and selection. Received the product within the specified delivery date in the condition stated on the advertisement. I recommend this service to anyone wishing to purchase this product or any products offered by this merchant.
The product was great but as the title says the shipping charges were "outrageous".  This was a product - an empty box containing one data disc and a light weight plastic tray - almost $9.00 for shipping. ????

When I bought this item I didn't realize that the seller was in Hawaii as I'm on the island of Antigua a land mass and more miles to the east. The item arrived as if I had ordered it from Florida and was in perfect condition. The price was extremely reasonable and I would recommend the product and the seller to anyone.
Installed this product and I love to use it. Good, Good, Good, Good, Good, Good, Good, Good, Good, Good, Good.
The product is excellent, I just updated from 2008 ver. skipping one year.
I bought here because it includes the new unopened box and CD.I always buy from the lowest seller and reward them for driving the price down. I want to encourage the greedy sellers to lower their price. But only the True leader of the lowest price should get the sale. NOT the coward that matchs price.
Turbo Tax is a great tax tool but finding one at a good price is usually the most difficult thing to do.  I looked at the box stores' offers and was not impressed.  PC Galaxy offered the best deal through Amazon for price and shipping.  I received a new unopened Turbo Tax Deluxe within days of ordering with standard shipping. Their price with shipping was still below the box store's best prices.  I'll be back next year.
Turbo Tax was here promptly. when contacting the seller they promptly responded. product was delivered in Great condition. It was the same as buying it in the store just cheaper in price
Product was delivered timely and as promised. My only comment is that I found it cheaper at a local store after purchase from Amazaon.

This is more expensive than any comparable product but the headaches it saves makes it well worth it. We own a lot of stocks and bonds and have a lot of trades. Listing all of those trades on schedule D was a pain. Using this software I was able to import the trades from my broker. That saved me lots of time and spared me from doing a bunch of tedious and boring work.
That I was able to do my own taxes without a CPA and in the economic crunch this product is well worth the money and it really makes you realize where yur money is going and where you should be saving more or less with the way things are going.

OK, its an accordion file and they supply the labels. But for folks like me who keep all their receipts and other papers in one big messy bin, this accordion file is very useful. It helps you to get all the right papers sorted out, has neat little labels, and keep the papers together. You can pull just the papers you need out of that bin for tax time, and leave the rest in the bin for later.
And getting it for free, hey, I am not complaining!

Takes a little work to figure it out but with the help of an accountant it more than gets the job done and makes it simple. Cuts down the time I have to spend doing my book work too.
Makes my accounting very sample I do save money I spend little time.
A must for any small business.
Great product, fast access!
QBOL has saved me a lot of time.

I have had Quicken for financial purposes since I was a boy. I am 68 years old. Having just up-dated to the 2014 version, the product is so very similar to what I had from 2011 as to be pretty indistinguishable. Well, maybe the font is little big, but we all need to be flexible.

The upgrade involved migrating 74,567 transactions; would that make me near top of the list? The changeover took all of fifteen minutes or so. Now I realize in this day and age that might be unacceptable, but I got a little nap in and felt fit as a fiddle afterward.

Indeed, I was fearful of all these rumor mongers predicting the end of time, at least as far as my money was concerned. But it went fine, it really did. Perhaps I am just lucky or have a bit of patience. What chagrins me is this apparent mind numbing need to do your business while you are walking down the avenue or having dinner with a delightful woman. I recommend keeping your money matters to yourself, doing them in private, in your home, by yourself, preferably in your underwear. Let's face it, you are boring enough without "managing your finances" in front of or even in the presence of other people. Trust me, you are not that interesting.
I remember the days of my Dad doing taxes on the dining room table it took a week and we were not allowed to go in there or talk to him while he was doing them.... every night after work he would punch away on a calculator in frustration... as I child I dreaded the thought of having to one day do my own taxes... Thank you Intuit for Turbo Tax wow 30whole mins of my time BAM refund and DONE!!!  Seriously unless you are Rainman this is a must have for tax time.

Thank you! Thank you! for this wonderful,blessed, and so helpful program. I know my boyfriend loves me because by sharing this he's contributing financial independence to my life plus the knowledge in how technology is a blessing and agreat contribution to our lives and for our future family's lives, such as this. If this has been working for my honey Kam then I for sure know it'll help me. This is coming from a woman who wants to have control and be independently involved in my financial affairs of my life. Quicken fits perfectly into my catergory of life for personal use. I also heard and love quickbooks but that program does not work for me in what I need in my life.
Thank you!!!
Death and taxes are 2 known certainties in life ... but my deepest heartfelt thanks to Intuit for making the latter more agreeable to deal with as an ex pat living outside the US with an occasional life event that somehow manages to get proficiently addressed via your software package.  Reducing the complex to simplicity is the achievement of this software, please never lose sight of this goal.
Really like the look of the shifter and it fits with the theme of my Jeep (old school).  I used it on a Hurst shifter base (the lever that it came with was leaned way over and it was hitting my console).

The Lokar shifter was made to use m8 socket cap bolts, and the Hurst is threaded for 3/8-24 bolts. So, I had to drill out the shifter lever for the bigger bolt, and get some longer bolts and nuts to back them up.

I'm very pleased with the way it turned out and like how much taller the shifter is compared to the original Hurst one.
What can I say, I have used TurboTax since it came out on floppy discs.  Strayed once and came right back.
Happy Happy Joy Joy! It was just as it was advertised, so it gets four stars, what else is there to say! They would get five stars if they went above and beyond what was advertised and expected.

Imagine if your grocery store was like this and you had to rate every product you purchased! How annoying would that be?
Other than the fact that TurboTax has become much more expensove than it shoud be, I still find it to be the best solution for tax time.  Pending the arrival of the flat tax, it's the best alternative I have found and I've tried several of them.  I must say the I miss Parsons Technologies.

I don't have the PRO 2015 yet. I just upgraded mine to the PRO 2014. That was before the 2015 came out. In any event, I have been using QuickBooks continuously since 1999 and so far, I find it to be, if not the best, one of the best programs of any type, technology has ever put on the market. It is just wonderful"

I would definitely recommend this to anyone who owns a mac, I aren't found anything that I couldn't do! Thanks to everyone at intuit.
Not the easisest piece of software to understand but definitely does the job. If you are unfamiliar with the product get the "Dummies" guide.
i could handle tax return by myself. i was recommended by my friend. i would recommend to other friends someday.
Every year I utilize TurboTax. Again, very happy with the software and the ease of use. Do my taxes as well as some within the family with the software each year. Highly Recommend.
The product arrived as promised. The software was easy to follow. I will definitely recommend it to friends and family.
I guess this software is a proven entity.  wasn't as easy to go thru and program the date. Ihad to get help from
a friend. the instructions could have been better for an absolute beginner.plus I got the wrong software for me.
the description was not as precise as it should have been for a beginner.
I was very pleased with my TurboTax software. The software is self-explanatory and is very easy to use. I highly recommend this product for anyone who wants to prepare their own income taxes.
It suits my needs for financial software, without all the bells and whistles. It seems to be fairly stable and printing checks is easy with this software. I heartily reccomend it to everyone looking for "checkbook" software.
Have been a TurboTax user for many years.  Very easy to navigate the software.  With any software, though, I highly recommend checking your completed forms thoroughly before filing.
Just what I was looking for and at the price that I was looking for also recomend this to anyone........ Thanks

I purchased the Motorola Moto G5 Plus phone.  I like the phone very much, but the charger is faulty.  The end that plugs into the phone is so loose that it falls out with the slightest movement.  I plugged it into my old phone and it was the same, so I know it is the charger and not the phone. I plugged it in one night and in the morning the phone was not charged.

I like the fact I can sync with my phone and not have to worry about losing the receipt. I can take a picture of my receipt and when I sync my phone to my computer it attaches it to the transaction.
3/13/14 Works well on PC & less so on iPhone 4s. Rev 7 improved functionality in register displays and interaction with imported transactions.  Particularly like IDEA of the new photograph your receipt/document with the Mobile App, BUT even with Rev 7, it DOES NOT WORK reliably...enter transaction, take photo, then exit smartly to the phone's home screen! [transaction lost :-( ] Work around is to take photo in Camera Roll, then access photo from Quicken Mobile to attach to transaction.  You can then delete the photo from Camera Roll to save space...cumbersome, but it works  Couple of problems with Mobile App: 1.  Memo line cannot be accessed on iPhone 4s because it appears too low on the screen (it was accessible on 2013);  2.  Would be nice to be able to Split expenditure Categories directly, without having to access after entering the item.
I'm really impressed with some of the new features on Quicken 2014.  I especially like the mobile app and the capability to post on it and update the desktop.  I also like the ability to take a picture of receipts and keep with the purchase
I've not been able to find any of the bugs or problems indicated during other user reviews from December 2012 time frame. The data on my phone/tablet/pc all synchronize without issues.

WHAT IT NEEDS:
If the mobile [Android] app allowed you to take pictures of your receipts. This would allow me to enter a transaction and attach my receipt to upload/synchronize with my Desktop software.

Currently I have to rely on using the Android App "Cam Scanner" to create receipt images on the go, or when home I have to use my print/scanner. If Intuit added this feature it would skip a lot of steps for their users.

Overall, very happy so far.
The feature in the new Quicken 2014 mobile app that allows you to snap and store receipts is awesome. You have to buy the Quicken 2014 desktop program to use the Quicken 2014 mobile app.  You snap a picture of your receipt with your mobile phone and it will attach itself to the associated spending entry on the Quicken mobile app.

When you sync the mobile data to the desktop data, the receipt's picture is automatically attached to the correct spending entry on the desktop program and stored in the Quicken Cloud, which can then be downloaded to your desktop.  I like to use the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Xerox-Mobile-Wi-fi-Scanner/dp/B0070J9GOU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Xerox Mobile Wi-fi Scanner</a>&nbsp;with my iPhone to get a really good pic of the receipt. That works in the Quicken 2014 app as well, since it will allow you to attach any picture stored on your phone to your spending entry.  It's a very efficient way to keep track of your receipts, especially for business expenditures.

This is a lot better than the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/NeatReceipts-Mobile-Scanner-and-Digital-Filing-System-PC/dp/B001CQFRPO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">NeatReceipts Mobile Scanner and Digital Filing System - PC</a>&nbsp;system since it is all on one app.  The Neat Receipts system requires a lot of steps and a lot of time to attach a picture of a receipt to your spending entry in Quicken.  Their mobile photo system is similar to the Quicken system in that it puts the receipt in the Neat cloud, but it also requires a rather expensive monthly subscription.

My only hesitation about Quicken 2014 is that there are very few other new features in the upgrade, so if the receipt picture feature is not important, then I'm not sure it would be worth the upgrade price, especially if you are upgrading from Quicken 2013.
First, I really like the cloud capabilities.  The synchronization and reports sent to my smartphone are very useful.  I am just now starting to play with the rules, and I have a feeling that this is the feature that will really accelerate the tasks that I do with my finances. I was on the fence as to whether or not I would upgrade or skip this one.  I'm really glad I did.
I have really enjoyed using quickbooks online.  I like that I can get to it anytime and anywhere even if I have forgotten my computer.  I can pull it up on any device from my phone, ipad, or computer.  That is very convenient!!
Finally Quicken has figured a way to sync my account to all my other devices.  Now, I don't have to lug my laptop around when I travel as I can input all my receipts to my iPad or iPhone and then sync it to my laptop (my main location) when I get home.  Thanks Quicken.
I have been using Quickbooks for Mac for several months. I have no prior Quickbooks experience. I found it easy to use and very helpful. It seems virtually impossible to mess up--- things can easily be added, deleted, and moved. It has been very useful being able to track my business progress via Quickbook. I don't know what I would have done without it. My only complaint is the fact there is not a mobile phone app for mac users. It is kind of crazy to have an iphone app available for windows users--- but not mac users--- really?! I hope this will be corrected soon. Having a mobile app that syncs with my computer would quickbooks really ROCK!

I have been using QuickBooks Pro since 1998 and have used it for three small businesses. Its functions are intuitive and more than adequate for my needs.
QuickBooks is the market leader in small business accounting packages. I am amazed at its diverse clientele. I have seen it being used in tractor supply stores, doctor's offices, computer consultants, non-profits, and many others. Someone is probably already using QuickBooks in a business like yours. If at all possible get a book specific to your industry or ask your accountant how to setup your accounting so that it is effective and efficient.
I am writing this review at this time because I am purchasing a copy of QuickBooks for our local Habitat for Humanity affiliate. Most of the affiliates in the US already use QuickBooks. The national office has already written up procedures for setting up QuickBooks to manage the local affiliate's accounting. The combination of existing procedures, several volunteers with QuickBooks experience, and some additional functionality over Peachtree has made a compelling argument for the affiliate to change over to QuickBooks.

Quickbooks Payroll Service is ideal for small business applications.  I use it for 3-employees at a local cemetery in conjunction with Quickbooks for bookkeeping.  Everything is easily accessible, service is user-friendly and extremely cost effective for the small business owner.  For persons starting a small business and considering paying for an outside payroll service, Quickbooks Standard Payroll (or the service) is highly recommended as a cost-effective service as well as an educational tool for training personnel in payroll/human resources aspects.  I've used Quickbooks in a construction business and that's why when asked what software to purchase for the bookkeeping & payroll for a local cemetery, I immediately suggested Quickbooks.

Thanks for making my job easier with Quickbooks Pro 2006 & Standard Payroll Subscription.

I am a CPA and Certified QuickBooks ProAdvisor.  I provide training via classes and one-on-one in the Denver, Colorado area.  I also do training seminars for various groups throughout the nation.

QuickBooks Pro is an excellent small business accounting package.  It works for most small businesses from single owners to companies large enough to have up to 5 people working in the program at the same time.  You can purchase licenses up to 5 users.

When set up properly and with data entered properly the management reports are excellent.  Management reports are very important for all businesses.  For a new business, it lets you know your income and costs so you can determine where to put your marketing efforts and concentrate on getting your business going and growing.  For established businesses the aforementioned also applies.  However, after using QuickBooks for a period of time you will be able to look at reports related to the history of your business.  Good reports lead to better management decisions.

Many of the functions are simple to follow.  You enter a check in the software just like you were entering a check on paper.  QuickBooks has some built-in controls to help you enter transactions properly.  It even has a very good tutorial to help you get started.  And if you need help, you can find help from QuickBooks ProAdvisors in your area.  Also many cities have schools that offer QuickBooks classes to help you get started on the right track.

If you need to prepare proposals, quotes or estimates, QuickBooks has an excellent method for doing so.  You can even do progress invoicing from the proposals and estimates.

Payroll is often a challenge for small businesses.  QuickBooks has a payroll system (for an extra fee) that will integrate and make your life a whole lot easier in tracking and paying payroll taxes.  I know, I did payroll the old-fashioned way for many years.  I have yet to have a problem with QuickBooks payroll and I have been using it for almost 3 years.
As a small business accountant, I have used a variety of accounting software programs including QuickBooks, Peachtree, etc. Of all the programs I have used QuickBooks is the easiest for non-accountants to use. It's also the easiest for non-accountants to screw up. Therein lies the problem. QuickBooks does not teach you accounting. It provides you with a framework to keep track of your records. When it's set up and maintained correctly, it provides a business owner with tons of valuable data on the health of your business. I recommend QuickBooks very highly but I suggest that business owner's get help from a pro when they're setting up their company. I have spent numerous billable hours cleaning up poorly set up companies. Although that's great for MY business, it's not good for yours. It's much cheaper for you to start out with the right framework and training. Understanding the numbers side of your business is crucial to your success but don't expect a software program to be the magic bullet that teaches you everything you need to know. QuickBooks is a great tool and all my regular clients use it most successfully with a little help from their friendly accountant.

I use TurboTax year after year, never fails to deliver results, the user interface improves year to year, great product I will buy it aging next year.
Sucked in last year's info, used the online retrieval of 1099 info from a few accounts, and with no fuss or muss was done with mine and two of my neighbors in minimal time.
Purchase every year to do my taxes. Meets my needs and imports important information from the previous year.
I have used TurboTax for years, having suffered ever increasing accountants' fees (I own several rental apartments).  I thought from the start that it is wonderfully user friendly; nevertheless, they have managed to improve that friendliness year by year.  Of course, not having ever experienced an audit, I cannot speak dispositively about its accuracy and completeness...
The format seems to change from year to year.  To the extent that you can be consistent it would be appreciated!
This is my third or fourth year in a row using TTax. Love it! I is very user-friendly, and simply works!
I have used TurobTax for many years and have always felt comfortable with the program.  My only reason for a four-star rating is this year, I had to reenter all my personal history and none of my last year's data transferred to this year.  Apparently this was a problem with many other people.  I hope this problem will be corrected for next year.  If it fails next year I may look for another tax program.
This is my 4th year in a row using it. It is extremely user friendly.
We have been using Turbo Tax since the early 90s (or the second year of sales) and would never consider using any other method, - person, other software, business - to handle our taxes.  The product has only gotten more user friendly year after year.  The research behind the scenes to look at all the complicated changes in the law and put them into people-speak is tremendous.  Taxes easly as usual.
TT 2007 works as well as all the previous annual editions. (To be fair, though, TT got its best performance and GUI "user friendliness" boost when Intuit bought JK Lassiter - likely for its tax package - I've been a repeat user since the JKL days.) The TT import function allows easy carryover from previous years, and - as a small business owner - I really appreciate the utility of the Sched C dialogue. The two biggest drags with TT products are (1) you can't open a previous year return in this year's TT - meaning, if you ever want to open an old return, you'll have to keep that year's version operable (so, since you don't know which year you may want to open, you'll have to keep ALL previous years' versions operable - a super waste of disk space), since you can reinstall but you can't get the necessary updates for that year as downloads (TT does not maintain the update files past three years); and (2) saving files - this is not at all a well-designed function: you'll need to try this several times to get the right mix of forms and files saved in both "ttx" (TT) format and PDF format.

It took 10 minutes to download the installer, download the product and install the product (Emachines - Celeron, 1GB, WinXP, Broadband cable).
Product runs great.
Always be mindful when reading reviews with complaints about download issues or software performance that the issue is often not the download site or the software (hardware, connection speed, other processes running, etc all contribute to the experience).
Download - ran download through IE with no issues, running Norton antivirus with no issues.  Disabling a firewall when downloading a product is not unusual.
Product performance - My system setup (above) has no issues running the software.  The splash screen will display during startup while the software searches for updates, so the length of time the splash screen shows is dependent on many factors, one of which is the internet connection.  If you experience what feels like a hang, disable the automatic update.  Without the auto update turned on TT started within 10 seconds on my Celeron system.
So I highly recommend the software, but if you do anything on the internet you should have a broadband connection.  Dial-up is no longer an option with the amount of data that needs to be transferred, even with simple web surfing, especially as sites become more and more graphics intensive.

I've been using QuickBooks since 1999, having owned QuickBooks 99, 01, 2003 and 2006.  I'm by no means a QuickBooks expert, however.  I reluctantly bought the 2010 version since my 2006 version is no longer supported and I was starting to have some issues.  I'm running Windows 7 64 bit on an Intel Core i7 920 machine with 6GB of DDR3 RAM.

The purchase process did not go smoothly.  I wanted to use my business credit card for the purchase and added it, but Amazon still charged it to my personal card.  That's more of a complaint with Amazon and not QuickBooks, however.

I wasn't able to download the product immediately.  I received a message that the "process was taking longer than expected" with instructions that an email would be sent when the product was ready to be downloaded (about fifteen minutes later).  The download itself went fairly smoothly.  The 467 MB file only took a few minutes on my high-speed Comcast cable internet connection.

After downloading it, however, I ran into a problem with the installation.  It stalled during the installation of MSXML 4.0.  I made note of the suggestion by a previous reviewer to download a copy directly from Intuit (which I did), however I wanted THIS copy to work and was determined to make it do so.  Since the problem appeared related to MSXML 4.0, I downloaded a copy directly from Microsoft.  I let the MSXML 4.0 installation package remove what the QuickBooks package installed then installed a fresh copy of MSXML 4.0.  I noticed that the UAC popped up a few times requesting permission to install at various times and I think this is what was causing the QuickBooks install package to stall since it didn't ask.  Once the MSXML 4.0 installation was done, I reattempted the Amazon copy of the QuickBooks installation and finished successfully.

Since the problem appears to be permission-related, I would recommend right-clicking on the downloaded Amazon file and select "Run as administrator."  That may solve the permissions problem.  I may do a test install on my other Windows 7 computer and see if it goes smoothly.  If so, I'll edit this review and update it with the results.  Otherwise, Google "download MSXML 4.0" and you'll be able to download and install MSXML 4.0 (SP2) directly.
I have two computers, one older than the other. The older is my main desktop, the other a laptop. I've used TurboTax for 14-15 years with no installation problems. For some reason this year, TurboTax absolutely refused to load onto the desktop. I tried several times to no avail. I finally called TurboTax support and talked to a live person (would you believe a live person??). However this live person knew absolutely nothing about my installation problem. Finally he said, "I'll transfer you to tech support...." I waited and waited and waited.....no tech support. I hung up and tried the live person routine again. This time another agent seemed more helpful with several suggestions....none worked. He, too, said, "hang on, I'll transfer you to tech support," I could hear him asking around for the tech support number, then some muffled voices, then the phone went dead. He lost me (after more than an hour on the phone!!) I never got the problem resolved. I crossed my fingers and tried to install TurboTax on my laptop and voila, it worked. I love TurboTax, but can't say the same for their support staff.
Most of this review relates to Intuit customer service (everyone has their own views and expectations on the software itself - I've been a Quicken user since Money folded, and TurboTax user forever now and it works well for  what its worth. As someone said, what are the options?!).

So as is claimed, all known major issues with the outrageously buggy 2013 release have been fixed in the R10 update. So hopefully thats a consolation. However, the one issue I encountered upfront was that 2013 failed to recognize my file's password. Apparently thats an unofficially known issue as well, if the file password is >14 characters. The known solution is to reinstall 2010 version, temporarily remove file's password and upgrade back.

My problem was I had misplaced my 2010 install CDs. Contacted Quicken support via web chat and they instantly put the download version of 2010 software in my online Downloads section. Very quick to grasp the issue and quick, no-hassle response. The frustration I experienced with the unrecognized passwd itself and the loss of time was made up (at least in principle) by the prompt customer service.

For those experiencing this issue, try this route (they also have an online password removal service, but I'd personally rather not do that). Better yet, if you find out ahead of time, remove the passwd before upgrade and save yourself the time.
TurboTax 2011 Deluxe will install Microsoft .Net Framework 4.0 if it is not already installed.  This information os based on an install on Windows XP with Service Pack 3:

Summary: If using Microsoft Security Essentials, TURN IT OFF before allowing TurboTax to install Microsoft .Net Framework 4.0 to avoid the following problem:

Details of what happened during install:
1) TurboTax Deluxe 2011 tried installing Microsoft .Net Framework 4.0 but encountered an unspecified error (Microsoft Security Essentials was running),

2) After the error, it started on a 4 step process to try to correct the error, and this process ran for at least 15 minutes,

3) however, the process did not succeed and returned an error message to that effect.  There was also a link to get more information on the error.  When clicking on that link, it opened a "Solution Notification Signup" page on Intuit's site saying that they currently do not have a solution to the error that was encountered, prompting for your name, email and phone number in order to be notified when they do have a solution,

4) I decided to skip that and restart the PC and try the install again,

5) On rebooting and re-startup, I received an error box for "Microsoft Security Client" with an error code (0X80040154).  I checked and found that Microsoft Security Essentials was not running after this reboot and error,

6) I restarted the TurboTax Deluxe 2011 install, and this time, the Microsoft .Net Framework 4.0 install completed successfully (fairly quickly), and after that the remainder of the TurboTax Deluxe 2011 install completed without any errors,

7) Before running the TurboTax Deluxe 2011 Updates, I reopened Microsoft Security Essentials from the start menu (I did not have to reinstall the program), and it restarted without any problems,

8) just to be sure, I rebooted the PC again, this time Microsoft Security Essentials opened and ran normally, and I then reopened the TurboTax Deluxe 2011 program, and updated and ran the program without any problems.

If any further problems develop, I will post an update to this review.  This might also happen with other antivirus security programs, but I am not able to check or verify that.
It was with some concern that I decided to upgrade to 2016 from 2014 but I took the plunge the install went without a hitch but when I went to open quicken it wouldn't let me get passed the Intuit login screen kept giving me an unknown error message. I got a little concerned but gave the customer service chat a try and with in a couple of minutes (Saturday of a holiday weekend) I was connected to a tech who said that it was a known problem with installs on some machines and gave me a link to a mondo patch which I ran and surprise it worked!
The 2016 version came up without a hitch no problem with the conversion of data and it runs quite a bit faster that the old version and down loading from banks worked well so far I really have nothing but good thing to say about the new version and props to the customer support folks.
Ok... I am using Vista, and have been successful, so don't be too scared by the other posts.  I did, however, have a problem with this download.  For whatever reason, after waiting for it to download, I tried to install it and it informed me that the file was corrupt and needed to be downloaded again.  Not knowing for sure whether the problem would repeat itself, I instead went to the Intuit download site and downloaded it from there ([...]).  You'll still need to purchase it from here to get the good price (the price on the Intuit site is $[...]), but when I downloaded from there, the install went fine.

So, my recommendation.... buy it for cheap here to get your product and registration key, but download it from Intuit!
When I installed it I had the same password problem others have reported.  My suggestion is to delete your password prior to upgrading to Quicken 2016 and once installed add the password to the new version.  I was fortunate to have Quicken 2013 on two computers and installed Q2016 on one of them only to have it reject the password.  After starting the Intuit Password Recovery process through Intuit (Major PITA) I realized that if I removed the password on Q2013 there couldn't be a password problem when installing Q2016.  That worked!  I had backed the file up on several devices so I wasn't worried about losing data.  Intuit never suggested this simple solution which would have saved many hours of our time.
I have read many reviews about problems with the upgrade and I almost didn't make the purchase due to those reviews. However, I proceeded to make the purchase anyway and I can honestly say the upgrade was very smooth and was complete in less than 5 minutes. All information was there and all financial institution connections were working just fine. The only problem I did have was the update to Release 4. For some reason it kept failing but once I manually got rid of the update file and downloaded it manually everything was fine. Probably just a file that got corrupted during the automatic download which prevented the update to install successfully - nothing that couldn't be fixed manually. Al in all I don't have any of the problems I see other reviewers reporting.

Every time Intuit updates QB for Mac, it gets a little better and a little more user friendly. I do have a few problems with it, though.
1 - They have changed the placement options for the toolbar. You can no longer keep it at the top or bottom of the screen, only the left or right. You also cannot completely hide it like the Mac dock. You also cannot keep it in the fully open position. These are all annoyances for me as I prefer the toolbar to be at the top of the screen and hidden until I need to use it, at which time I want it to be immediately available. I have written to Intuit and they claim that it is too problematic to make that option possible, and that most of their customers prefer this new set up. I'm not buying it, but that's what they claim.
2 - They still have done NOTHING to improve the Layout Designer. It's extremely awkward to use, and there are times when I spend hours setting up a template but my changes aren't saved the way I set them or they print differently than they look on screen. (And yes, I did save my changes!) My biggest problem is with the fonts, particularly setting the page number font. I was able to choose a font several versions ago, but now there is absolutely no way to correct or change it. The strange thing is that when I went into Layout Designer again to try to fix it, it screwed with the font in another field in the layout, and now that field's vertical alignment is off and it copied the font style and size from the page number (that I have been trying to change). No matter how many times I try to set the correct font in that field, it still prints the page number font.
3 - In the Write Checks or Write Credit Card Charges windows, if you're not careful, you may end up typing over a previous entry, if that's what you had been looking at previously. Also, the Recalc button is now in an awkward location. And the date always defaults back to Today's Date, even if I am entering older receipts. Also, if you sometimes enter check info by item, as I do for some checks, it defaults back to the expenses tab. Intuit claims that if you have previously entered that vendor using the items tab, it should remember that and open a new check with that tab showing, but that only happens sometimes.
4 - There were no clear instructions that came with the upgrade that show step by step instructions on the new features.
5 - I'm tired of calling customer service and getting agents who are clearly not from this country and honestly can't understand exactly the problem I'm trying to explain. Although they do speak English, there are connotations that are lost on them, and they are often very rude and abrupt. There are exceptions to this, as my last conversation with one of these agents was very positive. He was very knowledgable and polite. But this has not been the general rule.

I know I have pointed out all the negatives, and I'm sure there are other changes that I have forgotten to write about, but honestly, aside from these poorly thought out modifications, the program seems to be an improvement overall.
When entering security purchases, if the price times the number of shares doesn't match the total dollars (because one or the other was entered incorrectly), the program wants to default to the total dollars being correct, and I think that is the worst choice.  Preference would be for it to simply tell you there is an error and allow you to fix it.

The other complaint is that when you ask to reconcile a brokerage account that doesn't have a matching cash account, the program defaults to today's date as the date of the statement.  I have never seen that be correct, and think the program should always default to the last day of the prior month.  Infinitely more likely to be correct, and always changeable if it isn't.
I have owned every version of Quicken since DOS. Generally, I like it a lot. Just a few things I wish they would fix. I would like to be able to adjust the size of the "tag" column with the two-line display. It only can be changed now using the single-line display. Also, when the "category" box pops up during entries, it goes to the top of the page, and the first choices are off the screen. That's a big bummer, requiring me to back out of accepting a new downloaded entry entirely, and then manually lower the register to a position near the bottom of the screen, in order to be able to see all the category choices.

edit
Does what I need of it.  However, some of the screens such as the default "Main View" have drop-down lists.  Some of those drop-down lists such as the one for "Bill & Income Reminders", is not wide enough & does not seem to be adjustable.  I then created a new "View" & on it I placed the Bill & Income Reminders table & it is wider than needed, but again, is not adjustable.  "Main View" cuts off the arrow button where you choose Enter to Register, Skip, or Edit.  If it were 3 characters wider, it would all fit.
I have been a Quicken user for well over 10 years and this is probably one of the best releases they have done. With multiple accounts, reconciling is still a minor problem. If you change any entry in any account, all of the same entries change in all accounts. Finding that error can be a problem. What I have done to solve that was to red flag the entry containing the reconciled amount. On the same entry in the "memo" line, I add Balance OK (the amount).This amount is the same for the reconciled amount. The two numbers must match. So in memo, you might have Bal OK ($121.00) And balance column you would have 121.00. If you change an entry in any account, the balance column entry won't match the entry in the parentheses.
If the two numbers don't match, then you have changed an entry somewhere on one of your accounts. Scroll up the entries until you find a red flagged entry that matches the reconciled amount. Your mistake will be found between the matching entry and the non-matching entry. At least you won't have to search through thousands of entries. Good luck.
I'm running Quicken 2008 (Q08) under 32-bit Vista Ultimate.  I had no problem with the installation except that it adds 4 icons to my desktop without asking.  As part of the installation, Quicken asks if it should get updates.  Right now, R2 (increasing the cryptography key length) is available, so you should say yes.  Upon first entering the program, it asks about data.  I told it to use my existing data on the disk and it found it under the Documents folder without trouble.  It converted my Quicken 2005 (Q05) data to the Q08 format and stored a copy of my old stuff in another directory.  It also noticed that I had been using Quicken Premier and offered to unlock the Premier stuff (for a fee, I assume).  It then asked if I wanted to register now or later.  Afterwards, it showed me information about various new things that might help the upgrade process.  As for the program, other than the summary screens, it doesn't seem that much different from Q05.  A few tweaks.  But, it pretty much feels the same.  I had quite a bit of trouble with the Q05 under Vista.  Those problems seem to be fixed now.

One positive thing is that my file size for Q08 is much smaller than that for Q05 (others on-line say they don't see much of a difference).  For my two QDF files, one went from 28MB to 17MB, and the other went from 15MB to 7MB.  It's possible the difference could be from data fragmentation in the old files while the newly converted versions are still compact from the conversion process.  But, that's an awfully big difference.

Coming from Q05, I'm finding Q08's window scrolling using the mouse scroll wheel to be a bit random.  I never noticed this in Q05.  Basically, I can never tell whether the scroll wheel on my Logitech MX600 Cordless Laser Mouse will actually scroll on any given window.  In Q05, the scroll wheel worked whenever the mouse cursor was even hovering over the frame in question.  Now, I sometimes have to click on the frame to get the scroll wheel to work.  Plus, it looks like merely clicking in the border of the frame isn't enough.  I actually have to click in the scrollable area.  I haven't been able to pin down the behavior yet since something won't work one time but will the next time.  The problem is compounded since Quicken doesn't give any indication of which frame has the focus.

Also, Q08's "One Step Update" "To Do" list is a tad awkward to use.  By "To Do" list, I'm talking about the window (entitled "One Step Update Settings") that pops up after telling Q08 to do a "One Step Update" and entering the password.  Unfortunately, the list of planned things under the "Financial Institutions" section (which fit very nicely in Q05's box) no longer fits in Q08's.  To see everything, I have to scroll.  That leads to Q08's scrolling problem.  Unfortunately, since the necessary click has to be in the actual scrollable area of the "To Do" list, I've ended up de-selecting things when all I want to do is scroll the list.  The same scrolling problem happens on the Status list at the end of the update.  Another interesting thing is the "One Step Update Summary" screen after the update.  Down at the bottom, it has a section for what it did with Quicken.com.  That section is always collapsed.  It doesn't have much in it (just saying x accounts were synched online), but it ought to default to un-collapsed (especially when it contains info) or to whatever I set it to last time.

Intuit has also replaced Classes with Tags.  I don't see the point in the change:  they seem to work about the same.  One problem with Tags is that there's a Tag field in the Register instead of the Class just being appended to the Category.  That's no problem with only one Category.  But, if you have splits (which almost all my transactions do), then along with the Category field saying "--Split--," there's now a Tag field saying "--Split--" (and the Tag field's split isn't enterable or editable). All this seems to do is clutter up the Register.  It's possible to remove the Tag field from the Register entirely through the Options area.  As far as I can see, that lets Quicken function using the Class interface from previous versions (that's what I'm using).

Unfortunately, there are also problems with this version that have existed for years.  Things I've personally run into:
- since at least Quicken 2004 and possibly Quicken 2003, Quicken seems to randomly blank out the Maturity Date of CDs in the Security List and list them as 0/0/1900 in the Alerts Center.  There doesn't seem to be a way to delete these old Maturity Date alerts.
- since at least Q05, going to an investment account, loading up the Fundamentals screen, and then clicking on the "Industry Debt/Equity" header or the company's "Debt/Equity" header, the list of equities appears to sort.  But, the sort order is incorrect.  Sorting on any other column (that I tested) works fine.

I'm not sure if I should classify this as a new problem or an old, non-fixed one.  It involves Quicken Deluxe 2008's Billminder and new Sidebar Gadget.  Billminder has been around for a while and has always had problems either updating or even running.  The updating problem seems to still exist.  But, there's now a problem with reconciling Billminder with the new Sidebar Gadget.  I notice this when I reboot my computer and see that the boot-up Billminder display doesn't match the one I get when I run Billminder from the Sidebar Gadget. Neither of those displays match what the Gadget itself shows me.
I don't like to upgrade most of the time.  After reading most of the reviews, I was scared to upgrade.  I waited as long as I could.  I use it for all sort of business and home finances.  I don't like using my mobile for this information, so all the comments about how the mobile was quirky didn't bother me.  I only have 3 things that I think need improving.  1. You can't remove old accounts from the password vault.  I know you can just disable it from the download, but I still don't like seeing it in the list.  I had to set a new ID because the institution made me change the ID.  I don't really feel like killing the whole vault and then setting it back up again.  Intuit should be able to fix this easily.  2. When you download transactions, in the previous versions, you could click on the downloaded transaction and the date field in the register was highlighted.  You could then hit Enter or tab and it would go to the next field in the register to finish entering the transaction.  Now in this version, when you click on the new transaction in the download section, it writes the record to the register and the date field is highlighted.  But, when you hit Enter or tab, nothing happens.  You have to click on the date field with the mouse and then you can hit Enter or tab to move to the next field.  3. Auto complete on the Payee name shows up when you start typing (both versions).  As soon as the Payee shows up, in the old version, you could hit Enter and it would move to the value field.  Now when you hit Enter as the Payee shows, Payee is returned to the Payee field and you stop there.  You have to hit Enter again to move to the next field.  I know this is minor, but after entering thousands of transactions the old way, it kind of breaks the rhythm with this new version.  All else, look is good and still easy to use.
First time using TT and it was mostly painless.  However, there are bugs in handling sales of mutual funds.

1.  All of my sales were based on average costs, so purchase date was always "various" , which I dutifully entered for each one.  However, when I reviewed the forms, the 8949 form was showing a specific purchase date for 5 out of 8 sales.  I had to go back and RE-ENTER "various" for the purchase date.

2.  To make matters worse, the purchase date the program put in was the SAME as the selling date -- which makes no sense and should have raised a RED flag (even if I had accidently put in a date).  But the program ignored it.

3. Some of the sells created a small "wash sale" component which the broker showed on the form as "disallowed loss".  There seems to be a box on the step-by-step form for this correction, but when I put in a number, it was IGNORED every time.
Finally, I had to go into the actual 8949 form it had generated and put in the loss adjustments MANUALLY.

4. And even with these corrections, the final 8949 form was not completely correct.  The numbers were correct (after my manual corrections), but in column "b", there is supposed to be a code to explain the adjustment (in column g) -- in this case a "w" for "wash".  However, there seemed to be no way to enter the codes for column b in 8949.
I ended up filing it without the codes and hope the IRS isn't too picky.

Even though the program assured me it was 100% accurate, if I had not caught these errors, it would certainly have NOT been 100% accurate.

By the way, I double checked that I had all the current updates.

In handling rental property (Schedule E), the program assumes that if a given % of the property is rented, then all the expenses can be prorated by that % -- which is NOT always True.  For example, the amount of mortgage (if there is only one) can be different for the rental portion, depending on how the mortgage has been paid.
The work around was to tell it to use 100% factor and then HAND calculate the portion of each expense item for the rental part.

As a plus, it did seem to handle K-1 forms and entries correctly and also form 8582 passive loss and worksheets.
I have used Qucken for my personal checking for years & love it. My only complaint is in the check writing field it defaults to online payment and I have to un-check the box in order to fill in the check field with the address etc on every check. It should default the opposite sense you are more likely writing the physical check rather than an on-line bank draft.

There is a lot of confusion about this. The main distinction to note is that there is a difference between *preparing* a tax return and *e-filing* a tax return.

There is also a difference between *e-filing* a tax return and just *filing* a tax return using TurboTax : E-filing means the prepared tax return is submitted to the tax authority electronically. You can, if you wish, print the prepared tax return instead, put it in an envelope, and sent it to the tax authority by mail - this would be *filing* the tax return, as opposed to *e-filing*.

For the TurboTax Deluxe Fed + Efile + State 2013 software, you are paying for software which will enable you to *prepare* up to 5 Federal tax returns and and *prepare* up to 5 State tax returns for ONE state only.

When it comes to submitting the Federal tax returns, there is no e-filing fee - you can e-file up to 5 Federal tax returns electronically with this software, and there's no additional cost to do so. You can still print them out and mail them in if you wanted do, but I don't see why anyone would want to since e-filing the Federal tax returns is free, unless you have additional documentation the IRS require.

When it comes to submitting the State tax returns, you have two options:
(1) you can print out the prepared tax return, put it in an envelope, and mail it to your state tax authority, and the only cost would be the stamp to send it, OR
(2) you can *e-file* the prepared tax return via TurboTax, and there would be an e-filing fee of $19.95 per tax return to do so.
That's basically all there is to that.

There has also been comments about a $29.95 refund processing fee. I'll explain what I believe this fee is about. When you have finished preparing your state tax return and elect to e-file it for the $19.95 fee mentioned above, you have an option to pay that $19.95 fee online by credit card right there and then, or have it deducted from your state tax refund. If you pay by credit card right there and then, there should not be any return processing fee. If you instead elect to pay that $19.95 fee by having it deducted from your tax return, guess what - you're going to get hit with a $29.95 refund processing fee. That is what that fee is all about, I believe. Clearly it is better to pay the $19.95 by credit card right there and then, if you are able to.

Another point to note: if you need to file tax returns in more than one state, you will have to pay for additional software to *prepare* returns for those additional state(s) - I believe the cost is around $39.95 for each state, and that will allow up to 5 tax returns to be *prepared* (not e-filed) for each state purchased. You will still be subject to another $19.95 e-filing fee for each state return filed as well.

For the 2013 tax year, I am aware New York State are not charging an e-filing fee if your Federal AGI is under $58,000. Whether TurboTax will still charge the fee regardless I am not sure.

If this helped clarify the fee situation for you, please click YES next to the "Was this review helpful to you?" below, and maybe it will stay on top of the reviews list for others with the same questions. Any Intuit TurboTax staff reading this please comment if I've said anything incorrect here and I will amend it accordingly.
I just finished my taxes. One thing I will suggest for those having issues downloading state for extra $39.99 is to update state software, sign out of turbo tax and sign back in. State will be downloaded at no additional cost other than to e file state for $19.99. Those that claim its $19.99 plus $29.99 processing fee to e file state are not mentioning that the $29.99 processing fee is only if you want them to deduct the  $19.99 directly from your return. You can pay by credit card to e file and it will only cost $19.99, no processing fee. So my federal and state taxes are completed and both filed electronically for a total of $60.
I think that this is one of the best tax filing programs for individuals. It would be better if they included electronic filing for State Returns. As it is, you have to pay extra to file your state return electronically. The alternative is to print out your state return and mail it to your state tax center. This is still cheaper than what TurboTax charges you for electronically filing State returns but it is inconvenient and time consuming. If TurboTax would include electronic filing for State returns, I would give it 5 stars. PH 141001
I have read several reviews regarding the additional filing fees associated with a state tax return.  With this particular version of TurboTax the federal tax return can be e-filed for free and the state tax return can be e-filed for an additional $19.95 fee.  When setting up the e-file information you have the choice of having the $19.95 state e-filing fee deducted from your return or paid with a credit card.  If you choose to have the fee deducted from your return you are charged an additional $29.95 for using that particular feature.  If you choose to pay the state e-filing fee with a credit card you are not charged an additional $29.95.

Intuit should have described the fees and circumstances under which they are charged more clearly.  Other than that, I love TurboTax and have been using it for over a decade now.
I love TurboTax and purchase it from Amazon every year to file my taxes.  However, in the past years this software came with one free electronic filing of a state return and $19.99 for an additional state e-filed return.  It now costs $24.99 for each state return you file electronically.  I thought the idea was to encourage people to file electronically.  Since I have two state returns to file for our household, I am not about to electronically file the state returns.  I am not sure if these fees go to TurboTax or the state you are filing in but it's absurd.
I've used TurboTax for over 10 years and never been disappointed with its performance or ease of filing my taxes.  The Deluxe version gives you 1 free electronic filing of your federal taxes and includes a copy of your state taxes, however you do have to pay $19.99 to file your state taxes electronically through TurboTax.  There is no fee if you mail them.

Additionally, if your state is not a "stand alone" state that will accept state taxes e-filed separately from your federal taxes, you MUST file both federal and state taxes at the same time or the state taxes will be rejected as an electronic file and you will have to file them by mail which will take longer if you are expecting a refund.

Also, my federal taxes were accepted on January 29, 2014, which caused a glitch each time I would check on the status of my taxes as the TTax software kept telling me the acceptance date could not be before 1/31/2014 even though it notified me of my early acceptance on the 29th.  For this reason, and because my state taxes were rejected as an electronic file in my non-stand alone state when I filed them the next day and I had to mail them, I deducted 1 star above.  The program should make this clear before you spend the money to file your state taxes.

TurboTax did refund my state filing fee once they determined I could not file electronically and I had already paid the fee, even though they will tell you in chat that the $19.99 fee is not for e-filing but for processing your state form with the program.  I explained to them that if this were True,  it wouldn't be free to print and mail the state forms, i.e., if you don't select e-file, there is no $19.99 charge even though I used the program to do my state taxes.
Great product, but I think that when TurboTax advertises the Free Federal E-File, they should also emphasize that there is an additional State E-File fee. All I remembered from the purchase was that it was both Federal and State with a free E-File, not the details. Had to go back to the purchase and look up what's included which was Federal and State forms and a free Federal E-file, no mention of the State E-File, one way or another, so I assume it's not included since when filing I got a message about a $19.95 fee to file electronically through TurboTax. Now I know.
Worked well. Have used Turbo Tax for years with no real complaint. Only thing I do not like .... the fee to file state tax I feel is too expensive.  Why would I pay $19.99 to file state electronically when I only get $13 back for a refund.  This may be a state charged fee (NC) but I did not see an explanation for the fee.  It only popped up after I chose to file electronically.  One free federal and one free state would be nice in Deluxe (especially when only the download (no disc) option was purchased) ... would prevent having to go back in the program to print state return for filing by mail.  Or at least show in the program earlier, an option to avoid the fee by filing federal electronically for free and printing state forms for filing by mail for free.
The Federal return was easy to follow and complete.  The state return took a little bit more time to complete and was a bit more cumbersome.  The price for filing electronically should be clearly stated in the package literature. I was not aware of this additional cost until I had completed the return - note that the additional cost to file electronically applies to the federal and the state return.  I also experienced a $2.00 price increase (from $14.95 to $16.95) in the cost of filing electronically in the few days that it took me to review and submit the federal return.
Federal return was completed and filed without problems. Federal refund was received in four days. Wisconsin refund was received in five days. I also need to file Minnesota taxes. Turbo Tax insists I need to complete an additional form which involves redoing the federal. I've checked the MN IRS website and I do not have to file that form. Otherwise, I would rate the product with five stars.
