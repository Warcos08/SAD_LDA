Excelente juego. Es muy diferente a cualquier juego de v&iacute;deo. Obliga a pensar y a moverse, dos cosas que en los v&iacute;deo juegos son muy escasas. los gr&aacute;ficos son simples, pero no se necesita mas. la m&uacute;sica es muy adictiva y divertida. Claro esta que uno no aguanta jugar por horas este juego, pero si lo anima a jugar un poco todos los d&iacute;as para seguir avanzando y eso es muy bueno con los ni&ntilde;os que normalmente se quedan pegados a un juego por horas.

Shigeru Miyamoto created a masterpiece when he createdthe Mario Bros. series and this game is no exception.I first played Mario Bros. 2 during the late 1980's orearly 1990's and it was much better then Mario Bros.,it had better graphics, sound, gameplay and the enemiesand bosses as well as levels were much more interestingand trippy this time around.You could also play as either Mario, Luigi, Peach or Toad.I give this game 5/5 stars and thanks goes to my Mom for buyingthis game for me as well as my NES in the first place!;)Here is an excellent and detailed review which best sums upthis great game which I have edited and left SMB All Stars out.From:[...]There is only one way to describe Super Mario Bros. 2 . . . . And that word is: Odd.As the second game in the series, Mario Bros. 2 does exactly everything that you WOULDN'T expect from a sequel to the first game. It takes the characters in the Mario universe, adds them to a strange and quirky world, and then takes the gameplay of the first game and absolutely tips it on it's head.There are several design changes that factor in to making Super Mario Bros. 2 so different from the first game in the way it plays. First off is the elimination of the timer. Since there is no timer on any of the levels, you are no longer racing to try and finish the game as fast as you can. The second difference is the fact that you can go backwards in a level. In the original game, when the level scrolled, you could no longer go back in that direction (which made sense in Mario 1 because you are always racing to reach the end of the level before the timer runs out and you die, so there is no reason to go back).Thirdly . . . while Super Mario Bros. 1 popularized the aspect of a side-scrolling game, meaning that the screen scrolls to reveal a bigger playfield (instead of being confined to a single-screen as in games like Pac-Man or Galaga) it was still a game that was confined in the sense that you could only go forwards, you were forced to go forwards (even though you scrolled the screen yourself). Super Mario Bros. 2 changed all that by letting the scrolling of the level, either forwards or backwards, be completely up to the player.However the biggest change did not come from the aforementioned improvements, but rather from another improvement . . . one that you didn't really see much of in the first Super Mario Bros. This sequel let the player explore the world in a whole new way . . . a new dimension. And that dimension was vertically. Mario 2 opens up the whole notion of vertical gameplay to the player. Whether it's jumping onto platform after platform that are suspended in the air, or climbing vines or ladders, Super Mario Bros. 2 sends the player vertically just as often as you scroll left or right, which is a dramatic change.The combination of the lack of a timer, the ability to go backwards and the insistence of the levels in pushing you upwards, gives Super Mario Bros. 2 a COMPLETELY different feel as far as level design goes. And that vertical aspect comes into play as soon as you start the game and are immediately dropped from a door in the sky to the ground below you.Believe it or not, these are not the only changes that separate Super Mario Bros. 2 from it's prequel.But I'm getting ahead of myself here. First a look at some history. Although many do not know it, one reason that Super Mario Bros. 2 is so different from all the other games in the series is because it originally was not a Mario game at all! What we know in America as Super Mario Bros. 2 was actually a game that was only released in Japan. This game was developed by Nintendo and called Doki Doki Panic. Actually the full title is Yume Kj: Doki Doki Panikku which translates to Dream Factory: Doki Doki Panic.This quirky NES game was Mario-ized and brought to America and other regions as Super Mario Bros. 2. The Mario version was also later released in Japan as Super Mario USA.The real sequel to Super Mario Bros. was actually a game that was strikingly similar to the first game. Matter of fact it was really just a remixed version. It was much more difficult than the original and allowed you to play single-player as either Mario or Luigi, with both characters having different abilities (Luigi jumped higher but was harder to stop once he took off running). It also added the new Poisonous Mushroom (identified by their purple color) to the equation. If you grabbed a Poisonous Mushroom it'd harm you rather than help you.Nintendo of Japan however had a hard time deciding whether or not to release Super Mario Bros. 2 (Jap) in the US, fearing that it would be too difficult for American players (it was common in the Japanese video game world at that time to underestimate the abilities of American and European players, even though we had no problem with supremely tough games like Metroid or Contra).So they decided to take another game that they thought was easier (which is quite ironic, cause it's definitely not an easy game) and modify the game, making it into a Mario title to release in the US as Super Mario Bros. 2. The game was developed in cooperation with Fuji Television (who licensed the characters for Nintendo to use) to promote their Yume Kj '87 event in Japan, which showcased several of Fuji TV's latest TV shows and other products at the time. Doki Doki Panic featured the mascots of the Yume Kj festival (an Arabian family consisting of siblings Imajin and Lina and their parents, Papa and Mama) as its main characters and the rest of the characters, including the main villain, Mamu (Renamed Wart for the modified American version), were all original creations by Nintendo for the game.Doki Doki Panic takes place within a book with this Arabian or Indian setting (which explains the desert landscapes and Arabian-style sounding music) where all four characters are sucked into it's world. They are all playable as well, and the game is not completed until the player plays through the game as all four of them, unlike in the American remake.For the modified US version of Doki Doki Panic, Mario corresponds to the Imajin character, Princess Toadstool (or Peach as she's known now) corresponds to Lina, Luigi corresponds to Mama and the stout Papa corresponds to Toad.So Nintendo did all this modifying (leaving most of the game exactly the same, including the enemies and bosses and most of the music and sound effects) thinking that no American player would know the difference. And they were right. Unless you worked in the video game industry or for gaming publications and were in the know, then you'd never realize that what you were playing was not a "true" Mario game.Super Mario Bros. 2 (US) was widely accepted by the people that played it despite it's oddball flavor, and it become so popular and infamous for it's uniqueness that it actually became considered by Nintendo as the real Super Mario Bros. 2 and took it's place alongside the other core games in the Mario saga (Super Mario Bros. 1, 2, and 3, Super Mario World, Super Mario 64, etc.).And the elements of Super Mario Bros. 2 (US) that weren't originally Mario but Doki, such as the enemies like Bob-Ombs, Birdo and Shy Guy`s (who were unchanged from their Doki Doki Panic origins), actually became part of the Mario universe.Nowadays Birdo has developed more into a full-fledged Mario mascot character and taken his place alongside Yoshi; as is evidenced by her appearance as a Yoshi team-up character in Mario Kart: Double Dash on GameCube and in some Mario sports titles.Had Nintendo never converted Doki Doki Panic into a Mario game and released it as such in the US, then many of the beloved characters that people now love would never have existed. And that would definitely be a shame.So I for one am glad that we got this Nintendo game instead of the "real" Super Mario Bros. 2 [Jap] since it is much more unique and original than what we would have gotten, and the new enemies that came along for the ride ended up being great additions to the Mario family (The Japanese Super Mario Bros. 2 btw would later hit America for the Super Nintendo as part of the Super Mario All-Stars compilation, in which it was included as Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels)So . . . now getting back to the differences in gameplay between Super Mario Bros. 1 and this Super Mario Bros. 2 (US). Whereas the main form of attack in the original game is jumping on the heads of the various enemies, this game changed all that by allowing every enemy in the game (virtually) to be picked up and thrown. Matter of fact, there are no enemies in the game that can be destroyed by jumping on their heads! Your form of attack is now exclusively picking up and throwing. And it's not just enemies that you can pick up and throw at other enemies, but lots of other things as well. For example, the game is also littered with . . . . VEGETABLES! Veggies can be pulled out of the ground and hurled to kill enemies (All enemies in the game die with one hit outside of bosses) and you will find that they play a prominent role throughout the game. They appear in both small and large varieties.Super Mario Bros. 2 was also the first Mario game to introduce other playable characters, which was a huge change from the first game. In Super Mario Bros. 2 you can play as not only Mario and Luigi, but also the Princess and Toad. While both of the latter characters did appear in the first Super Mario Bros., it was really Super Mario Bros. 2 that popularized them and made legions of fans of those characters since it was our first shot at actually being able to play as them. And even though they were simply character swaps for the Doki characters, most people, like me, didn't know that as kids and took a personal liking to the Toad and Princess characters. I have always loved Toad ever since I played Super Mario Bros. 2 when I was about 5 years old. I thought the little guy was great (and I'm still holding out hope that he'll get his own spot as a playable character in Super Smash Bros. Brawl).Each character has their own abilities that make them useful in different situations. The speed at which they run or the height of their jump when holding an item, the speed at which they lift items, and the height of their jump all differs between characters.Mario (typical nowadays) is the "average" character, he doesn't really excel at any one ability. Luigi is the character with the highest jump, he's also the tallest character. Toad is the shortest of the bunch and also the quickest at running and lifting, but he also has the lowest jump. Princess on the other hand is the slowest lifter, but she has an ability that's completely unique to her character (and one she inherited for her debut in Super Smash Bros. Melee) . . . if you hold the jump button, she can FLOAT for a short time! This almost makes her a kind of unfair character as she really is a great choice no matter what level you are on cause you can almost always benefit from her floating ability.As for the other features of Mario, such as coins and items, everything in Super Mario Bros. 2 has been changed up or altered from the first game. Although the way you progress from level to level is still largely the same, as there are a number of worlds and each world has 3 levels, and it uses the same dash system, so world 2-2 would mean the second level on the second world. Pipes though, a major feature of the first Super Mario Bros. have been replaced with these objects that look like vases, some of which can be entered by pressing down, leading inside the vase, much like a pipe in the first game.You now have a life bar made up of hearts on the left side of the screen. If you lose all your hearts by getting hit, then the containers will empty and you will die. If you only have one heart then you are small. You start with two containers, and can get up to four in any one level (containers do not carry on to the next level).If you are small, then getting another heart or a Mushroom will make you grow. Mushrooms are the only way you can get another heart container, and you only find Mushrooms in what is known as "sub-con", which is basically another dimension of the world. Throughout the levels are a certain number of these red potions. You will pull them up from the ground like a vegetable. If you throw the potion, it will create a door. Enter that door and whatever is on the screen will turn dark to signify that you are in another dimension, in "sub-con".Sub-con is a big part of the game. Mushrooms, as well as coins, only appear in sub-con. But Mushrooms only appear in a specific spot. So to get that Mushroom, you are required to throw the door at the place where you think a Mushroom may be. While it's true that Mushrooms theoretically can appear anywhere in a level, they will generally appear in some obvious places, usually where you find many vegetables or something else to give you a hint. Vegetables in Sub-Con turn into coins (one veggie counts as one coin). Coins count towards how many tries you will have at the slot machine in between stages, where you can earn extra lives (and it is the only way to earn extra lives outside of some uncommon 1-Up Mushrooms that you will occasionally pull from the ground).The last big piece of the Super Mario Bros. 2 world are cherries. Cherries kind of take the place of coins in the previous Super Mario Bros., that is, while outside Sub-Con you will see cherries just floating in the air, as coins did in the previous game (actually, they aren't so much floating as nailed, literally, to the air). Grabbing enough cherries will summon a Starman, which works just as in Super Mario Bros. and will give you invincibility for a short amount of time.Super Mario Bros. 2 keeps a nice balance in the way the various game mechanics come into play. For example, unlike most games, the only way to heal yourself (outside a Mushroom) is by killing enemies, which will summon a heart to come floating onto the screen from below, collect it to fill a heart container. This helps in giving you a reason to actually kill enemies instead of simply running past them. You will also occasionally come across other items that you will pull from the ground. These include Shells, which you throw and jump on top of as they slide across the ground, killing any enemies in their path, Stop Watches, which you will pull from the ground once you've pulled 5 big vegetables. Stop Watches will freeze time for a short period. You will also occasionally come across "POW" blocks. These big black boxes will shake the screen once thrown and destroy any enemy that's touching the ground. POW's are still a really cool part of the Mario universe, although they haven't shown up as prominently since Super Mario Bros. 2. But they did make a cameo appearence in the first Super Smash Bros. on the Classic Mushroom Kingdom stage and they occasionally will pop-up in different Mario titles.The last real item you'll come across are bombs. Similar to in the Zelda series, you will come across bricks which can be blown up by using bombs. Bombs will explode a bit after you pick them up and you pull them from the ground like you would vegetables. Bombs will always appear near where they need to be used.And speaking of bombs, this segues into the almost puzzle like aspects of Super Mario Bros. 2. There are many points in the game where you will have to bomb walls or bricks in a certain way. For example, there may be a platform above a lower one, with breaks and walls that can be bombed, blocking the middle of the bottom platform. And if you go into sub-con a Mushroom will appear, but you may only be able to get that Mushroom if you have bombed the right spots.Early on you will come to a secret where you need to drop a bomb down a skinny area where a bombable wall is blocking the door. But it's only wide enough for your character and if you fall or climb down you don't have enough room to throw the bomb. So you gotta drop it from above, and the key is to wait for the bomb to flash and time your throw so that it blows up at the right time, destroying at least two blocks, which will give you enough room to fit in through the gap. And these types of little bombing areas are numerous.Unlike the original Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 2 is a lot more non-linear. You can pretty much complete the levels as slow or as quick as you want, for the reasons mentioned above, but also the world itself is also a lot more complex.The world in Super Mario Bros. 2 is full of doors. All the doors can be entered and exited by pressing the Up Button. And there is almost no point where you can not re-enter a door, leaving the player free to explore the world pretty much at their leisure. Doors can lead to all kinds of places, and some levels will have over ten doors (or much less . . . or more), leading in and out of various areas. You will also find many places that are populated with vines, ladders (leading to higher or lower levels) and vases, some of which can be entered. Making the world of Super Mario Bros. 2 a lot larger with various areas and environments within one level. Which is a big improvement over the original game.Super Mario Bros. 2 has great variety in the design of it's levels. Some worlds are themed to a degree as well. You will come across desert landscapes, ice and snow levels, and more green, tropical style levels (complete with Palm Trees), which generally come with a lot of waterfalls. The first time you see a desert stage though, or even the initial level with it's waterfalls, you will realize how big of an improvement the game is graphically over the original Mario Bros.Stages have their own quirks too that make them different. Desert stages for example will have pyramids that you can enter. Once you're inside you will find that you will need to press the B Button to dig through the soft sand. Digging will have the character pull out that space of dirt right below them . . . . and there is lots of dirt! Generally you will have to dig about 5 or more screens before you reach the bottom, encountering enemies and cherries along the way. This mechanic still feels really cool and I can't even think of another game that's similar in the digging department.You will also encounter locked doors in Super Mario Bros. 2, and they will require a key that you will have to pick up and carry from one location (generally far away) to the location of the door that is locked. Picking up a key will summon these faces/masks called Phanto`s, that are on the wall and will chase after you. If you throw the key they will go away until you pick it up again, and they can't be killed.A lot of these locked doors will be found inside these kind of construction/warehouse type environments (though like the first game, much of Super Mario Bros. 2 is only black backgrounds), where you will find chains you can climb, Mushroom Blocks you can pick up, stack and throw, and various hazards ranging from Sparky enemies that will encircle platforms and harm you if you touch them, to spikes or even pits where you will die or be damaged if you fall.The non-linear nature of Super Mario Bros. 2 really comes into play throughout the game. You will come to find that lots of levels actually have multiple paths you can take. Or at least two paths. And many of them feature secrets that will lead to "backdoors", these doors will take you directly to the boss of the level, or to our pal Birdo.Birdo is a strange dinosaur-like creature who spits eggs out at you and serves as a boss, mini-boss and all around common enemy throughout the game. You will fight different varieties of Birdo in different environments. The main form of attack Birdo has is spitting out eggs, which you jump on top of and throw back at him (her? In the new games it's a girl) to kill it. You will also encounter Birdo's that spit fire. At the end of nearly every stage will be a Birdo fight. So learn to enjoy them!The end of the level, generally after a Birdo fight will lead you to a pearl that when picked up will open this "Bird Door" that will lead to the next level. The Bird Door only helps to give the game it's dreamy, otherwordly kind of feel.While Super Mario Bros. 2 is easily one of the best games from my childhood and thus it has a lot of nostalgic value, playing through it again has made me realize how many memorable moments the game has. And that I believe is it's biggest difference from the first Super Mario Bros. game. The stages are SOO unique. And there really are too many cool moments to name.One level for example has a giant waterfall. You start about half-way, and there are clouds leading upward, which is the direction to go if you want to proceed through the level. If, however, you jump down, you will fall and in the middle at the bottom of the waterfall is a little island (if you miss the island you fall to your doom). There is a door on the lil' isle, go inside and you will find a room packed full of veggies. And somewhere in there is a potion, if you can find it all those veggies (or as much as you can pull, if you haven't pulled them up before entering Sub-Con) will of course be coins. And you get the Mushroom as well.Another level has a huge uncrossable gap. The only way to cross it is to use Birdo! He'll shoot an egg and you can actually jump on top of that egg and it will sail you across to the other side. Don't forget to take the potion with you! Another waterfall level has you crossing the waterfalls by jumping on top of fish which will jump up from below. But you have to be careful because if you fall you'll die. Still another level has you sailing on top of a bird! With no ground beneath! Another stage features whales. These whales will shoot water out of their blow holes which you can stand on to get to the higher platforms.And that is just the tip of the iceberg! The levels in Super Mario Bros. 2 easily and single-handedly eclipse anything in the original Super Mario Bros. From the digging to the ice worlds to the secrets to the backdoors and multiple paths to the various environments to the warp pipes to the bosses, Super Mario Bros. 2 is one diverse game.And you really get better the more you play too. As in the example above of the room with a ton of vegetables demonstrates (you will encounter a lot of similar rooms), the player will benefit from actually knowing the layout of the stages and knowing where Mushrooms, Potions and whatnot are located.And did I mention the bosses? This game has some really cool boss fights. Such as Mouser, a mouse who will hurl bombs at you. You have to catch the bombs and toss or set them up on his platform, timing them right so that they explode and hit him as he gets close to them. Or Fry Guy, a big flame-head that will fly around the room dropping little fires. You have to use the Mushroom Blocks in the room to hit him three times (which is the sweet spot for most bosses) by using the platforms above where he flies, after which he'll burst into four little flames that must be extinguished before he is completely defeated.A cool element of the Fry Guy fight is the fact that, while the fight takes place on one-screen, you can keep going through the edge of the screen at which point you'll pop-out on the other side. In fact, if you go half-way, then half of you will be on one-side and the other half will be on the other side! You can even hurl a Mushroom Block at the edge of the screen and, naturally, watch it sail onto the other side, hopefully hitting Fry Guy in the process.This kind of effect is really neat and a far cry from anything you see in the first Super Mario Bros. And there are other levels where this effect will come into play as well. One stage in particular has you hopping on platforms to reach the top of the screen, where-in it will scroll up one, until you reach the top of the environment. But while on a single screen and hopping on the platforms leading up, there are platforms on the edges which you can stand on and if you keep going to the edge of the screen you'll pop-up on the platform on the opposite side. So while you are going up you'll encounter plants that will be coming down . .. this plant will shoot fire that will fall both on the left and right of the plant. The only way to avoid it is to run across the platforms at the edge to pop out on the other side of the screen if the fire is coming your way. It's hard to describe but in the actual game it happens seemlessly and is a cool gameplay effect.And it's this type of unique gameplay that makes the game really imaginative and fun. You really haven't seen anything like it, and even today it is unique among 2D 8-bit platformers. It's also interesting that you actually seem to do a lot more platforming and jumping in Super Mario Bros. 2 than you do in the original, which is ironic considering how the original is all about jumping. The world in Super Mario Bors. 2 is HUGE too compared to the original Super Mario Bros., and the game, if played straight through, is much longer, at least twice if not three times as long.Super Mario Bros. 2 also contains an incredible amount of secrets. You will find many pathways which will lead off the beaten path. Generally they will either take you to an area full of coins, or they will lead to a backdoor that will quickly take you past the level and directly to the boss. The first time you find one of these and you find yourself entering the boss stage by jumping down from the dirt roof at the top it will hit you that this is one unique game (the roof area is just a straight wall leading to the top of the screen and naturally there is no way to get up there from the other side).And secrets like the one mentioned above litter the levels. And many of these are really memorable moments that will probably stick with you after you have completed the game. And for those that have played Super Mario Bros. 2 before it will be really gratifying encountering these nostalgic scenes again. I know for me it brought many fond memories flooding back into my brain.I mean who doesn't remember throwing Mushroom Blocks on top of clouds so that you could stand on them and cross the gap? (even though Princess can simply float across). Or letting the quicksand in one level take you UNDER the starting wall . . . which leads to a backdoor to the boss? If you haven't encountered these secerts then you really owe it to yourself to experience it.The game even contains some well hidden warp pipes (er . . . warp vases?), which will transport you to another world. The warp pipes are cool to find as they can only be found/discovered in Sub-Con, and you will only know it's a warp pipe by entering it. Can you find them all?The game is also surprisingly difficult. Yet it's rarely frustrating, which is a nice balance. It can be easy to die and you will die quite a bit, but you will always feel that it was your own mistake that killed you, not anything cheap. And due to the slot machine in between levels and how many coins you find, you will generally have lots of extra lives, so getting "Game Over" is pretty hard to do unless you are super reckless.Graphic-wise, the game is really colorful in comparison to Super Mario Bros. 1, which has a really dull color pallet, although the NES version of Super Mario Bros. 2 isn't nearly as colorful as the All-Stars version, which also has characters that are much, much improved. And obviously the environments are a lot more diverse, with desert landscapes, ice, waterfalls, frozen places, and more. It really gives the game a lot of variety and you will never get bored with the levels.All the tunes in the game are good and if you played the game back in the day then they will definitely bring back some extremely nostalgic memories and feelings. The music is nice, happy and upbeat, except for the inside/warehouse type tune, which is perfectly fitting. While the music is pretty great overall, there really are only a few tunes which play throughout the whole game which can get old.Super Mario Bros. 2 actually has quite a lot of replay value. I played the game start to finish three times for this review. The first time I used warp pipes (skipping some worlds entirely), the second time I followed secrets and back doors (skipping large parts of some levels) and the third time I played straight through without using any secrets or back doors. So the game contains a lot of replay value for a game of it's age.All in all, Super Mario Bros. 2 is a phenomenal platformer by anyone's standards. It holds up to the test of time extremely well and is no less fun nowadays. And if you've never played the game before then you surely are in for a great time. There are tons of secrets to discover and it's very likely that you will play the game several times if you want to see the entire game. The gameplay is so unique that I can't even think of a modern game (or classic one for that matter), that comes close to mimicking what is on display in Super Mario Bros. 2. And even if it did, Super Mario Bros. 2 definitely does it best. The gameplay is so refined that it's practically perfect. Any complaints I have are so minimal they aren't even worth mentioning.Super Mario Bros. 2 is a definite classic that all gamers should have in their library.Should I buy Super Mario Bros. 2 for the Wii?As the most unique and different Mario game in the series, there is no reason why you shouldn't purchase this $5 NES title on the Wii. Whether you have played it before or not, it's probably still worth purchasing due to the sheer amount of replay value it has for an 8-bit pre Super Mario Bros. 3 title.Even if you have played it extensively, it's still a fun game and there is surely some parts of the game you haven't seen. So why not add it to your collection? And the Wii will make it much easier to get the game for those that don't want to play it on a portable system and don't feel like tracking it down for one of their older consoles (SNES and NES) and having to deal with cartridge problems.FUN FACTOR: 8.0With it's pick-up-and-throw gameplay, bevy of secrets and really unique worlds, the gameplay stays fun throughout the 7 worlds of the game, with lots to see; requiring a few play-throughs before you will see it all.Graphics: 8.5The game looks great . . . for an NES title. While it is very colorful compared to Super Mario Bros., it still looks dull today, especially the characters, and especially in comparison to the SNES All-Stars version. The unique environments make up for the graphical detail though.Ingenuity: 9.0This is by far, with the exception of perhaps Yoshi's Island, the most unique game in the 2D Super Mario Bros. series. No other game involves picking up and throwing things in the way Mario 2 does, and while it's not mind-blowing nowdays, it was for the time. And even now it still feels highly original and the gameplay is refined to near perfection. The idea of Sub-Con is also really neat and was highly original for the time as well.Replay Value: 8.5Due to multiple paths, lots of secrets, hidden warp pipes and back doors, Super Mario Bros. 2 is not a game where you can see everything your first play-through. It will take a few play-throughs to see all that it has to offer, and the game stays pretty fun throughout even though you are simply hurtling things beginning to end. Most people who want to see all the games has to offer will want to play more than once, which is pretty good for this type of game since there are no difficulties, no extra modes and no 2-player.
Shigeru Miyamoto created a masterpiece when he createdthe Mario Bros. series and this game is no exception.I first played Mario Bros. 2 during the late 1980's orearly 1990's and it was much better then Mario Bros.,it had better graphics, sound, gameplay and the enemiesand bosses as well as levels were much more interestingand trippy this time around.You could also play as either Mario, Luigi, Peach or Toad.I give this game 5/5 stars and thanks goes to my Mom for buyingthis game for me as well as my NES in the first place!;)Here is an excellent and detailed review which best sums upthis great game which I have edited and left SMB All Stars out.From:[...]There is only one way to describe Super Mario Bros. 2 . . . . And that word is: Odd.As the second game in the series, Mario Bros. 2 does exactly everything that you WOULDN'T expect from a sequel to the first game. It takes the characters in the Mario universe, adds them to a strange and quirky world, and then takes the gameplay of the first game and absolutely tips it on it's head.There are several design changes that factor in to making Super Mario Bros. 2 so different from the first game in the way it plays. First off is the elimination of the timer. Since there is no timer on any of the levels, you are no longer racing to try and finish the game as fast as you can. The second difference is the fact that you can go backwards in a level. In the original game, when the level scrolled, you could no longer go back in that direction (which made sense in Mario 1 because you are always racing to reach the end of the level before the timer runs out and you die, so there is no reason to go back).Thirdly . . . while Super Mario Bros. 1 popularized the aspect of a side-scrolling game, meaning that the screen scrolls to reveal a bigger playfield (instead of being confined to a single-screen as in games like Pac-Man or Galaga) it was still a game that was confined in the sense that you could only go forwards, you were forced to go forwards (even though you scrolled the screen yourself). Super Mario Bros. 2 changed all that by letting the scrolling of the level, either forwards or backwards, be completely up to the player.However the biggest change did not come from the aforementioned improvements, but rather from another improvement . . . one that you didn't really see much of in the first Super Mario Bros. This sequel let the player explore the world in a whole new way . . . a new dimension. And that dimension was vertically. Mario 2 opens up the whole notion of vertical gameplay to the player. Whether it's jumping onto platform after platform that are suspended in the air, or climbing vines or ladders, Super Mario Bros. 2 sends the player vertically just as often as you scroll left or right, which is a dramatic change.The combination of the lack of a timer, the ability to go backwards and the insistence of the levels in pushing you upwards, gives Super Mario Bros. 2 a COMPLETELY different feel as far as level design goes. And that vertical aspect comes into play as soon as you start the game and are immediately dropped from a door in the sky to the ground below you.Believe it or not, these are not the only changes that separate Super Mario Bros. 2 from it's prequel.But I'm getting ahead of myself here. First a look at some history. Although many do not know it, one reason that Super Mario Bros. 2 is so different from all the other games in the series is because it originally was not a Mario game at all! What we know in America as Super Mario Bros. 2 was actually a game that was only released in Japan. This game was developed by Nintendo and called Doki Doki Panic. Actually the full title is Yume Kj: Doki Doki Panikku which translates to Dream Factory: Doki Doki Panic.This quirky NES game was Mario-ized and brought to America and other regions as Super Mario Bros. 2. The Mario version was also later released in Japan as Super Mario USA.The real sequel to Super Mario Bros. was actually a game that was strikingly similar to the first game. Matter of fact it was really just a remixed version. It was much more difficult than the original and allowed you to play single-player as either Mario or Luigi, with both characters having different abilities (Luigi jumped higher but was harder to stop once he took off running). It also added the new Poisonous Mushroom (identified by their purple color) to the equation. If you grabbed a Poisonous Mushroom it'd harm you rather than help you.Nintendo of Japan however had a hard time deciding whether or not to release Super Mario Bros. 2 (Jap) in the US, fearing that it would be too difficult for American players (it was common in the Japanese video game world at that time to underestimate the abilities of American and European players, even though we had no problem with supremely tough games like Metroid or Contra).So they decided to take another game that they thought was easier (which is quite ironic, cause it's definitely not an easy game) and modify the game, making it into a Mario title to release in the US as Super Mario Bros. 2. The game was developed in cooperation with Fuji Television (who licensed the characters for Nintendo to use) to promote their Yume Kj '87 event in Japan, which showcased several of Fuji TV's latest TV shows and other products at the time. Doki Doki Panic featured the mascots of the Yume Kj festival (an Arabian family consisting of siblings Imajin and Lina and their parents, Papa and Mama) as its main characters and the rest of the characters, including the main villain, Mamu (Renamed Wart for the modified American version), were all original creations by Nintendo for the game.Doki Doki Panic takes place within a book with this Arabian or Indian setting (which explains the desert landscapes and Arabian-style sounding music) where all four characters are sucked into it's world. They are all playable as well, and the game is not completed until the player plays through the game as all four of them, unlike in the American remake.For the modified US version of Doki Doki Panic, Mario corresponds to the Imajin character, Princess Toadstool (or Peach as she's known now) corresponds to Lina, Luigi corresponds to Mama and the stout Papa corresponds to Toad.So Nintendo did all this modifying (leaving most of the game exactly the same, including the enemies and bosses and most of the music and sound effects) thinking that no American player would know the difference. And they were right. Unless you worked in the video game industry or for gaming publications and were in the know, then you'd never realize that what you were playing was not a "true" Mario game.Super Mario Bros. 2 (US) was widely accepted by the people that played it despite it's oddball flavor, and it become so popular and infamous for it's uniqueness that it actually became considered by Nintendo as the real Super Mario Bros. 2 and took it's place alongside the other core games in the Mario saga (Super Mario Bros. 1, 2, and 3, Super Mario World, Super Mario 64, etc.).And the elements of Super Mario Bros. 2 (US) that weren't originally Mario but Doki, such as the enemies like Bob-Ombs, Birdo and Shy Guy`s (who were unchanged from their Doki Doki Panic origins), actually became part of the Mario universe.Nowadays Birdo has developed more into a full-fledged Mario mascot character and taken his place alongside Yoshi; as is evidenced by her appearance as a Yoshi team-up character in Mario Kart: Double Dash on GameCube and in some Mario sports titles.Had Nintendo never converted Doki Doki Panic into a Mario game and released it as such in the US, then many of the beloved characters that people now love would never have existed. And that would definitely be a shame.So I for one am glad that we got this Nintendo game instead of the "real" Super Mario Bros. 2 [Jap] since it is much more unique and original than what we would have gotten, and the new enemies that came along for the ride ended up being great additions to the Mario family (The Japanese Super Mario Bros. 2 btw would later hit America for the Super Nintendo as part of the Super Mario All-Stars compilation, in which it was included as Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels)So . . . now getting back to the differences in gameplay between Super Mario Bros. 1 and this Super Mario Bros. 2 (US). Whereas the main form of attack in the original game is jumping on the heads of the various enemies, this game changed all that by allowing every enemy in the game (virtually) to be picked up and thrown. Matter of fact, there are no enemies in the game that can be destroyed by jumping on their heads! Your form of attack is now exclusively picking up and throwing. And it's not just enemies that you can pick up and throw at other enemies, but lots of other things as well. For example, the game is also littered with . . . . VEGETABLES! Veggies can be pulled out of the ground and hurled to kill enemies (All enemies in the game die with one hit outside of bosses) and you will find that they play a prominent role throughout the game. They appear in both small and large varieties.Super Mario Bros. 2 was also the first Mario game to introduce other playable characters, which was a huge change from the first game. In Super Mario Bros. 2 you can play as not only Mario and Luigi, but also the Princess and Toad. While both of the latter characters did appear in the first Super Mario Bros., it was really Super Mario Bros. 2 that popularized them and made legions of fans of those characters since it was our first shot at actually being able to play as them. And even though they were simply character swaps for the Doki characters, most people, like me, didn't know that as kids and took a personal liking to the Toad and Princess characters. I have always loved Toad ever since I played Super Mario Bros. 2 when I was about 5 years old. I thought the little guy was great (and I'm still holding out hope that he'll get his own spot as a playable character in Super Smash Bros. Brawl).Each character has their own abilities that make them useful in different situations. The speed at which they run or the height of their jump when holding an item, the speed at which they lift items, and the height of their jump all differs between characters.Mario (typical nowadays) is the "average" character, he doesn't really excel at any one ability. Luigi is the character with the highest jump, he's also the tallest character. Toad is the shortest of the bunch and also the quickest at running and lifting, but he also has the lowest jump. Princess on the other hand is the slowest lifter, but she has an ability that's completely unique to her character (and one she inherited for her debut in Super Smash Bros. Melee) . . . if you hold the jump button, she can FLOAT for a short time! This almost makes her a kind of unfair character as she really is a great choice no matter what level you are on cause you can almost always benefit from her floating ability.As for the other features of Mario, such as coins and items, everything in Super Mario Bros. 2 has been changed up or altered from the first game. Although the way you progress from level to level is still largely the same, as there are a number of worlds and each world has 3 levels, and it uses the same dash system, so world 2-2 would mean the second level on the second world. Pipes though, a major feature of the first Super Mario Bros. have been replaced with these objects that look like vases, some of which can be entered by pressing down, leading inside the vase, much like a pipe in the first game.You now have a life bar made up of hearts on the left side of the screen. If you lose all your hearts by getting hit, then the containers will empty and you will die. If you only have one heart then you are small. You start with two containers, and can get up to four in any one level (containers do not carry on to the next level).If you are small, then getting another heart or a Mushroom will make you grow. Mushrooms are the only way you can get another heart container, and you only find Mushrooms in what is known as "sub-con", which is basically another dimension of the world. Throughout the levels are a certain number of these red potions. You will pull them up from the ground like a vegetable. If you throw the potion, it will create a door. Enter that door and whatever is on the screen will turn dark to signify that you are in another dimension, in "sub-con".Sub-con is a big part of the game. Mushrooms, as well as coins, only appear in sub-con. But Mushrooms only appear in a specific spot. So to get that Mushroom, you are required to throw the door at the place where you think a Mushroom may be. While it's true that Mushrooms theoretically can appear anywhere in a level, they will generally appear in some obvious places, usually where you find many vegetables or something else to give you a hint. Vegetables in Sub-Con turn into coins (one veggie counts as one coin). Coins count towards how many tries you will have at the slot machine in between stages, where you can earn extra lives (and it is the only way to earn extra lives outside of some uncommon 1-Up Mushrooms that you will occasionally pull from the ground).The last big piece of the Super Mario Bros. 2 world are cherries. Cherries kind of take the place of coins in the previous Super Mario Bros., that is, while outside Sub-Con you will see cherries just floating in the air, as coins did in the previous game (actually, they aren't so much floating as nailed, literally, to the air). Grabbing enough cherries will summon a Starman, which works just as in Super Mario Bros. and will give you invincibility for a short amount of time.Super Mario Bros. 2 keeps a nice balance in the way the various game mechanics come into play. For example, unlike most games, the only way to heal yourself (outside a Mushroom) is by killing enemies, which will summon a heart to come floating onto the screen from below, collect it to fill a heart container. This helps in giving you a reason to actually kill enemies instead of simply running past them. You will also occasionally come across other items that you will pull from the ground. These include Shells, which you throw and jump on top of as they slide across the ground, killing any enemies in their path, Stop Watches, which you will pull from the ground once you've pulled 5 big vegetables. Stop Watches will freeze time for a short period. You will also occasionally come across "POW" blocks. These big black boxes will shake the screen once thrown and destroy any enemy that's touching the ground. POW's are still a really cool part of the Mario universe, although they haven't shown up as prominently since Super Mario Bros. 2. But they did make a cameo appearence in the first Super Smash Bros. on the Classic Mushroom Kingdom stage and they occasionally will pop-up in different Mario titles.The last real item you'll come across are bombs. Similar to in the Zelda series, you will come across bricks which can be blown up by using bombs. Bombs will explode a bit after you pick them up and you pull them from the ground like you would vegetables. Bombs will always appear near where they need to be used.And speaking of bombs, this segues into the almost puzzle like aspects of Super Mario Bros. 2. There are many points in the game where you will have to bomb walls or bricks in a certain way. For example, there may be a platform above a lower one, with breaks and walls that can be bombed, blocking the middle of the bottom platform. And if you go into sub-con a Mushroom will appear, but you may only be able to get that Mushroom if you have bombed the right spots.Early on you will come to a secret where you need to drop a bomb down a skinny area where a bombable wall is blocking the door. But it's only wide enough for your character and if you fall or climb down you don't have enough room to throw the bomb. So you gotta drop it from above, and the key is to wait for the bomb to flash and time your throw so that it blows up at the right time, destroying at least two blocks, which will give you enough room to fit in through the gap. And these types of little bombing areas are numerous.Unlike the original Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 2 is a lot more non-linear. You can pretty much complete the levels as slow or as quick as you want, for the reasons mentioned above, but also the world itself is also a lot more complex.The world in Super Mario Bros. 2 is full of doors. All the doors can be entered and exited by pressing the Up Button. And there is almost no point where you can not re-enter a door, leaving the player free to explore the world pretty much at their leisure. Doors can lead to all kinds of places, and some levels will have over ten doors (or much less . . . or more), leading in and out of various areas. You will also find many places that are populated with vines, ladders (leading to higher or lower levels) and vases, some of which can be entered. Making the world of Super Mario Bros. 2 a lot larger with various areas and environments within one level. Which is a big improvement over the original game.Super Mario Bros. 2 has great variety in the design of it's levels. Some worlds are themed to a degree as well. You will come across desert landscapes, ice and snow levels, and more green, tropical style levels (complete with Palm Trees), which generally come with a lot of waterfalls. The first time you see a desert stage though, or even the initial level with it's waterfalls, you will realize how big of an improvement the game is graphically over the original Mario Bros.Stages have their own quirks too that make them different. Desert stages for example will have pyramids that you can enter. Once you're inside you will find that you will need to press the B Button to dig through the soft sand. Digging will have the character pull out that space of dirt right below them . . . . and there is lots of dirt! Generally you will have to dig about 5 or more screens before you reach the bottom, encountering enemies and cherries along the way. This mechanic still feels really cool and I can't even think of another game that's similar in the digging department.You will also encounter locked doors in Super Mario Bros. 2, and they will require a key that you will have to pick up and carry from one location (generally far away) to the location of the door that is locked. Picking up a key will summon these faces/masks called Phanto`s, that are on the wall and will chase after you. If you throw the key they will go away until you pick it up again, and they can't be killed.A lot of these locked doors will be found inside these kind of construction/warehouse type environments (though like the first game, much of Super Mario Bros. 2 is only black backgrounds), where you will find chains you can climb, Mushroom Blocks you can pick up, stack and throw, and various hazards ranging from Sparky enemies that will encircle platforms and harm you if you touch them, to spikes or even pits where you will die or be damaged if you fall.The non-linear nature of Super Mario Bros. 2 really comes into play throughout the game. You will come to find that lots of levels actually have multiple paths you can take. Or at least two paths. And many of them feature secrets that will lead to "backdoors", these doors will take you directly to the boss of the level, or to our pal Birdo.Birdo is a strange dinosaur-like creature who spits eggs out at you and serves as a boss, mini-boss and all around common enemy throughout the game. You will fight different varieties of Birdo in different environments. The main form of attack Birdo has is spitting out eggs, which you jump on top of and throw back at him (her? In the new games it's a girl) to kill it. You will also encounter Birdo's that spit fire. At the end of nearly every stage will be a Birdo fight. So learn to enjoy them!The end of the level, generally after a Birdo fight will lead you to a pearl that when picked up will open this "Bird Door" that will lead to the next level. The Bird Door only helps to give the game it's dreamy, otherwordly kind of feel.While Super Mario Bros. 2 is easily one of the best games from my childhood and thus it has a lot of nostalgic value, playing through it again has made me realize how many memorable moments the game has. And that I believe is it's biggest difference from the first Super Mario Bros. game. The stages are SOO unique. And there really are too many cool moments to name.One level for example has a giant waterfall. You start about half-way, and there are clouds leading upward, which is the direction to go if you want to proceed through the level. If, however, you jump down, you will fall and in the middle at the bottom of the waterfall is a little island (if you miss the island you fall to your doom). There is a door on the lil' isle, go inside and you will find a room packed full of veggies. And somewhere in there is a potion, if you can find it all those veggies (or as much as you can pull, if you haven't pulled them up before entering Sub-Con) will of course be coins. And you get the Mushroom as well.Another level has a huge uncrossable gap. The only way to cross it is to use Birdo! He'll shoot an egg and you can actually jump on top of that egg and it will sail you across to the other side. Don't forget to take the potion with you! Another waterfall level has you crossing the waterfalls by jumping on top of fish which will jump up from below. But you have to be careful because if you fall you'll die. Still another level has you sailing on top of a bird! With no ground beneath! Another stage features whales. These whales will shoot water out of their blow holes which you can stand on to get to the higher platforms.And that is just the tip of the iceberg! The levels in Super Mario Bros. 2 easily and single-handedly eclipse anything in the original Super Mario Bros. From the digging to the ice worlds to the secrets to the backdoors and multiple paths to the various environments to the warp pipes to the bosses, Super Mario Bros. 2 is one diverse game.And you really get better the more you play too. As in the example above of the room with a ton of vegetables demonstrates (you will encounter a lot of similar rooms), the player will benefit from actually knowing the layout of the stages and knowing where Mushrooms, Potions and whatnot are located.And did I mention the bosses? This game has some really cool boss fights. Such as Mouser, a mouse who will hurl bombs at you. You have to catch the bombs and toss or set them up on his platform, timing them right so that they explode and hit him as he gets close to them. Or Fry Guy, a big flame-head that will fly around the room dropping little fires. You have to use the Mushroom Blocks in the room to hit him three times (which is the sweet spot for most bosses) by using the platforms above where he flies, after which he'll burst into four little flames that must be extinguished before he is completely defeated.A cool element of the Fry Guy fight is the fact that, while the fight takes place on one-screen, you can keep going through the edge of the screen at which point you'll pop-out on the other side. In fact, if you go half-way, then half of you will be on one-side and the other half will be on the other side! You can even hurl a Mushroom Block at the edge of the screen and, naturally, watch it sail onto the other side, hopefully hitting Fry Guy in the process.This kind of effect is really neat and a far cry from anything you see in the first Super Mario Bros. And there are other levels where this effect will come into play as well. One stage in particular has you hopping on platforms to reach the top of the screen, where-in it will scroll up one, until you reach the top of the environment. But while on a single screen and hopping on the platforms leading up, there are platforms on the edges which you can stand on and if you keep going to the edge of the screen you'll pop-up on the platform on the opposite side. So while you are going up you'll encounter plants that will be coming down . .. this plant will shoot fire that will fall both on the left and right of the plant. The only way to avoid it is to run across the platforms at the edge to pop out on the other side of the screen if the fire is coming your way. It's hard to describe but in the actual game it happens seemlessly and is a cool gameplay effect.And it's this type of unique gameplay that makes the game really imaginative and fun. You really haven't seen anything like it, and even today it is unique among 2D 8-bit platformers. It's also interesting that you actually seem to do a lot more platforming and jumping in Super Mario Bros. 2 than you do in the original, which is ironic considering how the original is all about jumping. The world in Super Mario Bors. 2 is HUGE too compared to the original Super Mario Bros., and the game, if played straight through, is much longer, at least twice if not three times as long.Super Mario Bros. 2 also contains an incredible amount of secrets. You will find many pathways which will lead off the beaten path. Generally they will either take you to an area full of coins, or they will lead to a backdoor that will quickly take you past the level and directly to the boss. The first time you find one of these and you find yourself entering the boss stage by jumping down from the dirt roof at the top it will hit you that this is one unique game (the roof area is just a straight wall leading to the top of the screen and naturally there is no way to get up there from the other side).And secrets like the one mentioned above litter the levels. And many of these are really memorable moments that will probably stick with you after you have completed the game. And for those that have played Super Mario Bros. 2 before it will be really gratifying encountering these nostalgic scenes again. I know for me it brought many fond memories flooding back into my brain.I mean who doesn't remember throwing Mushroom Blocks on top of clouds so that you could stand on them and cross the gap? (even though Princess can simply float across). Or letting the quicksand in one level take you UNDER the starting wall . . . which leads to a backdoor to the boss? If you haven't encountered these secerts then you really owe it to yourself to experience it.The game even contains some well hidden warp pipes (er . . . warp vases?), which will transport you to another world. The warp pipes are cool to find as they can only be found/discovered in Sub-Con, and you will only know it's a warp pipe by entering it. Can you find them all?The game is also surprisingly difficult. Yet it's rarely frustrating, which is a nice balance. It can be easy to die and you will die quite a bit, but you will always feel that it was your own mistake that killed you, not anything cheap. And due to the slot machine in between levels and how many coins you find, you will generally have lots of extra lives, so getting "Game Over" is pretty hard to do unless you are super reckless.Graphic-wise, the game is really colorful in comparison to Super Mario Bros. 1, which has a really dull color pallet, although the NES version of Super Mario Bros. 2 isn't nearly as colorful as the All-Stars version, which also has characters that are much, much improved. And obviously the environments are a lot more diverse, with desert landscapes, ice, waterfalls, frozen places, and more. It really gives the game a lot of variety and you will never get bored with the levels.All the tunes in the game are good and if you played the game back in the day then they will definitely bring back some extremely nostalgic memories and feelings. The music is nice, happy and upbeat, except for the inside/warehouse type tune, which is perfectly fitting. While the music is pretty great overall, there really are only a few tunes which play throughout the whole game which can get old.Super Mario Bros. 2 actually has quite a lot of replay value. I played the game start to finish three times for this review. The first time I used warp pipes (skipping some worlds entirely), the second time I followed secrets and back doors (skipping large parts of some levels) and the third time I played straight through without using any secrets or back doors. So the game contains a lot of replay value for a game of it's age.All in all, Super Mario Bros. 2 is a phenomenal platformer by anyone's standards. It holds up to the test of time extremely well and is no less fun nowadays. And if you've never played the game before then you surely are in for a great time. There are tons of secrets to discover and it's very likely that you will play the game several times if you want to see the entire game. The gameplay is so unique that I can't even think of a modern game (or classic one for that matter), that comes close to mimicking what is on display in Super Mario Bros. 2. And even if it did, Super Mario Bros. 2 definitely does it best. The gameplay is so refined that it's practically perfect. Any complaints I have are so minimal they aren't even worth mentioning.Super Mario Bros. 2 is a definite classic that all gamers should have in their library.Should I buy Super Mario Bros. 2 for the Wii?As the most unique and different Mario game in the series, there is no reason why you shouldn't purchase this $5 NES title on the Wii. Whether you have played it before or not, it's probably still worth purchasing due to the sheer amount of replay value it has for an 8-bit pre Super Mario Bros. 3 title.Even if you have played it extensively, it's still a fun game and there is surely some parts of the game you haven't seen. So why not add it to your collection? And the Wii will make it much easier to get the game for those that don't want to play it on a portable system and don't feel like tracking it down for one of their older consoles (SNES and NES) and having to deal with cartridge problems.FUN FACTOR: 8.0With it's pick-up-and-throw gameplay, bevy of secrets and really unique worlds, the gameplay stays fun throughout the 7 worlds of the game, with lots to see; requiring a few play-throughs before you will see it all.Graphics: 8.5The game looks great . . . for an NES title. While it is very colorful compared to Super Mario Bros., it still looks dull today, especially the characters, and especially in comparison to the SNES All-Stars version. The unique environments make up for the graphical detail though.Ingenuity: 9.0This is by far, with the exception of perhaps Yoshi's Island, the most unique game in the 2D Super Mario Bros. series. No other game involves picking up and throwing things in the way Mario 2 does, and while it's not mind-blowing nowdays, it was for the time. And even now it still feels highly original and the gameplay is refined to near perfection. The idea of Sub-Con is also really neat and was highly original for the time as well.Replay Value: 8.5Due to multiple paths, lots of secrets, hidden warp pipes and back doors, Super Mario Bros. 2 is not a game where you can see everything your first play-through. It will take a few play-throughs to see all that it has to offer, and the game stays pretty fun throughout even though you are simply hurtling things beginning to end. Most people who want to see all the games has to offer will want to play more than once, which is pretty good for this type of game since there are no difficulties, no extra modes and no 2-player.
The Legendary Starfy is the fifth game in the long running Densetsu no Stafy (Legendary Starfy) series; however it is the first Starfy game to be released outside of Japan. The game features a brand new style of platforming called &#34;marine platforming&#34; by the developers, and has that Kirbyish charm, but how does it stand compared to the other platforming games on the DS? Well, lets find out!The Story of Starfy:Although The Legendary Starfy is the fifth game in the series, it really doesn't matter. Just like with the past games, The Legendary Starfy features it's own stand alone story, so it is very easy for anyone to just pick up and completely understand what is going on. While throughout the game characters will mention that they've been on adventures before, none of them really effect the events that unfold here.One day the lazy prince Starfy was sleeping in his bed in the floating castle of Pufftop Palace, when all of a sudden a strange rabbit wearing a space suit crashed through the castle and landed on top of him. At first Starfy wasn't quite sure what to do, but when a few strange characters show up to capture the poor creature, Starfy decides to help; however the rabbit had other plans. After using his special spin attack to save him, Starfy finds that the rabbit fell into the ocean below, and the bad guys were still after him. So, being the kind prince he is, Starfy, along with his best friend Moe the clam, decide to jump into the ocean and follow him. Soon after, Starfy and Moe once again find themselves on a grand adventure.Tose and the Starfy Charm:Two things that really make the Starfy series stand out are, the developers who developed the game, and what I like to call the &#34;Starfy Charm.&#34; The Starfy series is an original series created by the almost completely unknown company Tose, but it isn't the only game they have worked on. The thing about Tose is, they are a ghost company who almost always is behind the scenes of just about EVERY game! Yep, that's right, Tose has developed and co-developed thousands of titles, and chances are that includes almost every game you have ever played. They never put their names on the games they work on, and their staff NEVER shows up in the game's credits, they stay completely unknown. From Final Fantasy, to Kid Icarus and even games like Metal Gear Solid on the Game Boy, Tose has a long line of games under their belt, with plenty of game experience. Even so, due to them holding the copyright along side Nintendo, the Starfy series is the only one they call their own.Besides the fact that it's developer is a ghost company, the game itself has quite a lot of charm, and that's what really makes this game stand out. The entire game uses some really nice bright colors, the music is really catchy and sounds like something you would hear in a Kirby game, all of the enemies are cute animals and sea creatures, and Starfy himself just really makes this game pop. His bright yellow colors really stand out, when he runs his feet spin around like Sonic the Hedgehog and he waves his arms and grows big eyes like he's scared of falling down, he can get dizzy if he spins too much, he smiles and flaps his arms as he glides through the air, and he makes cute little &#34;WHEEEEE&#34; sounds from time to time. Starfy is just a really stand out character, and he makes the entire game enjoyable!Besides how the game looks, there are a few other little touches Tose threw in which really help give the game character as well. Whenever you open and close your DS, you'll hear Starfy make his &#34;WHEEE&#34; sounds, and whenever character's are talking on the touch screen, they'll open and close their mouth and turn around in sync. Although neither of these features are anything major, it is pretty nice to see a game that uses the close/open feature for something other than single use story events, and it is also really nice to see the characters actually move as the talk instead of just having still images. Really, they're both just something you'll have to hear and see for yourself.The Gameplay of Marine Platforming:As I said before, the Starfy series uses a brand new style of platforming gameplay which Tose calls &#34;Marine Platforming.&#34; Since most of the Starfy series takes place underwater, Tose has created a game where the sea creatures can make full use of that water, and do things other games just tend to avoid.While underwater, Starfy can do quite a few different moves, and each one of them actually has different uses. While at the very start of the game his moves are limited, as you go through the adventure more and more become unlocked. Even so, his basic moves always stay the same. First of all, Starfy can move in any direction while he's swimming underwater, and he can also go faster by holding down the B button. By hitting the Y button Starfy can do his famous spin move to attack enemies, but as it gets upgraded it can be used for other things as well.Underwater is a dangerous place, and it is filled with many different enemies, water currents, and obstacles to get in Starfy's way. While some water currents can be pushed through by using his spin moves, others are simply too strong and will require other solutions to get around. From finding hidden paths in walls, to pushing rocks over jet streams, this is what makes up the core gameplay of the underwater sections of Starfy. While the gameplay is actually pretty basic, with enemies not putting up much of a fight, there are actually many secrets to be found in these stages, and you must explore every nook and cranny if you want to get through them. While the first few levels of the game are in fact basic underwater sections, a little bit later on things really start to get creative. Once Starfy starts leaving the water for the land above, things change, and the game truly becomes a unique platformer.While Starfy is on land, his gameplay completely changes, and the game becomes a lot more like a standard platforming game. Stafy can do a weaker version of his spin attack, he can run faster by holding down the attack button, he can jump (and later double jump), and glide, and he can make full use of any traces of water still left around him. For example in some levels water drops will actually be falling from the sky, and Starfy will be able to jump into them, swim through them, and then launch himself into the air to hit the next water drop, or he can use them as platforms to make it to the next area. Soon the game transforms from simply swimming through tunnels, to bouncing off of enemies heads, soaring through the sky, swimming through water suspended in mid air, and using every trick you can think of just to reach that next area. Still, this is only half of the gameplay in The Legendary Starfy.After meeting up with the rabbit, Starfy soon finds that he can transform into different creatures which have their own powers. Although these transformations can only be used in specific areas of the game, each one plays differently, and that really helps change up the gameplay. From running down a forest path burning away vines with a dragon, to turning yourself invisible as a ghost to sneak past enemies, these transformations offer a wide verity of gameplay types, but they are pretty limiting in the end; even so, they do end up playing a major part when it comes to the underline goal of the game.The truth is, above all else, Starfy is a treasure hunting game. There are over one hundred pieces of treasure for Starfy to find during his adventure, and MANY hidden stages to unlock as well. Because of this, you will find yourself searching every inch of each level, solving puzzles you would normally just pass by, and playing mini games just to find that next treasure or unlock that next hidden level. While the game is divided up into worlds, each world has three extra hidden levels, and in these hidden levels you'll find hidden power ups to increase Starfy's health, as well as make his transformations stronger. To go along with the standard treasure hidden in each of the levels, these additions really give you a reason to explore as much as possible; however it still isn't that simple.A lot of the areas you'll come across will actually be off limits the first time you see them. There will either be a strong current blocking your path, enemies that seem to make a bridge but with no true way to get across, or the platform will just be too high to reach. Whenever you come across these sections, it is very clear that Starfy will need to learn some kind of new ability before he can get across, and that's exactly what you'll have to do. You'll have to move on with the game, unlock Starfy's later abilities, and then return to see what you had left behind. Sometimes it was just treasure, but other times it is an entire level, either way you will have to back track if you want to see everything this game has to offer. The good news is, that throughout the game you will also unlock different touch screen features as well. Although most of these are simply there to give you information on how much you've played, and how far you've progressed through the game, others (such as Moe's) will actually help you find the secrets, so you don't always enter a level blind.Mini games and mini side events also play a part in Starfy, but only the latter really matter. Although you will unlock a few mini games to play, they really aren't anything special, and I personally didn't play them more than a few times. While one is a simple fishing game, another is just rubbing the touch screen as fast as possible, and there's also one where you just tap coins on the screen to shoot them. While they may be fun to play from time to time with friends, there really isn't much to offer you if you're going it solo; however the side events are important!As I said before, you can unlock extra levels in each world, but to do so you have to find a door, AND you have to play a mini event. Normally in these mini events one of the sea creatures will ask you for help, and all you have to do is, well, help them. While some events require you to race to the end, others might require you to figure out a little puzzle. Either way these events must be played if you want to unlock the other levels, and they are a very important part of the game. Just a word of advice, you might want to play the game using headphones if you've got them; a few events actually use 3D sound to help track things down, and the DS speakers just don't do it justice.The Multiplayer:The final, main, feature in Starfy is it's multiplayer mode. At the start of some of the levels you can actually talk to Moe and call in Starfy's little sister to help him out. Although she plays a lot like Starfy, she does have access to abilities that Starfy unlocks later in the game, and she even has a few moves Starfy NEVER learns (such as her wall jump). Although this really is a nice addition to the game, there are two down sides to this. First of all, there are some areas of the levels Starfy CANNOT access, so you MUST have a second player if you want to get the rewards, but since this is a DS game it really isn't that simple. If you want to be able to explore every inch of every level, you'll have to own a second DS and either use the single card play, or own another DS and another game card to do the multicard play (which is actually a lot faster). Since buying another DS isn't cheap, chances are this is a feature a lot of people will miss out on.The second major issue with the multiplayer is the fact that it can only be used in a few rooms, normally the first room of each level, and it actually takes quite a bit of time to use. For the sake of this review, I wanted to 100% the game, and explore every inch of every level so I could give a fair review of it; however that required the use of a second DS, and that alone was pretty time consuming. If you only have a single copy of the game, you'll have to talk to Moe, hit download play, turn on your second DS, go to download play and download the Starfy data, and then you have to wait about a minute before you can even play. Sure once you download the game data and start playing everything is fine right? Well, actually, NOPE! The thing is, these two player sections may only last you thirty seconds at most, and once you go through that door at the end, the two player mode ends, and the second player's DS shuts off. Yep, you heard me, it shuts off! Now if you want to play multiplayer again when it allows you to a few rooms later, you'll actually have to do everything all over again. In the end you might actually spend more time waiting for player two to connect than you'll spend time playing.Sure the multiplayer mode is nice, and it can help you out when it comes to fighting bosses, but it is a pretty big pain if you only own one copy of the game, and it really isn't worth messing with unless you're having a hard time fighting a boss; which really shouldn't happen given how easy most of this game is.Pearls and the Shop:One thing I really liked about Starfy is it's whole Pearl system. While most games have coins, rings, or any other object to collect, most of the time it is simply used to collect one hundred of them and to unlock an extra life; however Starfy actually gives an extra use to the whole system! While collecting five pearls will heal Starfy's health some, they also actually go into your pearl count where they can then be spent on little extras. Now these extras really aren't anything major, they are a nice little something to give you a reason to pick the pearls up.The first extra is the whole clothing shop system. Every time you click on &#34;shop&#34; on the main menu, you are given the chance to buy a random piece of clothing which you can put on the 3D model of Starfy (or his sister) which appear on the top screen when the game is paused. Although these pieces of clothing really don't change the game that much, they do allow you to customize your pause screen some, and by completing a clothing set (which only consists of two pieces) you can unlock a special &#34;scene&#34; for the top screen as well. Once again, this really isn't a major feature, but it is a nice little something you can do.The second way these pearls are used is actually in a locked feature which the game doesn't actually allow you to use until you've finished the main game (most likely to avoid spoilers), and that's the toy shop. Basically you can put five pearls into a toy machine, turn the dial, and then open the toy bubble to see what you got. These toys are the enemies and characters you met throughout the game, and they simply provide extra background information on them. Once again, it's not a major feature, but it is kind of nice, and it gives you a reason to keep picking up pearls even after you've got everything from the shop.Post Game:Although Starfy can be beaten in about ten hours, the game actually doesn't end there. Once you finish the game more content opens up, more modes become unlocked, and you can still go back and find any treasure or hidden levels you may have left behind. In the end, although Starfy actually does have a pretty long main game, the game still offers you more reasons to keep on playing, and that's something most games tend to leave out now days. To avoid spoilers I will not say what you all unlock once you finish the game, but I will say it is sure to add on quite a few more hours of gameplay.The Good and the Bad:Starfy is a great game that does a lot of things right, but it also has quite a few problems as well. On the plus side, the game looks really nice, the 2D sprites are nice and colorful, and the 3D backgrounds really help add depth to the game as well. The characters are nice, it has a pretty good (yet simple) story, the mix of underwater and land gameplay was a nice change of pace from what you see in most platformers, the music was great, I really liked the whole pearl system, I liked how the game used 3D sound for some events, and the game was overall REALLY fun! Sure it was simple at times, but a game doesn't always have to be extremely hard to be fun, and this game is a perfect example of that; however there are still some down sides.Although I just said that games don't always have to be hard to be fun, The Legendary Starfy is in fact the easiest game in the Starfy series, and Starfy fans may be a little bit disappointed because of that. The multiplayer mode was also pretty much a pain due to how long it took to connect, and due to the fact that there were areas you could only reach with multiplayer, and the mini games weren't anything special either. Another thing that a lot of people may find annoying is that the touch screen and menus also spoil quite a bit of the game as well, as it lists how many treasures you can find in the world, how many of them pieces of treasure will be notes, how many transformations there are, and it also spoils how many pieces of clothing there are to collect. If you like being kept in the dark about things, I'm sorry to say but Starfy will tell you everything; heck one of the treasures you find at the VERY START of the game spoils that there's a secret boss. That's just something most people tend to enjoy finding out on their own, but this game doesn't allow them to do so. Everything is spelled out for you, and that might be an issue for some.The good news is, the good in Starfy outweighs the bad, and that's what matters. Sure it has it's issues, but it is still a really good game! Personally I'd rate Starfy a 10/10, but that rating just wouldn't be fair. When it comes down to it, The Legendary Starfy deserves a good rating of 8/10. The game is great, but the fact that it is easier may disappoint Starfy fans, and its other few problems really bring it down.Even so, The Legendary Starfy is a star that really shines, and is a must own game if you're a platforming game fan, and you own a DS.
So I'm gunna post my review of the game here... it's big and stuff so I apologize but I didn't wanna start a new thread again.Pokemon X/YWhere to begin... Well I guess at the start. I have been playing Pokemon games since they started. My first game was Pokemon Blue and I have never missed one in the series since. The joy of finding new Pokemon never seems to get old for me. SO when I learned about Pokemon X/Y I was of course Joyful as I usually was when hearing about a new Pokemon game.Nothing could prepare me for this game. Nothing.Gameplay 10/10For those new to Pokemon, You enter a world where we capture, raise, and battle with Animals known as Pokemon. They gain levels, have stats, learn different attacks and each has their own elemental Strengths and Weaknesses attached to them. Fire is weak to water, Water is weak to Grass, Grass is weak to fire etc... there are 18 I believe elements in total and all have their own Rock-Paper-Scissors Pros and Cons. This is back and of course just as fun as ever. Do you want to make a team of all bug Pokemon? Go for it! but know that you will be weak against Flying, Rock and Fire types, and yet strong against Psychic, Poison and Grass etc... Or you could have a team of various Pokemon, ready to fight against all types whenever the need arises. Building your own team has always been a highlight of the series, and with over 700... let me stop right there. SEVEN HUNDRED... different Pokemon to chose from you have a ridiculous number of monsters to chose from to form your 6 slot party. Now not all 700+ are in the game, I believe only around 4-5 hundred are to start, but you can trade Pokemon from previous games up and use them if your friends have it or you can even go back and try the old games etc... But this game has plenty of Pokemon to try out and have fun withFor those that are familiar with Pokemon , this game has everything you would ever want and much MUCH more. First off they have streamlined how leveling your Pokemon works. No longer do you have to Slowly one by one level each of your Pokemon against weak wild Pokemon and then grind more and more and more etc... Instead the game has made a few key changes to how EXP works which I shall list below.1. Any Pokemon that participates in the battle now gets 100% EXP, it no longer gives 50% to one and 50% to another. or 33% to all three etc...2. You get an EXP.Share about 1 hour into the game (After the first gym battle) And this time it is not even a held item! It sits in your inventory and as you fight, any Pokemon that participated in battle gets 100% Exp, any in your party that didn't get 50% exp. This is beyond amazing and is a fantastic way to level your low level Pokemon quickly without having to suffer from putting it in front, and switching out your Pokemon every single fight. If you don't like this feature, you can of course turn it off in the item menu. I suggest not doing so3. Catching a Pokemon still grants you EXP as if you had killed it.As a result of these new EXP changes you spend almost no time simply leveling up Pokemon and instead you will be spending your time trying to catch the Pokemon then you will simply grinding. In fact There are a few Pokemon in each area that aren't quite as common as others. For example in Route 1 there is a Zigzagoon that is harder to find than the more common Pidgey's Fletchings, and Caterpie that wander around. There always seems to be one in each area, and in an attempt to find it you naturally level up your Pokemon (Unless you are running from every battle).Now battles themselves have remained, from a mechanics standpoint, nearly untouched and that's a good thing. There has never been anything wrong with combat in Pokemon and this never needed to be changed. They did of course change the graphics and animations which I will touch on later. There are a lot of smaller, what I like to call Quality of Life Improvements, to the UI and everything that I don't see the need to go into here as if you see them you will know exactly what I mean.EV Training (Effort Values) has become much simpler this time around, you don't have to guess and check what your Pokemon's EV points are. To make along story short, EV points are how the game determines what stat bonuses a Pokemon gains. In all previous games EV points were given only by defeating Pokemon , each Pokemon gives different values. In this game, you can still do that, but you can also use training mini-games on the touch screen to raise it manually. These can get repetitive but it is a fantastic way to make sure your Pokemon get's the points in the stats you want them to be in. I spent an hour filling out my ZigZagoons speed and Attack stats so I knew it would gain the most in those 2 areas as he leveled. If you mess up or don't like how it turned out, you can actually reset EVs now using a specific item. It's been simplified for the best In my opinion as now everyone can take advantage of the EV system and in a much nicer visual way.I wanted to throw this little addition in there, for the first time in pokemon history you more or less get free movement. No longer are you permanently tied to a Grid format. Once you get the Roller Blades (About 1 hour into the game) you are able to move in full 3D movement with the joystick, you can still move in a grid format on the D-pad for precise movement. You are still limited to the grid inside of Pokemon Centers and houses, but so far that's all it's been limited too. I love this, it's a simple change but lord do I love it. Just another Quality of Life mechanic they put in.The Pokemon Aime system looked odd to me at first. It was more or less Nintendogs with Pokemon (sort of). And I kind of ignored it to begin with, But I did give it a try a little bit later and while yes it is still just a way to view and... well pet and feed your Pokemon it's also got hidden bonuses. The first is obvious, the more you pet and play with them the quicker their happiness grows. There are some Pokemon Like Riolu that will only evolve if they are happy enough. The secondary effect is it also grants another form of EXP boost. As you play and feed them their heart meter grows, granting a bonus to EXP gained as you battle, similar to if you had traded them from another trainer. I didn't learn about this until later but now that I know about it, I take time out of my farming to play with my Pokemon a bit, at least the ones I like!The last and certainly not least, new addition is the Mega Evolutions. It's a simple concept really, take an old favorite Pokemon like Mewtwo, Charizard, Blastoise etc... give them a special stone, and press a button on your magical we promise this has nothing what so ever to do with Digimon bracelets, and poof. You get a new Mega Evolution Pokemon! More or less a 4th form for some. Now these are super powerful Pokemon that can really dish out some damage, but only lasts for the one battle, and on top of that you can only have one in your party (or something like that) I am not actually far enough in the game to be able to comment much more on this, but I had to mention that it's there and I am kinda excited to try it out later.All in all, the gameplay is top notch and Fantastic.Music/Sounds 9/10I have always liked Pokemon music, this just seemed to take it to a new level. The only issue I have is that the 3DS/3DSXL's speakers don't give it justice, I hooked the system up to a speaker system in my apartment and then the music came to life, in fact more than I expected. Eery song was fantastic and fit the scene well the battle music is quick and gives an odd sense of urgency, the forest music was somewhat dark and mysterious and the town songs are nice and upbeat. My favorite song thus far is the Gym battle music which... I can't even describe but it's awesome!The sound effects are also as good as ever. Each Pokemon has their own unique Cry (Noise they make) and all Pokemon from previous games have had theirs enhanced to match the quality of the new ones. I noticed this first with Linoone as he is my favorite Pokemon so I noticed his Cry had changed since I've used him in every Pokemon game since he was introduced in Sapphire/Ruby. The battle sound effects also fit the attacks and meld perfectly in with the attack. I can hear that rock throw hitting my Linoone, and it sounds... heavy.My only minor complaint is that they didn't use the Pokemon's voices like the TV show does. The only Pokemon in the game that does is Pikachu, and I really think that they could have just made it that much better had they had all of them sound like they do in the show. It's a minor complaint but there it is!The New PokemonI didn't give this a rating because it's pure opinion, but I haven't found anything wrong with the new Pokemon. They keep coming up with some pretty awesome Ideas of new Pokemon to add... and yes some not so awesome ideas. (I don't' think I will ever forgive them for the Garbage Bag Pokemon from Black/White). I've encountered a Pokemon based on the Robin, A Panda, I've ever seen a Sword Pokemon (Ghost type). Heck my favorite Pokemon is based on a badger. All have their own personalities and it shows during combat and in the Pokemon-Aime thing. It's all a matter of what you like and what you don't like.Graphics 10/10Ok, the biggest update the game has received is to it's graphics. Up to this point, Pokemon games have been nothing but Sprites and sometimes a little movement. All your characters, sprites. All the Pokemon, slightly moving in combat sprites. They didn't have a life of their own, it felt somewhat empty... but no longer.This game, looks, FANTASTIC. One of the best looking games on the 3DS, and it doesn't suffer from poor framerate. I didn't quite realize how much effort they put into the Pokemon's Models until I started battling with them. Every Pokemon past and present has been redone with a 3D model, and I couldn't be happier. Anyone who has played any of the Pokemon stadium games will be familiar with how they look, but now we have them in the Pokemon game! Each Pokemon has their own movements and animations which is even more amazing to me. Take ZigZagoon and Linoone for example. ZigZagoon is known for moving in a ZigZag pattern, so when it attacks it does just that, running left, then right, then left, then attacking. Due to irony, when it evolves it no longer runs in zigzag patterns, it runs in a straight line but is unable to turn easily, so it's attack is no longer a zigzag, it's a straight dash at the opponent, then a jump backwards. This is just one of many examples of each Pokemon's different movements. Attacks also have their own looks and animations, some look better than others but that is to be expected. Now will they look as good as they do when fighting in the show? No, they still for the most part stay in their own battle &#34;Circles&#34; but they just look so much better when fighting I love it, I can't complain at all about it. I really can't praise the game's graphics enough... they took their time with it.Outside of battle, the game still looks amazing, the grass and tall grass still look like they used to and in a tile format, but your character and the other characters all have nice 3D models, even if you don't see them all in combat. You can change your characters clothes, get a little customization there but sadly it's limited to just a few different outfits. I suppose it's better than nothing though!Multiplayer 10/10Lets talk Multi-player. A lot of us as kids got this game and loved to trade and battle with each other, trying to have the better team, etc... But it has always been restricted in many ways. until the DS games came out, internet battling never happened. And even on the DS versions it was still limited and somewhat sluggish. Black/White added the GTS (Global Trade System) why became a great way to obtain hard to find Pokemon, or Pokemon from previous entries in the series you just didn't have the ability to get. But it was still a tad bothersome as you had to go to a specific location, or go to the Pokemon centers to activate these features.NOT ANYMORE!Pokemon X/Y said screw all that moving around, you can battle, Trade, etc... On the go! you wanna trade with a friend? Tap on his avatar on the bottom screen and say &#34;hey I wanna trade&#34; same with battling. If they accept POOF. You trade/battle right then and there. You can even do this for random passer-bys. On the bottom screen will be a constantly updating list of other random players you can challenge to battles or trade with.That not enough for ya? The GTS Is also here, and available world wide. Search for a Pokemon you want to trade for, and it will bring up a list of players that have put that Pokemon up for trade, and what they want in return. You can deposit one of your own, and ask for another Pokemon. For instance say I want a Zangoose, I can deposit a Seviper into the GTS and say &#34;I will trade this for a Zangoose&#34; if someone accepts it the trade occurs and you can pick up the Pokemon later. That's the best part about this, you don't have to sit and wait. It's all done even if your game is turned off. You merely have to check up on it later! you also don't have to Have the Pokemon on you to trade, trading anywhere allows you to access your Storage Bank of Pokemon and trade from there, this is a new feature and one i welcome with wide open arms.This time around they added 2 new features to the Multiplayer!The first is Wonder Trade. This is an... interesting New one. You trade one of your Pokemon , any one ya want, to another random person. You don't know what you are going to get until the trade is completed. And you can do this infinitely. You will probably get a lot of junk Pokemon , but I have already received some things I didn't expect. I got an Eevee, and a wierd other Pokemon I had never seen before. Along with like 3 Caterpies. But still, it's random fun. And each time you use an interaction like Wonder Trade, Trade, Battle... you gain PokeMiles which can be traded for useful items at a vendor in the main city.The other thing they added is O-powers. these are short term buffs you can give yourself or other players. Things like &#34;raise Attack, Raise Defense, Increase Capture Rate, etc...&#34; They last about 3 minutes (at least at level 1) and can be sued as long as you have.. O points I guess they are called. you recover the Points as time passes, using the ability in yourself costs the full point value and using it on a friend or other player costs 1/2 the value. It's just a fun way to help others or yourself out.Final Score:I give Pokemon X/Y, 9 Linoones and a Zigzagoon (9.5) out of 10.It's not perfect, but damn it's close. This is the Pokemon game that I have always wanted ever since the original Pokemon Stadium came out, showing off the Pokemon in 3D. I am a little sad that there isn't a version on the Console, I'm sure they will still make the Stadium U game, but Those only deal with combat, this is the whole game and I adore it. My only complaints I have are really the same complaints I have had from the start of Pokemon's Existence. I hate HMs. Always have, always will.If you are New to the Pokemon series, this is probably the best to start on, even if the start is a bit rough for new players. (They don't explain a heck of a lot it just assumes you know some things by now). But it's also the best in the entire series for experienced and casual returning players alike.
Wii Fit U is the sequel to Wii Fit and Wii Fit Plus, and is playable only on the Wii U. While the game is downloadable on the Nintendo eShop, there may be reasons you want a physical version of the game; perhaps you want to save storage space on your Wii U, to not keep your Wii U constantly connected to the Internet, to be able to bring the game to play at family and friends' houses, or perhaps you just want the green version of the Fit Meter that comes with it. In these cases, you'll be able to purchase this version of the game with a physical disc and a Fit Meter (For those who don't have a balance board yet, you'll want to purchase the bundle with the Balance Board here:Wii Fit U w/Wii Balance Board accessory and Fit Meter - Wii U).The Wii Fit U opening screen starts with same familiar logo and music from Wii fit and Wii Fit Plus. The system will let you copy over any old data from Wii Fit or Wii Fit Plus either through a full System Transfer (a long and rather painful process), or by copying your old data from your Wii onto an SD card. Once I did this I was able to see my old Mii and select it for use.As with Wii Fit, an animated Balance Board will be your host, welcoming you back and explaining the new features of Wii Fit U. First, it explains there are new training modes that have been designed for the Wii U GamePad. Next, it explains that the Wii U GamePad can be used as a personal display, so the TV can be turned off for certain activities, such as the Body Test.The initial Body Test works very much like it did in the original Wii Fit in terms of tracking how your weight and center of balance change over time. One clever new feature is that you have the option of taking photos of your face each time you do the Body Test using the GamePad camera. It'll store the image of your face and you can see how your face changes over time (it'll be displayed in the calendar along with your BMI and Center of Gravity). Photos are saved for three months, but the first photo you take each month is saved for five years so it's a clever way for you to visually keep track of the progression of your weight loss through your face.You then proceed with the Body Test. You'll hold the GamePad in your hands throughout the test, but the weight of the GamePad will be subtracted from your results. As with the old Wii Fit, you test your Center of Balance by standing on the Balance Board as straight as you can. The difference this time is that you're holding the GamePad at eye level, so you have to stand up straight while keeping your face centered on the screen in a frame. As with the original Wii Fit, you'll then see a plot of how balanced you are when you stand. If you're off balance, you'll get advice on how to correct it and the benefits of doing so. They've added some new balance tests that make further use of the Wii U GamePad; in one of them you use the GamePad to "track" a moving ball as it floats in front of you, all while the system is tracking your balance.Next you'll see your BMI (or optionally, your weight). As with the old Wii Fit, you see a colored bar telling you in you're underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese, and your Mii will grow chubbier or thinner depending (sadly, mine got a bit rounder over the last few years).After all this is done, you get your Wii Fit Age, "stamp" your progress into the calendar, and proceed to the main menu.The main menu is called "Wii Fit Plaza". You can select or create new profiles, play the game as a guest, or play multi-player games (unfortunately, since there's only one Balance Board, you have to take turns with these games, there's no way to play them simultaneously nor compete online). Assuming you have a Fit Meter associated with the profile, each time you select the profile you'll be asked to sync it to collect all your offline activity.The Main Menu seems a bit busy at first, but you'll get used to it in time. It's divided into a couple areas:1) A series of windows scrolling across the top of the page will allow you to:- View a monthly calendar of your progress- View graphs of your progress- Register or read more about the Fit Meter- View an album of "snapshots" taken of your Mii during gameplay- View a Notice Board of events that have occured in the game, such as unlocking features, new players being added, and so on.The main options include:2) Body Test - this allows you to take (or re-take) the Body Test3) The Balance Board - when there's an exclamation point over the Balance Board it means he has a message for you. The little guy is full of interesting tips (you'll learn all you ever wanted to know about METs, or Metabolic EquivalenTS, for example).4) User Settings - clicking on your Mii will let you adjust your height, birthdate, calendar stamp design, trainer (creepy male dude or the creepy female dudette from Wii Fit who's slightly less creepy than she was before), outfit, privacy settings (whether you want pictures taken or a password to be entered to access your profile), and even when the date should change over to the next day (either 12 AM or 3 AM for those who work out after midnight).5) Fit Meter - you can click on the Fit meter to learn more about it or to register your Fit Meter (and unlock the trial).6) Training - this is the "meat" of the game where you can access all the training activities.When you click on Training, the menu has these options:A) "Select Exercise" will let you choose an individual activity to exercise to. For each exercise, you'll see the number of METs expended, as well as the number of times you've done the exercise and whether the Balance Board is required. The categories of activities are the same as in Wii Fit Plus, with addition of a new "Dance" category. The activities consist of some old exercises that have been carried over from Wii Fit and Wii Fit Plus, as well as some brand new ones.The categories are:i) Yoga (18 activities): here, you basically follow an on-screen trainer and mimic him or her in various yoga activities. These are mostly the same Yoga exercises from the original Wii Fit, including deep breathing, half-moon, warrior, tree, sun salutation, standing knee, palm tree, chair, triangle, downward-facing dog, dance, cobra, bridge, spinal twist, and shoulder stand. In addition, there are three new activities: spine extension, gate, and grounded V.ii) Strength Training (15 activities): As with the original Wii Fit, these exercises are meant for strengthening specific parts of your body. Again, you follow an on-screen trainer and again, these are mostly the same strength training activities from Wii Fit. They include single leg extension, push-up and side plank, torso twists, jackknife, lunge, rowing squat, single-leg twist, sideways leg lift, plank, tricep extension, arm-and-leg lift, and single-arm stand. The three new activities are balance bridge, side lunge, and single-leg reach.iii) Aerobics (15 activities): These are exercises that promote aerobic activity. They include a number of the same games from Wii Fit, including hula hoop, super hula hoop, basic step, advanced step, free step, rhythm boxing, basic run, two-person run, free run, island cycling, and driving range. Most of these games are the same as before, but many have interesting enhancements. For example, on the Hula Hoop, you can now twirl hoops not just with your waist but with your wrists as well with the Wii Remote Plus. On Island Cycling, the graphics are much improved, and as you "bike" you can see a beautiful day turn to a beautiful sunset and then turn into a starry evening, reminiscent of Walk It Out. Many of these activities also have a new "extra" mode that provides an additional level of challenge beyond the original.In addition, they have four brand new Aerobics activities. (BTW, I've provided descriptions of all the new activities here; if you want to read about the old activities that have been ported over, you can check out my review onWii Fit Plusfrom five years ago).- Puzzle Squash - here, you use both the Wii Remote Plus and the Balance Board. You basically have to use the Wii Remote to hit a squash ball, and "walk" on the Balance Board to get your player to move to the right position in a sort of 3D version of "Breakout". It's a simple concept and fairly easy to master, but also surprisingly addictive.- Free Boxing - this uses the Balance Board, the Wii Remote Plus, and either the nunchuk or another Wii Remote Plus. This game is a lot like the Rhythm Boxing game except you're using both your hands and your feet to punch in certain patterns.- Orienteering - this one is like the basic run, in that you're travelling through Wii Fit Island. The difference is that you're not using the Balance Board or the Wii Remote Plus, but you're holding the GamePad in your hands.  As you walk in place, the accelerometer and gyroscope in the GamePad can detect that you're moving and if you're turning to the left or right, and your Mii will respond accordingly. It's a "hide and seek" type game where you're walking around the island looking for Miis whose photos you see on your GamePad. You need to remember your surroundings and different faces, but you can always ask a random Mii for help too.- Rowing Crew - This one uses the Balance Board and a Wii Remote Plus. You can either site on a chair and put your feet on the Balance Board or (as I prefer), sit right on the Balance Board. You then grasp your Wii Remote with both hands, and make a rowing motion by bending your body up and down almost as if you're doing sit-ups. You need to use the right technique-row to the cadence that your coxswain is setting, match your fellow crew members, and make sure your oar is out of the water when you're not rowing by rotating the Wii remote the right way. You can see a first-person view on your GamePad and a side view on your TV. This one is hilarious-when you don't row properly to the rhythm all your fellow rowers in your boat look back at you and give you dirty looks. But once you get the hang of it it feels remarkably authentic-and gives you a great aerobic workout.iv) Dance (8 activities): I wasn't sure what to expect with this one. The first thing to know is that this is isn't a clone of Just Dance or Zumba Fitness. Rather, it's a simplistic but still pretty clever set of step aerobics exercises that actually come close to simulating the basics of actual dance moves. You work out with the Balance Board and two Wii Remote Pluses, and basically have to move your arms and feet to match the trainer. There's a wide variety of music with unique "moves" that let you work out different parts of your body. Hula music lets you relax, jazzy music helps you work your waist and thighs, hip-hop music lets you work out your thighs, locking let you work out your upper arms, flamenco lets you work out your arms and legs, salsa lets you work out your shoulders and back, and burning beats gives you a calorie burning challenge. The first time you run through the dance the instructor will give you an explanation of the moves, but then after that you can dance all you want.v) Balance Games (18 activities): In every version of Wii Fit, this has always been the section of the game that's the most fun, and it's true with this game as well. Returning are old favorites from the original Wii Fit like Soccer Heading, Ski Jump, Table Tilt, Rhythm Kung Fu, Ski Slalom, Perfect 10, Snowball Fight, Obstacle Course, Tilt City, Balance Bubble, Bird's Eye Bulls-Eye. But they have a number of fun new games as well. As with Wii Fit, there's a Beginner level and an Advanced level to unlock for each activity. And as before you're not necessarily going to get a very strenuous workout from these games; they're more designed to help you improve your balance and coordination vs. provide you strength or aerobic training. And they're a blast to play with friends and family.The new Balance Games include:- Trampoline Target - This is a fun one that uses the Balance Board where you're jumping on a trampoline. The only problem is, you still can't actually jump on the Balance Board, so you have to bend and then extend your legs at the right time, and then when you're in the air you need to shift your weight to "steer" yourself back over the target in the middle of the trampoline. The more accurate you are with your "jumps" and your targeting, the higher your next jump will be. Like a lot of the others, this activity makes great use of the GamePad by showing you a top-down view on the GamePad and a side view on the TV. This one is a whole lot of fun, and works your legs, hips and overall balance, but it takes a while to get used to not actually jumping (as with earlier versions of Wii Fit, if you do accidentally jump the game clears your progress and resets to the beginning). I give this a 4 out of 5 for fun, and a 4 out of 5 for exercise.- Hosedown - This one uses the GamePad and the Balance Board. You hold the GamePad in front of you and point it at the TV. Miis will throw mud balls at you and you have to hose them down with water. You press one foot down on the Balance Board to spray the water, lift your foot off the Board to refill your water tank, and use the GamePad to aim and shoot at specific targets, while the TV has a wide angle view of the scene. I get the sense this one doesn't really give very much exercise (1 out of 5), but it's so fun (5 out of 5) it doesn't really matter.- Dessert Course - This game is pure genius. You're a waiter in a crowded restaurant who has to collect desserts from the chefs situated in the corners of the room and deliver them to people standing and waving you down throughout the room. You hold your GamePad flat like a tray (balancing your desserts on it), walk in place on the Balance Board, and "steer" by rotating your tray like a horizontal steering wheel. You see a first-person view of the room on the TV-and a first-person view of the desserts on your tray on the GamePad (which look delicious)! As you advance in the game, you start getting all kinds of desserts, from jelly rolls and round cream puffs that roll off your tray to jiggling cups of pudding and have to try to deliver them without bumping into your guests. This one is probably a 3 out of 5 for exercise, but easily a 5 out of 5 for fun.- Ultimate Obstacle Course - I think back in the day I described the Wii Fit obstacle course as sort of a "3D Super Mario Bros", and wrote that I wished it could be longer and have more variety. Happily, this game delivers on that. As with the original version of this game, you walk in place on the Balance Board and try to avoid obstacles like giant rolling balls and falling off cliffs. Something new is the ability to "turn" by turning your feet on the Balance Board while walking in place, admittedly something it took me a while to get used to, with with enough practice I finally figured it out. This one is a 4 out of 5 for exercise (mainly because you'll be playing it over and over until you get it right). As for fun, it's a bit frustrating at first as you try to figure out the "turn in place" thing, but once you do it's a ton of fun. A nice bonus is that your Wii Gamepad displays an overhead map of the course.- Core Luge - This is another of those really cool simulations that almost feels like the real thing. You sit on the balance board and just like a real luger, you start out on the course by pushing off with your hands to get some speed, and then lean back and navigate the luge course by moving your butt. Exercise value is about a 2 (you really don't work out your core as much as you'd hope), but fun value is a 4 or a 5.- Scuba Search - This is a treasure hunt game that uses the Balance Board and the GamePad where you're a diver searching for different kinds of fish and treasure. You can see a first-person view on the GamePad, and a map of the entire area on the TV. You basically shift the weight on your legs to make your diver swim, and you can bend and straighten your knees to make him zip forward. This one reminded me a little of Endless Ocean for the Wii. It has a lot of replay value because you're always wanting to go back and find the fish or the treasure you missed. I give it a 3 for exercise value and a 4 for fun.- Climbing - This is a rock climbing game that uses the Balance Board and two Wii Remote Pluses. You use the Wii remotes to grab towards the rocks (pressing A to grip them), and use walk in place on the Balance Board to climb. Technique and speed are important: you need to grab onto small (red) or medium (blue) rocks with one hand, and large (green) rocks with two hands, keeping your balance the whole time just like in real life. 3 for exercise value, 5 for fun.Other options under "Training" include the following:B) Personal Trainer will let you input a certain goal (for example, calories you'd like to burn in a workout session, amount of exercise time, type of exercise, and activity level), and will put together a custom workout for you pulling together different activities and exercises.C) Wii Fit U Routines are collections of routines (made up of three specially selected activities each) that are designed to help you work out specific goals, such as easing tension in your shoulders and back, relaxing, trimming your waistline, improving your posture, and even helping with your digestion and circulation.D) My Routine allows you to put together your own custom workouts based on your favorite activities.E) Ranking shows you statistics of how many times you've played each activity, which activities you've played most recently, and the total amount of calories burned and time spent playing each activity.F) Finally, there's a Group option that lets you select a group to work out with. You'll be able to view the group's statistics and leaderboards as a way to further incentivize you to work out.There are substantial improvements in the Wii U version of the game:- For Yoga and Strength Training, unlike with previous versions of the game, you can choose either a male or female trainer. The female trainer has gotten a bit of a makeover-she has a little more color and definition than before doesn't look at pale and ghostly as she once did. They're done an amazing job with the trainer's animation so you can see exactly what the proper form is from any angle. You can use the GamePad or Wii remote's arrow buttons to get a 360 degree view of the trainer from any angle, and use the 1 and 2 buttons (or X and Y buttons) to zoom in and out to get a close-up view.- For Yoga, Strength Training, and Dance, there's a new feature called "mirror mode" that lets you see an actual video image of yourself next to the trainer. This one is a little tricky to set up-you definitely need a GamePad stand, and you need to put it in just the right place, preferably about 5 or more feet away from you (obviously, you'll need to do the navigating with a Wii remote instead of the GamePad). Once you get it set up right, you can see a real-time video of yourself next to the Wii Fit U trainer, and you can match his or her moves precisely. The system doesn't attempt to use video to judge if you're using the right form, but you can easily eyeball whether you're doing the moves correctly or not.- You can press the "-" button to swap the action between your Wii GamePad and the TV. This way, if you or someone wants to watch TV, you can continue your exercise unabated.- After you finish an individual exercise you'll get a recommendation of which one to do next.- As I've mentioned the game makes great use of the GamePad to provide a new dimension (literally) to many of the activities. It adds a lot more depth to the games to be able to view the action from multiple angles.- Your "piggy bank" of calories and time expended in the lower right-hand corner has a personality now and will change colors and hop around as you progress in the game.- I like how there's an option to switch players without having to restart the game, for situations at parties or family gatherings where you want to take turns playing. Speaking of taking turns playing, there's also an option on the main menu to load up certain games where users can compete against each other by taking turns. I would have liked to see them support multiple balance boards for head-to-head action, but it looks like that's just something they're going to support.As for negatives, I have to admit there aren't many. I do have the same gripe with Wii Fit U that I had with Wii Fit, that many of the activities (even the aerobics and strength training ones) are so short they don't really get your heart pumping at an elevated rate at a vigorous or even a moderate intensity zone. But then again if you string enough activities together and do them in a rapid-fire you can certainly get close. My other gripe is about the GamePad battery-it runs out way too fast, especially when you're trying to use it as your main screen, so you basically have to keep it plugged in most of the time.All in all, Wii Fit U gets a solid 5 out of 5 stars from me. It's that good. It takes all the best things from the original Wii Fit and Wii Fit Plus, but also adds a lot of enhancements and new features that take full advantage of the Wii U. For example, graphics are faster and cleaner, and the GamePad isn't just a gimmick like it is in some other games-they did a great job of using it to really enhance the enjoyment of the game. There are enough new activities to make the game feel fresh and new, and yet they kept enough of the old to keep it familiar. And the games are easy to learn, but have great replay value as well, something great for workouts or friendly competition between family and friends.Would I go so far as to say that if you don't have a Wii U, that this game is so good that you should run out and get one? It really depends. If you're just looking at the Wii U solely for fitness gaming, there are a growing number of alternatives out there such as the Xbox One's Xbox Fitness service (which "gamifies" old exercise videos), products such asGoji Play) which let you turn your iPhone or iPad into an exergaming system, and of course a ton of fitness trackers from the likes of FitBit, Nike, and Jawbone that let you track daily activity. Each of these has their strengths and weaknesses.That said, if you're already considering the Wii U because you to play some of the excellent first-party games that have recently been released such as The Legend of Zelda, Pikmin 3, or Super Mario 3D World (or upcoming games like Mario Kart 8 or Super Smash Bros), I'd say Wii Fit U is definitely a title that would put me over the edge. Many of the new fitness activities are a ton of fun just to play as games, the Wii Fit Meter makes a viable alternative to the more expensive FitBit or Nike Fuel for tracking daily activity, and for all of its recent struggles, Nintendo is still the one to beat for the humor, creativity, and originality in their games.
First of all, I have something important to share with y'all.  The last Zelda game I played from beginning to end was Link to the Past and this was back in June of 1995.  This means, despite briefly playing a few segments from Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask a few years later, I actually went 17 YEARS without owning or completing another Zelda game!  Is that insane?  Yes!  You're probably wondering... why the long wait?  Sometime in the late 90's I really felt it was time to take an extended break after going strong with a video game obsession (arguably TOO strong) for 10 straight years.  What a long wait, haha.  I just HAD to give in to my temptations and play another Zelda game.  Too many years, too many sequels.  I figure that owning a Wii is pointless unless I have a collection of quality games to play.  Then... I read a couple articles and found out when Skyward Sword was going to be releasd (in November of last year) and the rest is history.  Anyway, after Twilight Princess, it took 5 years for Skyward Sword to be released and the million dollar question is, was it worth the wait?  Simply put, yes.  Probably not a confident or resounding "YES, it was worth it!" but just... a yes.  Let's break down several crucial elements of the game.The motion controls.  This is the number one reason many gamers have been divided with mixed feelings.  Some people admire them, others... not so much.  My impression so far is this- the general longtime Zelda fan dislikes the motion controls because they'd rather have the traditional way they've grown accustomed to, wherea non-serious gamers (or those who haven't been following Zelda for 25 years, such as myself) admire the motion controls and believe they're innovative.  I admit, at first I wasn't sold on the controls.  My initial feelings were that the controls were designed to mess with players concerning every single obstacle in the game (which isn't true).  In fact you can say I was downright irritated with the controls.  However as I played through a couple dungeons, I began to realize that swinging the Wii remote around and pretending it's a sword *is* actually a pretty cool idea.  Not only a cool idea, but the right evolution for the Zelda series.  How many generic sword-fighting games have there been on the market over the years?  It's only appropriate that one of the original sword swingers in Link is responsible for such a radically different gameplay change.Not only are these motion controls a "pretty cool" idea, now it's going to be difficult for me to go back to *not* swinging the remote around.  The most astonishing thing is that Nintendo made several of the enemies and puzzles so that you HAVE to be precise with your aim and yet it's hardly ever irritating to execute... with a few exceptions that I'll mention below.  If for example, an enemy is holding a sword above their head, this means you can't swing up to down because they'll block it.  You CAN swing down to up however (or swing from the opposite direction, depending how the enemy protects itself).  Precision!  The skeleton mini bosses you encounter later on are notable here.  They frequently alternate the position of their sword used to block/protect their body parts, testing your sword-swinging skills in the process.  If they block one of your swings, simply move out of their way and they won't retaliate.  Alright if you're standing too close to them after they block... they'll probably retaliate THEN (a couple seconds later).  The good news is that moves are almost always blocked in a way that actually allows time on your part to react accordingly, so you never feel like the game is being cheap or overaggressive.  So even if you were to attack an area of an enemy that's protecting itself, they won't respond immediately with a cheapshot.  They'll wait a couple seconds like I mention above.  Nintendo definitely realized how frustrating it would have been if enemies and bosses did attack without delay.  What may SEEM cheap or unfair initially is usually a result of not knowing how to tackle an enemy.  Basically, there's a fairly strong learning curve present that never really lets up, and enemy movements stall to allow the player enough time to figure these movements out for themselves.  Later on however, when you're required to be at a certain skill level, enemies (especially bosses) DO become more violent and aggressive.  Still, nothing overbearing that you can't handle with practice.Some people -actually MOST people- dislike Link's swimming movements.  It's actually not that hard after 30 minutes of practice.  You have to tilt the remote up, down, left or right and Link will swim in that direction.  If you feel he moves too slow, well, luckily the game designers understood how slow underwater movements can be, which is why they added a spin move ability that can temporarily boost speed.  The spin has a few other advantages that you'll discover soon enough (such as being able to leap out of water completely and land on platforms unreachable by simply floating to the surface and trying to climb out).  Now that I'm going through the game again, I can swim WAY more accurately this time.  At first my problem was that I couldn't get out of the water and attach to the vines on the wall (that appear in quite a few spots) but now I can't believe I even HAD that problem since my skills have improved so much.  Also, another complaint is your Loftwing- a flying red bird that Link rides on top of and uses as transportation as he travels through the sky.  You'll need a bird ride the entire way through the game.  Just about everyone agrees that the bird moves WAY too slow and since you're riding the bird frequently (at least 100-150 times total) it takes forever just to get from point A to point B.  It's true.  I can't deny it!  However there's ways you can temporarily increase speed with two different types of speed boosts- one of them by hitting the A button and your bird will pick up speed even though the increase is honestly ineffective and barely noticeable, but a much BETTER way is to find these rock structures high in the air that you can fly through.  These REALLY make you fly faster.  You'll know when you see one because it has a clear circle in the middle of it.  Always try to fly through these.Oh and on another note, I initially had NO idea what I was supposed to do at the map screen with the beacons.  I didn't understand the entire concept.  You place beacons on the map to indicate where you want (or need) to go.  Beacons give off a faint blue funnel of light in the sky exactly where you set them on the map.  It's just amazing that you can actually set these beacons at specific points to indicate where your destination is.  To me this is a thing of genius and makes searching for crucial items a LOT easier!  The perfect solution to a HUGE and often times confusing 3D game!  The problem is that the blue light is SO faint, that many times you have to be close to the beacon just to see it.  Perhaps Nintendo was going for realism here with the clouds blowing by and blocking your vision for a a short time, who knows.  I'd say *most* of the time you can see the blue light.  Every once in a while though, the dust particles and clouds make it hard to see the beacon light.I STRONGLY disagree with the many complaints I've read that the characters occupying the land of Skyloft have little to no personality.  Really?  I think they completely smear the townspeople from Link to the Past and I LOVE that classic game so I'm by no means criticizing it.  Most everyone at the store in Skyloft (the main area where you'll be spending most of your time and where you buy your items and equipment) are memorable- the depressed/downbeat Item Check woman who totally reminds me of several women that I've met in real life who are bored to tears by their routine job, the "boisterous when you're standing across his counter/easily disappointed the moment you walk away" man who sells shields, bombs, arrows and slingshot bags (and who has a hidden angry side to his demeanor) the huge-eyed fortune teller that gives me the creeps the way his eyes can gaze into your soul, the woman and her husband stirring potion with a screaming baby riding the husbands back, the ADORABLE Kina (wouldn't you like her as a girlfriend?) the sarcastic/ignorant robot named Scrapper you meet later who LOVES to get under your skin and insult Link at every opportunity, and... here's the REALLY interesting part.  You can actually sleep in beds scattered around peoples homes and make it nighttime, which means you can go to the homes of these people, have conversations with them and find out what they're REALLY like.  More often than not, this results in many errands and side quests.I admit when I first explored the town at night, I was totally caught up in the atmosphere of evil cats and blue blobs coming out of the ground, and the scenery feels so much like a beach setting with the wind blowing everything around.  Other times, such as when you visit a place called Lumpy Pumpkin, you can stare into the night sky and feel complete peace like you're in outer space.  It reminds me of the loneliness associated with being alone somewhere far away in the galaxy, or a dream-like state.  It's wonderful.  All criticisms about the game having frequent graphical glitches (I played through the entire game and encountered none- then again I grew up from the NES generation so I've learned to ignore them) or lackluster townspeople, or the fact that you still have to read several chapters of dialogue as opposed to hearing characters actually speak are all greatly exaggerated.  These supposed complaints are not only tolerable, but forgiveable.  I think Zelda fans set their expectations too high concerning advancements that may or may not have been true, and were simply let down with the final product.  Since I haven't been following the Zelda series all these years, it's very easy for me to overlook these "faults".  Then again knowing Nintendo, they probably led people into thinking Skyward Sword *would* have all these features only to end up removing them at the last minute.  I wouldn't be surprised.Speaking of the bosses, I've heard many complaints that they all have a similar weak point- that being, an eye.  An eye that sometimes takes forever to open up and reveal itself by way of having to attack other areas of the body for an extended period of time, or an eye that is just cleverly hidden and you have to search for it.  Maybe I'd complain if it wasn't so much fun slashing at the eye giving the player a feeling of accomplishment when it finally opens up.  Not only that, but finding it and letting loose with sword combos produces an awesome jolt of electricity through my veins!  Now I admit I'm actually TERRIBLE at combos in this game (and most games for that matter).  I've seen the video walkthroughs of gamers and they can blaze through enemy-infested areas by simply swinging the remote a certain way and destroying everything with a few nifty sword combos and make Link appear to be a walking path of destruction, but unfortunately all my attempts at combos leave me swinging the remote like a madman and missing my targets, haha.Let's focus on the dungeons.  Most of them are very good.  As usual, they start off short and fairly easy and gradually get tougher.  At least in this game almost ALL the dungeons have identity and beautiful eye candy backgrounds to admire.  In the first dungeon for example (Skyview Temple) you eventually arrive to the middle part with a really high structure in the middle of the room, and the atmosphere here can best be described as peaceful and dreamy.  It's quite unusual and I absolutely love it.  It doesn't really give off a sense of danger with a boss fight coming up soon, however.  More like a temporary feeling of tranquility, or a brief moment of relaxation.  The dungeons continue with several distinctive designs (especially Ancient Cistern with a perfect blend of water, lily pads, vines and my favorite, the blue rocks in the underground section) until perhaps the final dungeon of the game (called Sky Keep) which is definitely NOT disappointing from a challenge or obstacle-driven point of view, but lacks atmosphere because it simply repeats what's already been done throughout the game.  Not a fan of the final dungeon as a result.  Plus the slide puzzle is... ugh!  You have to operate a slide puzzle that consists of panels and you have to move them a certain way to open the next section of the castle.  It's confusing and truthfully, I had to resort to a guide to figure it out.  There's several possibilities to the puzzle but I couldn't find any of the right ones.The reason I'm taking off one point from the overall final rating is... well, 3 reasons. The first reason is Fi.  Fi is a female spirit that FREQUENTLY pops up and tells Link what to do and where to go throughout the *entire* quest.  However her assistance is a little overbearing and unnecessary to say the least.  Now for people like me who struggle at games, I didn't mind Fi nearly as much as those who already know what to do given their quick thinking or video game-minded abilities to easily comprehend obstacles (or the fact they've been following the Zelda series all along and therefore understand exactly how the obstacles are normally presented).  I can totally see why hardcore Zelda followers would strongly dislike Fi.  The other reason I can't give Skyward Sword a 5-star rating is because the cutscenes are plentiful and sometimes last 10 minutes at a time.  People are not exaggerating when they say it takes at least 90 minutes for the actual gameplay to get underway in the beginning.  This stuff really only serves a purpose for storyline progression (very little of it impactful, in fact) but it's cliched, uninteresting and takes WAY too long to sit through (or stand through, hehe).  Other than a few segments here and there, most of the beginning focuses on your Loftwing (flying bird), how to control him (which is useful information I admit, though actually not descriptive enough so you might get confused with the instructions), competing in a little bird race in the skies, diving off buildings (or rather, being shoved!), LOUSY and cliched interaction between Link and Zelda (and her father) that you've probably heard in several other fairy tale stories, Fi introducting herself, several townspeople stopping to have a chat with Link, etc.  All this adds up to 90 minutes of unnecessary dialogue scrolling and it *is* overbearing.However the one complaint that people don't seem to have that I most certainly do lies in the dungeons and how they were designed.  They're memorable, don't get me wrong.  They have atmosphere, they have challenge, and they're even extremely fun most of the time.  It's the fact they're always ALWAYS so puzzle-oriented.  It really seems like *every single room* is a new puzzle.  Now my definition of "puzzle" is simply "Something that stands in the way of progression".  This means having to use your items (and your brain) to make your way forward.  However SO much attention was given to the layout that if you think you can just blow through the game bombing walls, shooting arrows and lighting candles like you did in the 2D games and that will easily solve your problems, you're in for a rude awakening!  Be alert- REALLY alert.  Look at your surroundings VERY carefully and several times over.  It's quite often difficult to figure out which item to use whenever it appears you've reached a dead end.  Not only a matter of which item, but trickiness in HOW to use them.  Tricky design that's both a blessing (because it's admirable and clever and makes you think "Ah, THAT'S how you access the next room") and a curse (because it takes away from the adventurous theme Zelda has been known for and sometimes leaves you stumped for hours, and being stuck in one spot quickly makes ANY game less fun).  In relation to the plethora of puzzles are the tasks throughout the game.  I'm not necessarily referring to the townspeople and the type of favors they ask out of the player (even though they're the source of most of the tasks) but just the fact the way the game is designed.  "You do this, now go over there and do that... now come back and do this... now make your way to this island and do THAT!" etc.  It can be anything from Fi asking you to go somewhere, to searching for and chatting with an important person anywhere across the lands, to... who knows.  Even the dungeons themselves are guilty of needless tasks.  A task-oriented game which ends up distracting the player from simply having *fun*.  You have to REALLY be into the storyline to not care or notice any of these needless distractions, and you have to be willing to forgive Nintendo for making exploration a thing of the past.  Plus you need to be a quick puzzle solver or frustration will kick in sooner rather than later.The items are pretty good though.  You already know about the bow & arrow and bombs- two trademark Zelda items.  Embarrassingly, there was a VERY lengthy learning curve for me in picking up, tossing, rolling and collecting the bombs.  Boy 3D movements can be tricky at times!  For several HOURS I kept hitting the wrong button and blowing myself up, LOL!  To be fair, sometimes the bombs don't toss the way they should.  You're supposed to flick the remote and sometimes the game doesn't know which command you're going for and therefore it gets stuck, which means Link holds onto the bomb and goes boom boom!  When the bomb doesn't flick and is ready to blow, your instinct is to hit a button in frustation... probably the same button that sets the bomb on the ground in front of you and yeah... boom boom, lol.  I look back and laugh now but it wasn't funny while learning!  The slingshot is good but you never need it again after the halfway point of the game so there's no point in upgrading it.  The mechanical beetle is a VERY useful item- you can launch it into the sky and discover new areas and items that are unreachable for Link by himself, or in my case, you can use the beetle to explore all around and get a sneak peek at what's ahead.  The clawshot is awesome- you can grip specific targets but unfortunately you can't use it as a weapon on enemies.  Darn!  Remember peahats?  They were floating enemies from the original Legend of Zelda that could be found in the overworld.  Sort of annoying and pesky in that game, but purposeful here.  Now you can actually use the clawshot to grip onto them to reach higher, distant platforms.  Some peahats even float directly upwards.  VERY creative and useful.Oh and the bug catching net is REALLY realistic given the motion controls.  You have to literally sneak up slowly with the net hanging out so the bugs (or birds) don't suspect that anything is odd with their surroundings, which could startle them and cause them to fly away.  Yeah it's pretty realistic.  You can't just swing the bug net wildly like I was and expect the bugs to willingly fly into your net, lol!  Patience and persistence is needed here.  Still, it's not hard after a while.  There's even an optional bug catching mini game later on that will test your skills.  You can upgrade a bigger net just like you can upgrade most weapons for better results.  Bugs are also used to make stronger potions.  You can actually upgrade potions so they have TWO servings, which means -with 5 bottles- you can fill your life meter a grand total of 10 times!  And hey, you just might NEED 10 servings against the final boss fight too!  Oh boy is he not only intimidating, but VERY tough!  His name is Demise.  How appropriate!The mini games are probably a weak point but it's easy for me to dismiss them.  The clown game at Fun Fun Island STINKS!  You have to use the motion controls to dive through 5 rings without missing a single one *and* land on a specific space below, and that's how you get a piece of heart for your heart container (in case you don't know, 4 heart pieces complete the heart so your life meter extends just like in the older games).  This particular mini game is, simply put, a *nightmare*.  And the clown has the nerve to insult you whenever you lose and sometimes even talks down to you like a crybaby.  UGH!  The mine cart mini game (which isn't a mini game at first- you have to come back later) is another difficult one because you're required to tilt the remote to either pick up speed or slow down at specific points.  You HAVE to do it the right way or you'll either fly off or lose considerable speed!  These are timed races so memorizing the track and being nearly perfect is VERY important.  These are the two most difficult challenges in the game, no doubt about it.  Neither one is a requirement though.  The only required challenging mini game that you HAVE to complete is when your Loftwing is in the process of learning an important attack spin for a boss fight, and you have to destroy 10 targets in 2 minutes in order to be granted the spin move.  Perfect accuracy is a requirement, but memorizing where the targets are makes things a lot easier.Also, you will occasionally come across these huge blocks called Goddess Cubes in the lands below.  Smacking one with a specific upward sword strike activates the treasure chests located on the tiny islands up in the sky that you reach with the Loftwing.  Luckily the map indicates which islands and treasure chests have been activated (with a purple chest symbol) otherwise you'd be flying around forever trying to find them!  It's probably a good idea to search for these islands/treasure chests after hitting a few Goddess Cubes so you aren't wandering from island to island *too* many times.  Not that there's consequences if you don't open them as soon as they're available- but the treasure chests up there contain some pretty useful things.  Plus these specific treasure chests seem to follow along with the game so waiting too long to open them might eventually make them irrelevant.  Also, you do NOT need to farm for rupees in this game!  Skyward Sword is very generous with rupees whether it be because you will often find chests and secrets that contain anywhere from 100-300 rupees, or because you can collect numerous items that can be traded at a certain store for up to 1,000 rupees... yeah, very generous.  It's not like the Skyloft store charges outrageous prices for items, potions and upgrades either.In fact, get this- I recommend just *ignoring* green rupees completely.  They're pointless.  Pretend they're not even there!  Go for the blue and red rupees (worth 5 and 20 respectively).  You can even sell some of the collectible items (either found inside chests or from enemy drops) such as the ever popular Amber Relics and the mightiest item of all (Goddess Plumes) to a man downtown who honestly gives you WAY more rupees than he should.  I realize you should be rewarded for collecting them, but each Amber Relic is worth 30 rupees and the Goddess Plume is worth 100.  That's a LOT, trust me!  It really feels like green rupees don't even have a purpose in the game.  Maybe they're becoming meaningless or outdated?  Speaking of pointless things, get THIS!  You don't even need your shield the entire time.  Alright maybe the first battle with the skeleton pirate that goes by the name Scervo requires a shield in order to block some of his sword swipes (in fact you *do* for round 3) but other than that?  You don't need a shield anywhere else in the game.  To me this is *very* shocking.  It just goes to show that the shield is apparently optional in Zelda games.  At least in the 3 games I've played from beginning to end.  Not even anytime during the final dungeon or the boss fights at the end of the game.  Update- it turns out in Hero Mode you DO need a shield for Demise because he takes away 4 hearts from a certain dangerous charge attack, and you will need to block that.  Also, since I brought up Hero Mode, it's supposed to be an additional challenge after you complete the regular game since no hearts are present anywhere (until you find the Heart Medal that is) so I recommend having a healthy collection of Blessed Butterflys, Woodland Beetles, Volcanic Ladybugs, Sand Cicadas, Eldin Rollers and Deku Hornets before taking on Demise at the end of the original (first) adventure so all challenges in the beginning of Hero Mode are easier to deal with.As you've probably read about, there's only 3 areas that you can explore.  The green grassy lands of Faron Woods, the lava-covered volcano world of Eldin Volcano, and the desert and secluded areas of Lanyru Desert.  However it's important to note that there's *several* areas to these 3 worlds.  They're most definitely not short.  You can't blaze through them.  Faron Woods, Eldin Volcano and Lanyru Desert open and reveal more as the game goes on.  Yes you will be repeating over the areas you already explored more often than not in order to GET to the new areas, but since there's always something new to discover, it's really not a chore.  Oh... the stamina meter.  That DARN thing!  Link can run for a certain (limited) period of time.  If you make Link run for too long, he'll run out of steam (as evident by an irritating beeping sound).  However it's important to stop running RIGHT before the meter runs out *completely* otherwise Link will tire out and stagger around for a few seconds until he returns to normal.  You do NOT want to find yourself out of breath when surrounded by enemies and with a few hearts remaining, so keep an eye on that meter.  Yes I hate it too.  It will *constantly* be annoying as you eagerly want to run nonstop across a lengthy hallway only to be forced to slow down and stop thanks to the stamina meter running low.  Also maybe it's just me, but the temporary stamina boosts you occasionally stumble across (especially in Skyloft) always seem to be sitting in inconvenient places where I'm required to veer to the side to grab them, and oh, if this happens to be your first 3D Zelda game, expect to miss items constantly.  Since it's 3D, there's a tendency to run circles around an item a few times before actually picking it up.  It's fairly annoying but you can't really help it- being off a bit and finding yourself in a situation where you're missing items is just the nature of 3D gaming.  Not a major problem of course, and you'll adjust with practice and time.As far as enemies, well truth be told several areas of the land are empty in that regard.  Even fairly large portions in a few cases.  Not really unacceptable since there's usually atmosphere and beautiful graphics serving as a replacement.  Both the overworld and dungeons feature significantly less enemies than say, the older 2D Zelda games.  The only enemy encountered frequently (besides bats and bokoblins which can be dismissed as being non-threatening) also happens to be the most irritating of the bunch- these blobs (called chuchus) that suddenly come out of the ground as you're walking or running by.  They always happen to pop out of the ground RIGHT when you're a few steps in front of them and catching you completely by surprise, which means you'll be shaking the nunchuk/remote constantly to shove them off (because they love to squeeze Link's body!).  The ones that give off an electrical charge are the worst- your immediate instinct after being attacked is to swing your sword and retaliate however... the game desigers were apparently aware of this which means the moment you shake one away, they will electrify RIGHT as you're swinging the sword which means you'll get shocked and lose another heart.  Yes, VERY annoying.  Another popular enemy is called deku baba which are the blue and yellow plants that are mostly found in the grassy parts or the hilltops.  They take full advantage of the motion controls.  In fact they're one of the very first enemies you run into.  It's actually sort of important to perfect your swings against these guys- when they open their mouths a certain way, you have to swing the remote in that direction and trust me, you have to be accurate or they'll quickly close their mouths and block the shot.  I recommend practicing on these guys for a while and getting comfortable with their movements because they indicate more demanding sword swinging precision up ahead.I could nag about a few minor things such as the fact you have to repeat a boss battle with an enemy that goes by the name the Imprisoned up to 3 times, but those battles are short and there's a trick in making them MUCH easier (hint, whirlwinds).  Oh, and the harp can be a pain to play in a few isolated places (such as the lady in Sealed Grounds who teaches Link how to play it- she's very demanding and expects perfection out of the player) but the good news is that nobody else in the game expects perfection when it's time to play the harp again.  Basically you play the harp like this- hold down the A button, and wave the remote back and forth with the rhythm of the music.  It's not quite as easy as it sounds, and for whatever reason the notes frequently get jumbled, but how the notes are organized doesn't seem to matter at all- simply waving the remote correctly is where it counts.  I also DESPISE walking across tightropes.  Even worse some tightropes have bombs attached to the side or underneath the rope itself, which means when you're cautiously walking across and one explodes, you'll fall and have to climb back up and attempt to walk across again.  The problem is that walking across tightropes is easier said than done- you have to *really* tilt the remote from left to right (or right to left depending which side Link is leaning) in order to stay balanced.  The good news is that when you fall, Link will hold onto the rope with his hands and you can climb across by hanging (with the exception of bomb explosions that immediately knock Link off) or just hit Up on the analog stick to continue walking across the rope.  And when you fall off a rope or platform, you don't actually lose any hearts (unless it's REALLY high).  Oh and whenever you fall into a bottomless pit, the game is normally generous enough to bring you back close to where you fell.  Sometimes they're *too* generous and take you to where you need to be, lol.Oh wait, I just remembered!  BIG complaint coming!  The boat rides.  They are flat out boring and undeveloped.  The boat is only there so you can reach your next destination island and in one example, used to locate a ghost ship and fire cannonballs at it.  The developers *definitely* should have added more here.  These boat rides are only a few minutes long and the surrounding enemies are never really a threat, if at all.  Why bother throwing in a boat segment to the game if it feels incomplete?  Oh well, the boat rides are only 3-5 minutes total and it's over and done with, but still, more excitement should have occurred because the way it is, it feels like it's missing something.  I don't know, maybe the ability to go fishing or collect items on top of the water as you drive by or better yet, compete in a mini game or speed race where you can perfect your skills dodging several of the tiny islands in the middle of the water.  *Something* more should have been added.  Simply picking up speed and slowing down your boat isn't interesting enough.Let's see, what else can I mention.  You start the game with 6 hearts instead of 3 and I imagine the reason is that Nintendo figured people would struggle with the motion controls so they chose to give the player 6 hearts right out of the gate.  Hey I'm not complaining- there were several times when I *needed* those extra hearts!  The heart container pieces are sometimes cleverly hidden but more often than not, it's obvious where they are.  Hey, Link to the Past was guilty of obvious to spot heart pieces as well but that game's still -and forever will be- awesome to the max.  You can collect these items called gratitute crystals for helping people around town with chores and errands.  Some of these crystals can even be found scattered around town (only at night though).  80 might seem like a lot, but there's several instances where you get 5 at a time, so 80 isn't really much.  The ones you find around town are worth 1, but the chores and errands are worth 5.  Gratitude crystals are simply a way to expand the story and further develop the characters, and nothing more.  Innocent fun basically.
For me Super Mario 3D World is only a passable sequel to Super Mario 3D Land.  The biggest problem is that despite the staggering amount of ideas found throughout the game, most of them are only encountered a couple times, or never last long enough to leave much of an impression.  This makes the game feel less of an adventure and more like a series of mini games, which is what Galaxy 2 mostly suffers from.  The clear pipe concept is a new addition to the series, but it's actually overrated because it's never particularly fun for one thing (except for level 6-3 which uses the pipes more than the other stages) and also because it's hardly ever used extensively.  For 90% of the time you encounter clear pipes, they only serve a brief purpose of going to a new area which is basically a similar idea to the launching stars from the Super Mario Galaxy series.  Hopefully people are exaggerating when they say it's innovative- all you do is automatically go through pipes, and rarely collect items or dodge traps and enemies.  It's not very interesting, trust me.  Then again, something other than the standard green pipes is a nice change of direction for Mario I suppose.  I can understand people defending it entirely for this reason.Another problem is that many people assumed with a new Nintendo console we'd have an epic and original Mario adventure on an innovative scale like the Galaxy series, but 3D World falls incredibly short in that regard.  A sequel to a handheld game being advertised a a mega Mario adventure on Nintendo's relatively new Wii U console has to be considered a disappointment.  Not exactly a brilliant way to show off a new gaming system. The good news is that you can play as four different characters each with their own unique moves- Luigi jumps high, Toad moves fast, Princess Peach floats a great distance, and Mario is the most well-rounded character of the bunch.  This feature was first introduced in Super Mario Bros. 2 for the NES and, even though most of the stages in 3D World are easily beatable regardless of the character (which could be considered a flaw as well, since it means these levels weren't designed with each characters strengths and weaknesses in mind) the choices in playable characters is a nice feature.While the cat suit is a unique suit that moves realistically to an actual cat, it's probably the most broken item in the Mario series due to the fact you can not only attack with it, you can also climb walls and skip portions of levels.  It's really fun to mess around with don't get me wrong, but it's also overused like mad since at least half of the stages in the game use it.  The "double cherry" concept where you have more than one Mario, Luigi, Toad or Princess Peach on screen at the same time is somewhat enjoyable, but also distracting and often times confusing as well.  Too much of a good thing.  Also, small complaint, but the flagpole finish has been used way too often by this point, and I'd like to see Nintendo offer more in the way of variety and other options because jumping on a flagpole and being encouraged to reach the top is not only tiresome and overused, but needlessly nostalgic.  Maybe something like matching 3 mushrooms, flowers or stars like in Super Mario Bros. 3 would be a more interesting way to end a level in the next Mario title, or better yet, the flower roulette wheel from Yoshi's Island (a personal favorite of mine).  Or perhaps something else entirely.  Something other than the dang flagpole all the time.The one really bright spot is the music.  I'm someone who can live without most of the music in Mario games but Super Mario 3D World is a major exception.  The variety is astounding, but it's also the type of music never heard before in a Mario game.  Some people argue whether catchy music or more classical compositions are more appropriate for the Mario series but the truth is, what *really* matters is whether the notes are good or not.  In this case, the music is constantly terrific.  It's jazzy but not in an annoying and distracting kind of way like in Galaxy 2, but in a more upbeat and memorable way that fits well with the level themes.  The water levels jazzy music is amazingly good for example.  There's so many excellent theme songs in this game that it's ridiculous.  An *incredible* well-done job there.  Also the green star concept has returned.  You have to collect 3 green stars per stage to open up other levels later on.  It's important to try and make an effort to collect *all* of these so you can see all the levels the game has to offer.Now let me describe each level in specific detail.  I will rank the amount of enjoyment each level provides using a familiar 1-5 scale, and mention how difficult the stage is for me using "easy, medium or hard".  This is going to be fun!  Hope you like reading!  Please note that the rest of this review from here on out can be interpreted as major SPOILERS.  Please keep this in mind.  If you haven't played the game yet and don't want to know what happens, don't read the rest of my review.1-1.  Generic grasslands stage, first appearance of the cat suit, sparse enemy-wise, catch rabbits (2-easy) 1-2.  Underground stage with purple bricks, goombas, green koopas, a cool infinite 1-up secret, same underground music since the original SMB on the NES but of course remixed (2-easy).  Love how the sunlight shines through the cracks.  1-3.  Another grasslands level with piranha plants that recalls Yoshi Star Galaxy from Super Mario Galaxy 2 where you climb higher on generic building blocks, and a cloud world similar to the ones you experience in 3D Land is found here (2-easy).  1-A.  A room where you have to battle charging chucks, a returning enemy from Super Mario World (3-easy).  1-4.  Riding a big dinosaur creature (NOT Yoshi) through rings and across ramps over a river of water.  Too short but fun while it lasts.  It feels like a less adventurous version of the Manta Ray levels from Super Mario Galaxy due to lacking the adrenaline rush of surfing the big waves (4-easy).  1-5.  A carninal/palace type setting that's very colorful.  You have to jump on blue tiles and turn them yellow while climbing through the stage which is a clear Galaxy reference- magikoopas first appear here too (3-easy).  1-Toad.  This is the first of many Toad levels in the game where you're in a tiny cube-shaped geometrical maze building and you have to obtain all the green stars.  You will be constantly rotating the camera around to get a better view, believe me.  In fact you HAVE to rotate the camera.  This one consists of green platforms and it's painfully simplistic (1-easy).  1-Castle.  You basically have to toss soccer ball-like cannon bombs at goombas while jumping across easy platforms and raising building structures.  While Bowser's car chase battle is barely strategic here, it does intensify later on in the game.  Love the jazzy/heavy metal music combination of the two styles during the Bowser fight (4-easy).2-1.  Egyptian/sand themed level with big pecking birds as enemies, quirky-moving platforms that can be quite the intimidating spectacle at first, and a cool bonus stage with falling coins as the Super Mario Bros. 2 character select music plays here.  The violin music is great in the main area of the stage (4-easy).  2-2.  Beautiful nighttime and pink/purple platform setting with ambient piano.  Reminds me of Sweet Mystery Galaxy from Galaxy 2 in both level design and music.  The glowing debris particles provides beautiful eye candy.  Another cloud world as well (3-easy).  2-3.  Underground level surrounded by silver bricks where you can pick up and carry a piranha plant and make it munch/eat other enemies which honestly makes it comparable to using Yoshi.  A fine substitute to Yoshi.  Love the way you can walk behind walls and see nothing but the shadows of yourself and the enemies.  Can you say "crumbling Bowser statue?" (3-easy).  2-4.  The most popular level in the game due to it being the example level we've been seeing for months illustrating the cat suits abilities.  Grassland level with decent design- an improvement over the similar grass-themed levels in World 1.  Monty moles everywhere, and the underground portion's too brief (3-easy).  2-A.  Battle 3 large monty moles (2-easy).  2-B.  Battle a variety of enemies in succession (4-medium).  2-5.  A pink Barbie doll-type level.  Very straight forward with the ability to collect the double cherries that I mention in paragraph 3.  Platforms comparable to skateboard ramps but it's a dull level without the use of the double cherries.  Makes me think it's a deliberately unspectacular level designed just so Nintendo can sell the double cherry concept (2-easy).  2-Castle.  Scrolling diagonal tank level with bullet bills and smashable crates where you have the ability to shoot cannonballs wearing a suit.  Cool concept.  Boom Boom fight identical to 3D Land's except he turns invincible sometimes (3-easy).3-1.  Straight forward snow level with snowman enemies, ability to pick up and toss snowballs at enemies, ride iceskate-shaped snowmobiles, knock out goombas riding in snowmobiles and chase rabbits.  Winter music is heroic and memorable (4-easy).  3-2.  A scrolling grassland level where you have to jump over (or climb with the cat suit) upright-moving gates.  The big band music is somewhat inappropriate for such a stage, but still a pretty good theme.  You encounter donut lifts later on (2-easy).  3-3.  A ghost house.  LOVE the violin classical music.  Floating couches can be found, as well as a cube-shaped rotating green star room that's enough to make you dizzy!  Boos and big boos, library setting in the background- surprised the books don't fly off the shelves!  Love the giant mirror, falling escalator steps and the surprising fake flagpole at the end (4-easy).  3-4.  A short timer level where you have to jump across platforms that resemble a cake with one or more pieces missing while collecting 10-second timer-increasing clocks like in Galaxy 2.  Avoid piranha plants and goombas, find another cloud bonus and search for more catchable rabbits.  It's too short (3-easy).  3-Toad.  Less generic than the Toad cube house in World 1 but still easy (2-easy).  3-A.  Defeat 3 magikoopas (1-easy).  3-5.  Beach level with goombas floating on rafts- more jazz music that's even better than the music found in 3-2.  LOVE how the music changes to aquatic when you're underwater and avoiding spiked puffer fish.  The sunken ship background while flowing through clear pipes is *unbelievably* pretty (4-easy).  3-6.  Fast-paced running/jumping Sonic the Hedgehog or Super Mario Kart-type level with speed boosts and ramps and making sure you cross donut lifts and avoid piranha plants with care (5-medium).  3-7.  More jazzy instrumentation.  Unique level in appearance- Autumn-like setting with brown platforms, shallow water, bee enemies, electrical amp enemies from Super Mario Galaxy 2.  The waterfall portion is effectively atmospheric.  Love how you jump inside the waterfall in one part and move around on those returning left/right green arrow platforms from Super Mario 3D Land.  Avoid the rolling caterpillars!  A nice challenge of a stage (4-medium).  3-Castle.  You have to ride a train avoiding homing bullet bills  (some of them big) and avoid floaty-type enemies.  The battle with the female boomerang-tossing Boom Boom and her clones is easy but the level itself is hard (5-hard).  3-B.  A carnival level where you have to battle a purple snake- this is famous and familiar due to all the previews of the game showing it constantly.  Climb on top of the cymbal-like platforms attached to the heads of smaller snakes that pop out of the ground while avoiding boulders (3-medium).4-1.  A sandy level where you have to climb across platforms avoiding/defeating purple ant-like clingy enemies that can walk around platforms (Metroid Prime 2 influence no doubt).  Later on you have to bounce on top of super-sized ants to avoid dropping into the spikes below (3-easy).  4-2.  A beautiful jungle theme with pink-headed vined piranha plants slithering out of walls, ceilings and floors like snakes.  Strange level, but awesome in appearance.  The green platforms mixed with purple lava (or dark matter) is a sight to behind (3-easy).  4-A.  Simply throw boulders into the lava (2-easy).  4-3.  Similar to Beat Block Galaxy from SMG2 with the disappearing platforms.  You have to avoid boomerang brothers.  The level is bland and derivative except for the long slide at the end which makes the challenge go up a tad (3-easy).  4-4.  Grasslands stage with bounceable platforms and spinys.  Fun but very easy except for the enemy-populated area near the end (2-easy).  4-B.  A series of easy tasks- bouncy grassland platforms, running up a ramp, being chased by big homing bullet bills, avoiding the dropping thwomps, riding across swingable platforms, avoiding rolling spiked logs, etc.  Medium challenge due to so much taking place.  Admittedly it can seem like an overwhelming series of incoherent chores until you get the hang of it (4-medium).  4-5.  Stone structure level where you must avoid rolling spiked logs, climb ramps, turn blue panels yellow, deal with swinging platforms with rolling spiked logs on top of them (VERY tricky part here if you're too slow) (4-medium).  4-Castle.  Disappointingly short level with boulders you can pick up (like in 4-A) and toss them at stacked goombas walking around and very little in the way of threats.  Giant boulder boss is fun but way too easy (2-easy).5-Toad.  Toad ghost house-themed cube level with trippy and awesome music.  Collect the green stars.  I can tell these type of levels are getting more elaborate with each one (3-easy).  5-1.  Beach level with green koopas and charging chucks.  Memorable jazzy beach music like in 3-5.  You can experiment with a wide variety of power-ups including koopa shell, goomba and boomerang brother constumes which are all really fun to use.  The rainbow-colored underground floor panel segment is cool, as is the dinosaur water ride.  The variety is really solid (4-easy).  5-2.  A carnival castle level with upbeat carnival music and a dark cloudy background which makes the level unusual to admire.  You have to swing across colorful panels that basically serve as vines like in Donkey Kong.  The piranha plant merry-go-round is neat to see (2-easy).  5-3.  100 seconds to grab green stars/reach flagpole.  Really short and bland with very little danger (1-easy).  5-A.  A room filled with charging chucks.  Easy and short (2-easy).  5-4.  Grassy level with a beautiful shade of yellow due to a sunset in the background.  Avoid fuzzies between clear pipes and more purple ants.  The second half is better with rotating platforms and a wide open grassy/bushy Zelda-like section chasing rabbits and avoiding a trail of coin-carrying ants (2-easy).  5-5.  Underground bob-omb level with rotating platform rabbit chases, and having to toss bombs at stacked goombas to create explosions and open new areas and secrets.  Simplistic floor panel puzzle (3-easy).  5-6.  Flippable blue/red panels from 3D Land and Galaxy, electrical round currents return from the Galaxy series too.  Really unique platform jumping puzzle can be found here that involves properly rolling a boulder to a location at the bottom in a screen that resembles the original Mario Bros. arcade game from the mid 80's.  Pretty fun level despite being generic and familiar (3-easy).  5-7.  Weird robotic snapping-type square enemies that are pesky but can be picked-up and carried, or used to bounce on top of as a way to reach higher areas.  Homing torpedoes, lava and crumbling bridges are a few of the dangers found within- avoid being detected by Bowser's spotlight as much as you can!  Not technically a castle level but it sure feels like one- the torpedoes definitely boost the challenge but it's fun (5-hard).  5-Castle.  Avoid upright square-shaped spiked platforms that flip forward on the path you're walking on as well as charging chucks which is basically the entire theme of the level.  Eventually the platforms alter the way they move and there's a clever green star that's very tricky to grab later on- very tricky Nintendo!  Clever boss fight too (a giant spiky square-shaped upright-moving platform like the rest of them you see throughout the level, but this one's strategic with a weak spot.  Fast movements and accuracy are requirements to conquer it) (5-hard).6-1.  Finally a level that really takes advantage of the clear pipes!!  Popular preview level too, so I already knew what it was like- dodge fuzzies in pipes, a cloud level where you have to pick up a piranha plant and eat enemies with it as you race towards the end, etc.  Clear pipes are everywhere in this stage and it's pretty cool (3-easy).  6-2.  That eerie violin music from the ghost house in 3-3 returns however the concept here is to walk across a broken ship while absorbing a depressing tone overall.  Bullies from Super Mario 64 return.  Such annoying enemies they are too!  If you're not familiar with bullies, they make you bounce backwards when you bump into them which can be quite the hassle when all you're trying to do is avoid them.  This entire level is like a radically different perspective on the Super Mario World sunken ship stage.  The uniqueness of this stage gives it major points (4-easy).  6-3.  The craziest setting for a Mario game yet- a castle... but not any ordinary/redundant castle.  A Chinese pagoda castle!  With gongs and red sheets hanging across the walls in the background!  It's sort of maze-like where you have to hit switches to open/activate doorways and stairways while unintentionally releasing goombas.  After a while you go outside to the rooftop while hearing crickets chirping in the night background, and you use propeller blocks from Super Mario 3D Land to spin around and collect green coins and stars located in tricky spots while avoiding thwomps.  Eventually you arrive to a place where you have to avoid more rolling spiked logs (this time even trickier than before).  There's even a boomerang brothers suit.  Favorite level in the game (5-medium).  6-4.  Purple dark matter surrounds gated platforms that you have to walk across in addition to more colorful swingable vine-like panels and snake-resembling piranhas coming out of walls- the isometric design of this level makes it easy to miss where you need to go which can result in several unnecessary deaths.  The raft ride is too much fun to end so soon (3-medium).  6-A.  A clever boss fight involving a bully but colored gray and much bigger.  The clear pipe strategy is pretty cool and had me stumped for a little while.6-5.  A snow level with some really bizarre enemies; one a cloud that blows gusts of wind and subsequently blows you off the path and two, some kind of sidestepping brick foe (perhaps a miniature thwomp).  More snowmobile riding fun around the icy ponds avoiding snowmobile-riding goombas.  Beautifully created level.  This is a tricky level for a few reasons, mainly the wind-blowing clouds, slippery snowmobile controlling toughness, accidentally taking damage from slippery goombas on ice, a VERY tricky and short-timed green star area using the snowmobile, and a part where you can easily fall to your death if you don't properly time the rising wind (5-hard).  6-6.  A drab (brownish) setting where you climb the outside of a building using cloud platforms and make your way up higher.  Bullet bills occasionally make it hard since it's sometimes confusing knowing where to go (3-easy).  6-7.  A climbing/scrolling level that's sort of scary because of the approaching black mass (that sort of resembles a swarm of bees) that can instantly be the end of your life if you fall too far behind.  The closing trash-compactor like platforms at the end are quite tricky too.  I like the fluttering winged dry bones (4-medium).  6-B.  A series of snowball (or baseball) tossing tests to acquire a green star- one of them reminds me of basketball trampoline which is a creative idea for a Mario game.  The 2D ball-tossing thwomps room is fun too (4-medium).  6-Castle.  A scrolling stage where you have to toss bob-ombs to explode new areas and avoid fireball-shooting brothers.  Easy Boom Boom fight too (3-easy).  6-C.  A giant stone creature that reminds me of an identical-looking statue creature in the room before entering the snow area of Metroid Prime 3.  You have to avoid his pounding jumps and his round uh, rock bubbles? (2-easy).By the way I LOVE how frightening the world map looks in world 7.  Incredibly dangerous and threatening, as well as deceiving since it makes you believe it's the final world in the game but it's not.  7-1 (Castle).  When you first arrive, up ahead you will see fireball brothers shooting fireballs through clear pipes.  Eventually thwomps, stacked goombas, and generic clear pipes can be found.  It's boring and short (2-easy).  7-2 (Castle).  A top-down view in an underground stage.  Very similar to Galaxy 2's Boo Moon Galaxy.  You have to light blue panels yellow by walking on top of them while avoiding spinys and fireball-spitting piranhas.  Terrible stage (1-easy).  7-3 (Castle).  You have 100 seconds to run forward through rings, speed boosts, clear pipes, spikes... incredibly short but fun (4-easy).  7-4 (Castle).  The light blue matter that surrounds the stage is beautiful and reminds me of the Phazon in the final stage of Metroid Prime 3.  You have to climb across purple rock platforms with arrow-providing directions on top of them showing where you need to jump.  Expect to see flying dry bones, dangerous spiked logs rotating around, and being encouraged to push more bullies off the sides of the cliff (3-medium).  7-A (Castle).  Return of the boulder boss, this time much harder since you have to dodge fireballs that crawl on the ground AND fireballs that shoot in the air (4-hard).  7-B (Castle).  A return of the bully boss from 6-A.  This time he shoots blue fire (2-easy).  7-5 (Castle).  Climbing the inside of a glass building avoiding giant-sized thwomps, flying dry bones and magikoopas while surrounded by lava outside as heavy metal/slow moving music with a hint of Santana's mid 70's jazzy rhythmic period and particularly reminiscent of the song "Dance Sister Dance" serves as the main theme.  I LOVE it!  Anyway, guess what happens when you reach the very top?  You quickly have to run back down again to avoid an approaching cloud of dark matter (4-medium).7-6 (Castle).  Underground water stage with bloopers and purple fish with spiked logs.  A stone structure in the middle presents a dilemma for the player because it's hard to properly swim around the beautiful (but deadly) purple fish.  After this you're above ground temporarily to participate in a little koopa shell action and bounce around eliminating foes until you're underground again dealing with tougher fish due to an even tighter area compared to the fish-infested area in the beginning of the stage.  Love the flying fish near the flagpole finish (4-medium).  7-7 (Castle).  Intense lava-rising/lowering stage and avoiding a persistent type of fireball that shoots out of the lava and leaves a trail of hard-to-avoid fire.  Lots of fire dangers throughout this stage (5-hard).  7-Castle.  Another lava stage but this time with normal shooting lava balls (like the ones from the original NES Super Mario Bros.).  You will encounter boomerang brothers, spinning fireball rods, having to knock flame boulders into walls to open bridges, avoiding more of those upright-flipping square shaped platforms, hammer brothers... basically a VERY chaotic stage.  Love the cool "James Bond meets heavy metal" theme song during the Bowser fight.  The objective is to punch giant flaming boulders at Bowser's car while dodging fireballs and spike traps.  It's pretty hard.  REALLY awesome level overall (5-hard).  7-Toad.  This Toad level is really fun since it's the most challenging one so far- thwomps, conveyor belts, bullet bills... an abundance of obstacles with little room for error... yeah, best one yet (3-medium).The beginning levels of World 7 are sort of disappointing since those particular levels hardly ever match the intimidating fire-drenched presentation of the world map but the good news is that World 8's map has some catchy carnival-like music.8-1 (Bowser).  Expect to see spikes rotating on floors, flying dry bones, fireball brothers, and a cool setting with metal platforms above the sky.  I appreciate the detail of showing realistic raindrops dripping on the camera making it look like it's raining on our TV screen.  Mostly easy (3-easy).  8-2 (Bowser).  Flying fast-paced dinosaur-riding action across several patches of sky sand (yes, sandy skies!) avoiding goombas and wigglers.  Really fun.  Too bad the annoying hayride-like music from Super Mario 64 and again in Super Mario Galaxy 2 for Rolling Coaster Galaxy returns for this stage.  Worst. Music. Ever (5-easy).  8-3 (Bowser).  Platform-dominated level with barrel (cylinder) and Clockwork Ruins Galaxy-type wheel-shaped rotating platforms (from Super Mario Galaxy 2) but significantly toned down in difficulty and confusion in comparison to *that* extremely hard Galaxy (4-easy).  Bowser (Train Level).  A scrolling train level with long-necked birds, bullies, a fish tank (cool idea there) and swinging spiked logs standing in your way.  The female Boom Boom fight is surprisingly easy (2-easy).  8-4 (Bowser).  This level is made up of beautiful purple clouds with very dreamy Sweet Mystery Galaxy-like piano ambience and a similar concept in design- magical light blue portions of platforms that only become visible when you walk on them, giant thwomps, tricky placed rolling spiked logs and bullet bills.  Basically a Super Mario Galaxy ripoff with the floors and music, but it's fun at least (4-medium).  8-5 (Bowser).  In the first half you arrive to an underground water level where the water rises and lowers with huge spiked balls standing in your way.  You will ride a dinosaur in the second half, but unfortunately it's a horribly underused concept this time around- you ride him for what, 10 seconds?  Disappointing level overall. (2-easy).8-6 (Bowser).  Ghost house where you walk around inside a box costume with a ghost-destroying light attached to it.  You ride around on platforms, some of which are broken, and you're encouraged to make ghosts vanish the entire time.  It gets hard on the final platform ride due to so many ghosts appearing at once (2-medium).  Bowser Mystery Room (Level).  A series of 10 rooms with 10 green stars where you have to conquer several wall jumping skills that require fast movements and fancy accurate moves in order to be successful (4-hard).  8-7 (Bowser).  A lava stage where you have to make your way across by riding giant block-shaped platforms that literally flip back and forth across a path approximately every second.  You have to adjust/prepare for each flip accordingly because if not... down to your death you go.  Luckily there's a pattern to this.  Later on they become rectangular shaped.  This is *insanely* hard and requires absolute patience on the part of the player with an extra alert attention span.  Also you have to avoid fireballs that come out of the lava, crawl around on the ground, and leave a trail of fire behind (5-hard).  8-A (Castle).  A repeat of the 6-C boss, this time shiny bronze-colored and much faster.  Same strategy (4-medium).  8-B (Castle).  Repeat of 3-B boss with no noticeable differences (2-medium).  Bowser Final Castle Stage.  This is certainly a disappointment in both the level itself and the Bowser fight.  It begins on a rooftop with fireballs raining down from above (avoid them).  Soon you arrive to the Bowser fight.  It's a slow-moving scrolling climb up the outside of a building while wearing the cat suit making for a superhero-like (Spiderman) comparison.  You have to avoid Bowser whenever he appears on screen.  The second half of the battle is slightly harder in both avoiding Bowser's clones and the remainder of the climb to the top with the occasional twists and turns, but nothing too overwhelming, threatening or challenging.  POW!  So cheap!
You all knew this was coming, buckle in too... it's gonna be a wild ride.Bravely Default, as many of you know, is Square-Enix's latest RPG. I like to think of it as Square holding this game out in front of you going &#34;Hey, look LOOK We can still make RPGs... no no don't look at FFXIII look at this.&#34; This is of course not true, but it's funny in my head. The game is Final Fantasy down to every last drop, the only thing it's missing is Chocobos, Mogs, and the words &#34;Final Fantasy&#34; in it's title. Let's go through the FF Checklist shall we?1. Party of characters that have no business having the power of gods because they are like... 17. Check2. Hair styles that require at least 1 gallon of hair gel a day? Check3. Classes and Spells that only Square uses (Fira, Blizzaga, etc...). Check4. Final Fantasy Items: Hi-Potions, X-Potions, Ethers, Turbo Ethers, Antarctic wind etc... Check5. &#34;Multi-hits&#34; (when you attack it says 4-hit) Check6. &#34;Limit Breaks&#34; of some kind? Check7. Airships? Duh! Check8. Final Fantasy jobs? Let's see... Black Mage, White mage, Red mage, Monk, Ranger, Summoner... CHECK8. Four Elemental Crystals that serve as the centerpiece for the world making it run in harmony until one day something shadowy and/or evil happens to them that requires a party of unlikely heroes to band together and make the crystals shiny again... CHEEEEEEEEEECK.Ok now that we've established that this is Final Fantasy V-2 (May as well be). ON WITH THE REVIEW.I'm going to say this right out of the gate. If you have any desire and I mean ANY slight liking of turn based JRPGs, and you have a 3DS. Get this game. Now. If you don't have a 3DS, go buy one and get this game. The amount of things in this game is astonishing and it's just a blast to play, while at the same time it feels like a mixture of modern and older mechanics... weighted more to the older side. I'm going to section out this review so if you are interested in the story or combat you can skip to those sections. Not what I USUALLY do but I'm feeling different today. I have not finished the game but I am at the end of chapter 2. That may not seem like far but that's like... 20 hours already. I've had enough time to get a grasp on the games existence!StoryI can't rate a story until I've finished it, and even then it's not really a ratable thing. However, I can say that it's at least so far interesting. The following is not a spoiler, unless you count what you learn in the first like... 20 minutes a spoiler. The world is held together by 4 Elemental Crystals, Water, Fire, Wind, and earth. Each crystal has a vestal that keep the crystal all shiny and happy through prayer (It's the games religion. Crystalites or something I believe it was called). One of your 4 party members is the Vestal of wind, Agn&egrave;s (pronounced on-yes... not kidding). In the opening video we see bad things happening, some sort of shadow has taken over the crystals. Gee... haven't heard THAT one before... Meanwhile Tiz's entire village is reduced to a giant hole. The goal, as far as I can tell, is to go around the world and restore the 4 crystals. *Ahem* Totally not FF1 or FFV.While you are on this task, another major power called the Bloodrose Legion (I believe) is trying to stop you, since they are anti-crystals and think that the world should be better off without them, yet the second the crystals stopped working the world... more or less died so I'm not sure what logic they are using. Either way the story does what it needs to do, it provides a way to get from Point A to Point B and it actually does something I approve of, it doesn't get in the bloody way. Not once since this started has there been a GIANT gap of story, and by that I mean you finish a task and you spend the next 2 hours listening to people talking about this and that. The talking scenes are quick, they get to the point for the most part, and don't get boring. Just goes to show Square can still tell a story without it being 8 feature length films. With some gameplay in between.CharactersAgain, can't really rate this one. The four main characters all have a distinct personality.Tiz, the cliche hero... I mean Shy Farmer, witnessed a terrible cliche... I mean his village being destroyed, and joined up with the Vestal of wind in the hopes of restoring his village. He is a quite type that is willing to protect his friends yadda yadda yadda. Walking. Talking. Cliche.Agn&egrave;s, or as I like to say dear god please stop talking now my EARS ARE BLEEDING (more on that later). She is the Vestal of Wind and has been tasked with fixing the worlds problems, despite everyone hating her in nearly every town I seem to go to. Then they like her once Agn&egrave;s and the gang fixes something. Silly non-believers. She is innocent, having spent her entire life away from the common-folk and doesn't know a darn thing about what goes on in the world.Ringabel, the games other male character. He has, and stop me if you have heard this one before, Amnesia! he can't remember anything, but he does have a journal that seems to be detail everything that happens before it happens and serves as a plot device constantly. He is also a self-proclaimed ladies man and hits on pretty much every female in the area around him. He has some great lines though even if most of the time you want to kick him in the back of the head.Edea, Actually I saved the best for last as she is by far my favorite character in this game. She betrayed the army she was with to protect Agn&egrave;s and has probably got some of the best bits of dialog in the game, particularly when talking to Ringabel who has fallen in love with Edea.So there you have it, 2 walking Cliches and 2 characters that have a bit of spirit to them. They work well and have a nice synergy about them. I enjoy their interactions from Agn&egrave;s's cluelessness to Ringabels... idiocy and Eda calling Ringabel out on it.By far my favorite line in the game thus far has been:Ringabel: &#34;I know, I've been beating my head against the wall trying to figure it out.&#34;Edea: &#34;Oh? Perhaps you aren't hitting the wall hard enough, here let me assist you&#34;Dunno why, but it makes me laugh!Voice Acting - 2/10OK... so I've described the main characters and they are fine and all but I'm going to touch on what I believe to be the most painful part of this game... it's voice acting. I don't say this lightly, but it is among the worst voice acting I have ever heard in a video game to date. There are worse examples in other games (Maro maro from Blue Dragon for example) but, on the whole this entire game's VAing is bad. I even rate Star Ocean 4's voice acting above this and THAT is saying something.Agn&egrave;s has got by far the worst voice, it's grating, annoying, breaks constantly and just is all around unpleasant. Couple that with the fact that the sound quality of the game is so compressed it's just sad and you have an unpleasent experience. Ringabel and Edea actually have decent voices at least, they have emotion, and sound higher quality for some reason. Those Actors were trying. Some of the enemies also have decent voices, while others have ungodly terrible voices. I switched it to Japanese to see the difference and it just created a different world of issues, some voices got better while others got worse but at the same time the quality was still bad so I switched it back to English.I almost want to recommend playing the game with the voices off (you can mute them specifically) but at the same time I feel that would take a bit away from the game, because at least Ringabel and Edea have fun things to say and they say it well, so... worth it. If I could mute Agn&egrave;s I would. Without question. I know they had to compress it because of the 3DS but... come on... you may as well not recorded half of it and saves some space there.Customization 10/10 - This is split into 2 seperate systemsJobsThrowing back to the FFV days, Square decided to reintroduce the Job system... and I could NOT be happier with this. The game calls it the Asterisk system but... I find that ridiculous so I'm going to call it the job system since they are actually called Jobs in the game anyway... I think they are just confused.The game has something like 23 or 24 different jobs that each character can be. As you defeat enemies you get both EXP and JP (Job Points). Jobs have levels and you advance them by gaining these job points. Each level will unlock either a new job skill or a new job ability. For Example a black mage unlocks tiers of magic as their skills. Level 1, 2, 3 etc... black magic. But that's not all they get, they also obtain abilities like Immunity to silence, Reduced damage from Lightning, etc... these abilities and skills can then be used for other jobs. So if I switch the Black mage to a white mage, I can set their secondary skills to be black magic. Now I can cast both White and Black magic as my White mage. The abilities are also interchangeable, by the end of the game you get 5 ability slots, each ability takes X number of slots (from 1 - 3 I believe) and each does something different. For instance monks gain +10% HP for 1 point, +20% Hp for 2 points and +30% HP for 3 points, combine that with the knights  + 20% physical Defense and you can make an impressive tank character. Or combine 2 Handed (Wield a weapon with 2 hands for double attack power) and +20% Physical Attack on a spell fencer for some massive elemental Damage.The combinations are vast and for me have been really fun to mix and match. I'm up against a boss right now that I can't beat just yet because of one attack it uses that deals massive water damage, so I'm working on unlocking abate water (50% reduced damage from water sources) so I can withstand that assault. The jobs, leveling them, unlocking skills and abilities keeps me interested far more than I thought in this game, and the only wish I had was that I had more characters in my group to try more combinations!You actually don't unlock the jobs through the main story line either, at least not all of them. So far apart from the first few I got as part of the tutorial, all of my jobs have been unlocked through side quests... and these aren't simple tiny side quests they are actual quests. There is trouble in town and you have to figure out what it is! I won't spoil the story but the first 2 side quests I took unlocked 4 more jobs for me to use. So getting all the jobs in the game is going to be fun. At this time I have 11 unlocked I believe. Ranger being my favorite, because it does MASSIVE damage and knows the weakpoints of most of my enemies... and I can use those skills on my other jobs so imagine having all those 1.5x damage skill, then switching to a spell fencer, enchanting your sword with fire and the 2 handed ability, then attacking a plant monster who is weak to fire with the ability that deals 50% more damage to plants... ooooh it's going to be a dead plant!SpecialsSo this game has something similar to limit breaks from FFVII, they are called Specials. You unlock them as the game progresses (more on this later) but you start with a couple in the beginning. Each weapon type has a few specials attached to it and various ways with which to trigger it. The Rod for example requires you to deal damage with magic spells 10 times, and it's special is a single target laser beam that deals heavy damage to 1 opponent... but that's not all. Each special has a secondary buff that is granted to your party for a few turns. So the rod's special also grants +20% additional Magic Damage for a few turns to the whole party. For another example, the Bow requires you to deal weak point damage to enemies 10 times (Rangers are good at that). The attack does massive damage to 1 enemy and raises your parties crit rate by 400% for a few turns... while also looking awesome. There are also support specials like Rejuvenation that heals the party etc... or buff the party and keep everyone protected.Now you may ask why this is under the customization section, well that's because the specials are customizable! As you progress through rebuilding the village (More later on this) you unlock abilities that you can equip to your specials. For instance you can make your special Water based, or Fire based, make it do more damage to plants or Dragons, have a higher crit rate etc... This can be a good and bad thing because it does require a bit of planning. I went into a boss fight with a special that actually healed the boss because it was water based and I forgot to switch it for lightning. But I think it's still awesome how we can change them, make them a little more ours... and not just with abilities. You can rename them! I renamed everything to try and include badger in the title. So Hack and Slash became Badger Strike. Rejuvenation became Badger's Light etc...You can also customize what your characters say when they use the specials. Slightly limited to like... 15 characters but still it's a nice touch. I know it's a nitpick but I would like to have my character say the line while attacking not afterwards. So As I'm shooting my arrow I want him to scream &#34;EULALIA!&#34; (as i have told him to do). not AFTER I have shot it.Combat - 8/10Now being me, I am rather biased against Turn based combat systems, They are either boring, or just insanely brutal against you to the point of tears (Hello Persona...) however I'm going to pick that bias up and throw it out the window for this because it deserves my full unbiased viewing.The combat is great, it's fun and more complicated than simply pressing a single button untill things die. This game isn't a sit back and watch the program type of combat. You have to think. Admittedly part of winning is the setup before combat which I think is a good thing. Think a bit before you go into a fight and your fight should be much faster. bravely Default However, adds a twist. The Brave/Default system really spices things up in my opinion. The system is simple, yet complicated. In combat you have three choices, Attack, Brave, or Default. Attack meaning you take your turn, attack or use a skill/spell expending 1 BP (or more if a skill requires it) and that's about it. As long as you don't have negative BP you can act, you regenerate 1 BP a turn normally up to maximum of 3. Default allows you to defend, taking less damage and not acting this turn, in effect restoring 1 BP. Now these two options are fairly normal... then we get to the third option, and it's one I think makes the game stand out above others. The Brave Option.The Brave option allows you to act more than once when it's your turn. You can use it up to 3 times in 1 turn (Using 4 BP to do so). This allows you to use 4 attacks in 1 go, however it can leave you with a massive amount of Negative BP, which means you can't attack or defend until you don't have negative BP.The system may seem risky and it is, but it has purposes which Are brought forth by the job system. For instance one of the first skills you get as a monk is Invigorate, which increases your attack power by 25% for 2 turns (It has a chance to fail but lets for the sake of argument say it didn't!). Now in most instances you could only get 2 attacks off with that bonus attack, but if you use Brave to get 4 attacks in 1 turn off, you get to hit for 25% power 3 more times than usual. Of course after which you are usually exposed for a turn or 2, but who cares! Another good example is that say you just hit by a massive painful attack, 2 of your characters have died, and your white mage needs to get them up. Well use all 4 braves and you can cast raise twice, then cura twice. And if your like me your white mage was Defaulting for a few turns so he won't be left defenseless after a turn like that. It's just a lot of fun.Now, there are more risks than Just the obvious You can't act for a bit. The enemy can do this as well, they can use Brave and Default. More than once I've fought a boss that used Default the exact turn I decided to throw everything I had at him, and I ended up losing because He withstood my assault and destroyed my soul. It also makes the game a little less easy to predict, and adds a bit of fun to it. You never really know what the enemy is going to do! They are also limited by BP so don't expect them to attack 9 times or something. You can at all times see what the bosses BP is so you can guess on if you are about to be slammed by death or not.Now it's not perfect, and I didn't know where to take points off in this section or another but I chose this one. It being a JRPG does mean there is some grinding involved. And everyone who has played this type knows what I mean. You run around in circles on the map waiting for random encounters, you find a strategy that kills them in one turn and you keep doing that over and over and over again, Sometimes that Strat is a bit harder to find but once found it works endlessly. So I am not a big fan of that part, I can handle it, and it is still fun getting to that next job level. The game does progression amazingly well, you really do feel like you are gaining power with each level increase.The other point I take off is because of the fact that sometimes I feel like the AI is cheating. This may be me being paranoid, but rarely does the computer default until RIGHT after I decide to use everything I have at once, it's almost like clockwork. I think it waits and then acts after I've made a decision. It's annoying! but... alas it's probably my faut for trying to do everything in one turn. One other thing I will say is that the bosses are rough. Really rough. They require planning and have some incredibly cheap and devastating attacks.Network Features and Mini Things - 7/10Here we get into some of the slight issues I have with the game. This being the year 2013 (I know it's 2014 but the game was release originally in 2013!) We have decided that everything has to involve friends and friends lists and the internet and stuff. A theory that I sadly don't prescribe to. However, I can't fault it for trying either. There are just some key issues I think don't work that well and they inhibit the game somewhat. First I'll explain what it involves though.You can Summon friends to help you in combat, as well as be summoned by others. Now I don't mean a co-op or anything it's still a single player game. What I do mean is that if you have an internet connection you can register an attack or a heal and send it to your buddies to use as an attack in their game. For example I cast Rejuvenate on my entire Party and send it to the internet. Anyone on my friend's list can now summon my character and cast rejuvenate on their party (only once though). The more friends you have on your friends list the more options you can have to summon etc... Now there is an inherent issue with this. This being a Nintendo game, it's STILL annoying as hell to register people onto your friends list. You have to exchange codes and all that fun crap still, and without a forum or a central place where you are giving people codes you will not get them. You also have to have a wireless internet connection which yes at this point is fairly common but not everyone has it. The good thing is, Summoning and sending doesn't really add much to the game other than a bit of fun. The other feature however is more reliant on it.There is a mini-game in this game, and it's the restoration effort for Tiz's village. You can restore Shops, Get new specials, get special modifiers as well as weapons and armor you can't buy elsewhere in the game. This is a time consuming game that thankfully performs all it's tasks in the background or while your 3DS is in sleep mode. As I write this review, my villagers are at home building my shops up, and each one will take about 6 hours to do so. I left some major projects going while I went to work. Now you start the game with 1 villager, and he can build up things slowly. If you connect to the internet 1 time a day you slowly gain more and more villagers, this really helps in the restoration effort. But it also highlights the biggest problem I have. What if you don't have that option. If you can't connect to the internet, or you can't find anyone with spot pass... you are stuck with 1 villager and the amount of time it would take for him to do everything is months. And in that line, you would miss out on a lot of specials and cool items. It is easily remedied by going to a free Wi-Fi place which... heck I think even McDonald's has free wi-fi now, but still it's a tad off.Then there is the one thing I think wasn't needed in this game, it actually has a Micro transaction shop in it. What can you buy? Gear? Armor? Items? Noooo... you can buy Turns to use in combat. That's right.. you can Buy the ability to use an additional turn. I don't know the cost, because the first one is discounted at 50 cents and I didn't buy it. The other way to gain additional SP (That's the currency for extra turns) is to put the 3DS into sleep mode for 8 hours with the game running it's tasks. You can have up to 3 and can use them in combat whenever you want by pressing the start button. Honestly though. I don't really see the need for buying them. I can't say it's like the devil that it's in the game, but I have to question why it's there in the first place. It seems... just... odd to me.Which also brings up my final thought on the mini-game... you do have to keep your 3DS in sleep mode CONSTANTLY. Right now mine is plugged into the wall at home, and It's going to be on for a very very long time considering how much of the village I have to restore. I mean 5 villagers working on clearing one step of the village will take 20 hours. (99 alone!). But it is always a joy to come home or wake up after letting them work for 8 hours and getting all those rewards. No you can't pay to get them to work faster!You also have the ability to customize a few bits of difficulty in the game. Allowing you to change the frequency of encounters from 0 (none) to +100% (A lot more). This allows for better grinding, or getting back to town if you really didn't wanna fight things 20 levels lower than you! You can also enable or disable JP, EXP, Autosave, and change the difficulty from Normal to Hard or Easy. Hard mode... In my opinion is just frustrating and gives no reward for you actually playing in hard mode. At least none that I saw. It makes every fight brutal and basic enemies can one shot you, I didn't honestly enjoy it all that much, so I switched back to normal. And even then bosses destroy me. Seriously though I could not play this game without Autosave, I forget to save too often and would be annoyed with losing time!All in all, I give the game 9 Bitter Badgers out of 10. It's fantastic, and I can't seem to stop playing the damn thing. If you liked Final Fantasy Anything before XII, you will probably love this game. It has customization, craziness, and joy around every corner. The combat is fun yet challenging, the bosses may be a bit brutal, bit nothing a little grinding or better planning won't fix!TLDR Version: 9/10.Pros+Good risk vs. Reward combat+Decent Characters with lots of cliches thrown in+Nearly unparalleled amount of Customization for the type of game it is. From jobs to abilities to your special attacks.+Decent Story, doesn't hold the game up and has some fun dialog+Challenging if you want it to be.+Fairly easy if you want it to be, there is even an auto battle feature+It's final Fantasy V-2. No other way to put it!Cons-Voice acting is atrocious-Sometimes the AI can feel cheap-The internet features can be limiting if youo don't have the option to connect to them.-Did I mention the voice acting is BAD?-If you went digital it takes up basically an entire 4gb SD card.-Gotta leave your 3DS in sleep mode for the village to be rebuilt in any logical amoutn of time even with a good amount of villagers.
For those who may be too young to remember or perhaps missed out on the NES and SNES generation and had to begin their side scrolling Mario days with New Super Mario Brothers, there used to be a time when Mario games were extremely big, extremely challenging and filled to the brim with secrets.  That's not to say New Super Mario Bros. is bad.  They are most certainly not.  It's only to suggest that New Super Mario Bros. doesn't feel like it reaches quite as high creatively as Mario did back in his glory days of the 80's and early 90's.  The original Mario trilogy on the NES was a treat in and of itself.  So when the Super Nintendo launched in 1991 it was no shock a Super Mario game would launch with it.  And yet, it is still widely considered one of the best Mario games of all time.  Of all of Mario's 2D side-scrolling adventures, Super Mario World is my personal favorite.  No game has challenged me or made me thrilled to play games quite like this little gem.  We've come a long way in gaming, but it's place in history will never change.The plot in Super Mario World is (what else) Princess Peach has been kidnapped by that dastardly Bowser and it's up to Mario and his brother Luigi to save the day again.  This time they'll travel through Dinosaur Island on a quest to the Valley of Bowser to stop the Koopa King.  Along the way they'll also encounter Yoshi who is going after Bowser to save some of the dinosaur eggs.  Mario has never been much for plot and story, and in the year 1991 you probably didn't find too many story driven games as it is.  Mario has always been about pushing gameplay.Super Mario World more than pushes gameplay.  As the original Super Mario Bros. did on the Nintendo, Super Mario World redefined gaming for a whole generation.  Like Super Mario Brothers 3 there was an overworld map.  Each time you go into a level you'll end up playing through in typical fashion.  Usually moving from left to right in an attempt to find the goal at the end of the level.  The actual levels themselves are very well designed.  There's a lot of variety.  You'll rarely feel like you're playing through the same level twice as each one is unique in its own way.  At the end of each level is a tape that you must cut that you'll get bonus points from.  For every 100 bonus points there is also a bonus game for a chance to earn extra lives.Unlike Super Mario Bros. 3, however, every level can be revisited.  And Super Mario World wants you to spend time going back to some of them.  There are a few that have alternate exits that may take you to hidden levels or reveal other locations.  For instance some hidden exits might take you to a Switch Palace where you'll hit a switch that makes other blocks appear in certain levels to make your platforming easier.  Some just lead to other levels.  But the most rewarding are the ones that lead to the Star Road.  You can think of these as "Warp Zones," but mostly it's just a hidden world that has its own goodies.  The Star World also connects to a special world that's filled with tons of challenges.  There are 96 different exits in Super Mario World.  And if you want to discover all the game has to offer then you'll need to find them all, connect the entire Star World and go through the "Special World" challenges to uncover all of the secrets Super Mario World has.In Super Mario Bros. 3 you had the suit system.  A system I still feel was the best thing Mario ever did.  You don't quite get that here.  You have standard power ups like the Mushroom and the Flower but you also get a feather which allows you to fly with a cape.  Super Mario World's biggest addition, however, is Yoshi.  A dinosaur you can get on the saddle of.  He can eat enemies, allow Mario to walk on otherwise dangerous terrain and eat certain Koopa shells that can give him powers.  There's the yellow, which allow for ground stomps.  Red allows him to breathe fire and blue lets him fly.  For those who manage to find the Star Road they'll find special colored Yoshis each who have their own unique abilities regardless of which shell they eat.  Red Yoshis always breathe fire when they ingest a shell.  Blue will always fly and yellow will always have a ground stomp.  It's a lot of fun stuff to explore.  Yoshi is a valuable ally, but he can be lost at any time when you take a hit while riding him.  He'll run off and it's your job to hop back on him.  He also won't follow you into ghost houses or castles, but at least he stays with you throughout each new level.There has been a lot of talk about the difficulty level of New Super Mario Bros. and I have to disagree when compared to Super Mario World.  I mean, certainly Super Mario World is no challenge for me now, but then again I've been playing it for over twenty years now.  I know the game inside and out.  But as a kid it was a very difficult experience.  I saw many game over screens.  And when you saved, the game didn't save your lives and power ups for you.  It just saved where you were (and you had to beat a ghost house, castle or switch palace in order to do it).  I recall many lava pits, many instances of one-hit kills (Castle 6 had those spike pillars that always killed you in one hit).  It was such a difficult game that when it was released on the Gameboy Advance in 2002 they made it easier.  See, in Mario now when you get hit while having a power up, you revert back to Super Mario (as though you just grabbed a mushroom) first before reverting back to small Mario.  Super Mario World didn't do that.  If you had a feather you didn't revert back to normal big Mario.  You immediately went back to being small Mario.  It seems silly but this tiny thing actually made Super Mario World a challenge.  In some of the castles in particular, this was trouble.  You always had a back up power up, at least.  That is to say, an item that was in a blue box at the top of the screen that always dropped down when you got hit (or you could use by pressing select).  Grab this item and things were okay, but it was a risk to get it if there were enemies around.Basically what I'm saying is that after being tortured by some of Super Mario World's challenges as a kid I found New Super Mario Bros. Wii (the one everyone says is so hard) to be a cakewalk by comparison.  The only thing that made it hard were the people I played with who were either too slow to keep up or who insisted that throwing me in lava would be more amusing than actually finishing the level.  Don't get me wrong, I love me some New Super Mario Bros., but I imagine that those who never played Super Mario World would probably find it more difficult if they never played it before.Obviously Super Mario World is hindered by Super Nintendo limitations.  It's not a real flashy game.  Although Mario never really got by on flash and powerful graphics.  It usually got by on its art design.  Super Mario Galaxy isn't a powerful game, but it's still beautiful because of the art design of the game in and of itself.  Super Mario World is pretty similar.  It looks good because the art style is pretty good.  So 22 years later, Super Mario World is most certainly not an eyesore.  It's not powerful (even by Super Nintendo standards when games like Donkey Kong Country and Super Mario RPG would really push the limits of the console) but it's still pretty because of its own artistic charm.  The backgrounds are playful and inviting while the levels are incredibly well designed.  The music is also incredibly catchy.Perhaps the only thing disappointing about Super Mario World is that the boss fights were never all that particularly exciting.  The exception being the final battle with Bowser, which is still memorable to me in a lot of ways.  But for the most part, the Koopa kids just weren't that much fun to really mess around with.  Especially because at some point it recycles each boss battle with a unique twist.  In one battle for instance, Martin Koopa walks up the wall, onto the ceiling and tries to crush you.  Later on when you battle Roy it's the same boss fight, but this time after each hit the walls close in.  It's still the same boring battle.  This is especially a letdown considering the levels to actually get to them.  After such a challenging Castle that Wendy's castle is, it's disappointing that the boss fight is just a repeat of a battle you already encountered in Castle 3.All that being said, I enjoyed Super Mario World immensely.  It's still my favorite side-scrolling adventures (though Super Mario Bros. 3 simply can't be ignored).  It's by far the biggest of Mario's side scrolling adventures because of how much there is to do.  You can see shades of it in New Super Mario Brothers (particularly the alternate exits).  For those who have yet to play and experience Super Mario World, you really should.  It's an amazing game that shouldn't be missed.
In 1994, Rare developed a little game called Donkey Kong Country that became a huge smash on the Super Nintendo. It went on to sell millions of copies and was even followed up by two sequels. After the Donkey Kong Country trilogy came we were subjected to Donkey Kong 64 and then numerous strange games that seemed to feature Donkey Kong, but not exactly play like Donkey Kong. Thus, when Donkey Kong Country Returns first came out, it was easy to be excited. Because it was the first time in a over a decade that we got the chance to play a traditional Donkey Kong Country game and the results are fantastic.  When it was released on the Wii in 2010 it was hailed as an instant classic.  Now the game is getting a 3DS port and it's still pretty good.The original game followed the tale of Donkey Kong. His bananas were taken by King K. Rool and Donkey Kong had to go out, along with Diddy Kong, to get them back. Donkey Kong Country Returns goes back to that. But instead of King K. Rool and Kremlings it's a bunch of Tiki's that have done this. It's actually very hard NOT to miss the Kremlings. Especially in a Donkey Kong game that's supposed to be a return to things. But you won't mind too much because the level designs and the challenge this game evokes is absolutely fantastic.You'll go by on a world map from one level to the next completing them in an effort to get back your bananas from those Tiki's. They all start off rather easy at first, teaching you basic things and hoping you can keep up with all you've been taught. The first two worlds in particular are cake walks but once you get to world 3 things really pick up and start to become challenging. The gameplay is extremely familiar to anyone who played the original Donkey Kong Country games from a long time ago. You'll run and jump on your enemies, and you'll find hidden barrels and passages that'll take you to bonus rooms where you can reap the rewards. Every level also has puzzle pieces that you'll want to collect.There are a few things that have changed, however. The first is how your partner works. In the original games you could switch between Donkey and Diddy. And when one took a hit, he immediately ran away and the partner picked up the slack. After that one more hit meant the loss of a life. Here, both Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong have hearts. And Diddy will always be on Donkey Kong's back. Always. You won't be able to switch to him at all. But he will allow you to hover for a short period of time. Once you lose your first two hearts you lose Diddy and your ability to hover briefly. Until you find a DK barrel and get him back. Donkey Kong also has two hearts, and once lost the level ends. The level design here has made Donkey Kong Country Returns quite difficult, but fun and manageable. You'll find some moments of trial and error. But they're some well crafted levels that never throw the same thing at you twice. Even familiar levels will always have new tweaks. The first mine car level is basic. But there's one down the line that has you having to stay inside a giant while until it crumbles away. It is AMAZING stuff. The boss battles are also amazing and require a lot of pattern recognition. There's a lot of variety to each level. Couple that with the fact that some levels have you going into the background and foreground and there's a lot to do and explore in just about every level (not to mention this aspect looks pretty good in 3D). The game provides a challenge, but like so many of Nintendo's games that do in this day and age, it makes sure that extra lives are scattered everywhere. Just in case. Even if you ARE having problems, you're still not likely to see a game over screen any time soon based on the abundance lives.There are other moments that breathe of Donkey Kong Country. A lot of the music you here is simply remixed from the original Donkey Kong Country and it sounds brilliant and sometimes even sets the atmosphere. It's likely to fill long time fans with nostalgia.That's not to say it's all nostalgic though. There are some things that were either left on the cutting room floor. For instance, there are no real animal buddies here and that's a shame. You won't find some of your favorites like Rambi the Rhino or anything like that. For the most part Donkey Kong Country Returns doesn't really feature them. The other thing is that a lot of the Kong family isn't really there either. Part of the fun and charm of some of the other games was running into some of the ohter Kong's such as Wrinkly or Funky or Cranky. And while Cranky Kong returns, it's not with some of his clever fourth wall breaking "we know we're in a video game," banter that he used to always have that made him such a comical character in the Super Nintendo classics.The Wii version of Donkey Kong Country Returns didn't have the best control scheme.  Thanks to making you waggle the Wii Remote to perform certain actions (like rolling) it was a little too sensitive and sometimes caused the player to perform actions they didn't want to.  Here, everything is mapped to a button.  And in a game this challenging you'll definitely appreciate it.Donkey Kong Country Returns also has a multiplayer function similar to New Super Mario Bros. Wii. One player controls Donkey Kong and the other controls Diddy Kong. It's the only time you really can control Diddy manually. You'll have to work together, but unlike New Super Mario Bros. Wii, there isn't much fun in messing around with your friends. The focus here is strictly teamwork and it holds to that. The game is a challenge and the last thing you'd want to do is mess up your partner who could potentially be carrying you through a level anyway.Apparently many a gamer must've thought the Wii version was too much of a challenge.  Indeed, there is an option here to make the game easier for players just jumping in.  True enough, Donkey Kong Country Returns actually is quite the challenge.  It takes a lot to really master a certain level.  You can make the game easier, and it'll give you some additional hearts as well as some new items available to you.  Make no mistake, Donkey Kong Country Returns lives up to its reputation of being a challenging game, but it's a good challenge.  If you do mess up too many times, however, the game will play through the level for you (although it will not grab any bonuses throughout).The other big question is always whether or not there's something new when a port comes around.  Donkey Kong Country Returns has a whole new world you can through on the the 3D release.  It's just barely enough of a curiosity to Wii Owners to make it worth trying, but it might not be enough to make it worth picking up just yet.  Aside from that the game is primarily the same.  The only real problem with 3DS port is that the game doesn't seem like it was made to be experienced on the small screen.  Sometimes it's hard to see just what hit you in some instance.  Eventually you'll get the gist, but you might suffer unnecessarily as a result.Visually Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D is a very pretty game.  Mostly the environments and the backgrounds.  The ability to go into the background or (sometimes) foreground is certainly not bad either.  The 3D is actually good for moments like these.  On the other hand, there's nothing the 3D will add to the gameplay.  You could just as easily do well with it off.  Despite that the game looks good in 3D there's nothing about it that will wholly immerse you in the experience.  Like many 3DS games you'll probably turn the 3D off after a while.There's always a wonder about whether or not to get the older version or the new.  The new world is certainly a curious thing and Wii Owners may like the idea of a more classic control scheme, but I'm finding it hard to say you'd need this version if you've already played the Wii version.  There are new levels but there aren't exactly a lot of new levels.  There isn't much you'll experience here that you didn't experience before.  On the other hand, if you've never played Donkey Kong Country Returns and you're curious, it's probably better to go with the 3DS variant.  The choice is yours.If you were a fan of the original Donkey Kong Country games then by all means play Donkey Kong Country Returns. If you never played them before and you just want to jump in, there's nothing to stop you this time around. It's a fun game, just one that can be pretty difficult. But that's not such a bad thing.

Excelente juego. Es muy diferente a cualquier juego de v&iacute;deo. Obliga a pensar y a moverse, dos cosas que en los v&iacute;deo juegos son muy escasas. los gr&aacute;ficos son simples, pero no se necesita mas. la m&uacute;sica es muy adictiva y divertida. Claro esta que uno no aguanta jugar por horas este juego, pero si lo anima a jugar un poco todos los d&iacute;as para seguir avanzando y eso es muy bueno con los ni&ntilde;os que normalmente se quedan pegados a un juego por horas.

Este no es el juego tradicional de mover el control. Este es el juego de mover el cerebro y luego mover el control. Muy sencillo, muy divertido y permite jugar en familia. Tiene muchas opciones y es muy divertido. Mis hijos y yo lo jugamos juntos todo el tiempo y me gusta por que no me aburre y no los aburre a ellos.
