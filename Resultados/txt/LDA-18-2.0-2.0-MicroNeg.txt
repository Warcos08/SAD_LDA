There is a big flaw in these black controllers.  I have two black ones and two white ones.  Both black ones do not hold my rechargeable batteries properly.  A little push or bump on the battery pack will cause the controller to turn off.  This does not happen ever with the two white ones.  Other than that, what else is there to say.  They are the best design controllers for any gaming counsel ever.
I loved MK, and wanted to love this, but sadly I was disappointed....sorry fans, but I must pass on Tao Feng.it's sad since SO MUCH work went into this title....hope the next one goes better....

good product but upon turning it on some LED lights were missing and i opened the controller to check and only one LED light was on the circuit board
Want a boring experience with clumsy play control? Then pick this poor excuse for a killer app up. You will appreciate Mario and Sonic more, but that still won't get you your money back.

I never purchase 3rd party controllers, I always buy only official products but I may change that after this experience. I ordered this controller and from the first minute I started using it BOTH analog sticks contantly pan to the right making playing any FPS a headache. I requested a replacement from Amazon only to receive a Chinese knock-off controller, as soon as I started using this one the right analog stick pans up nonn-stop, it was impossible to make it stop moving. Two controllers in a row and BOTH immediately have problems? Will never buy official controllers again.
Boring!  This game has nothing to rave over and alot to dispise.  Rent it before buying, or you will be disappointed in losing 50 bucks.

There is a big flaw in these black controllers.  I have two black ones and two white ones.  Both black ones do not hold my rechargeable batteries properly.  A little push or bump on the battery pack will cause the controller to turn off.  This does not happen ever with the two white ones.  Other than that, what else is there to say.  They are the best design controllers for any gaming counsel ever.
I loved MK, and wanted to love this, but sadly I was disappointed....sorry fans, but I must pass on Tao Feng.it's sad since SO MUCH work went into this title....hope the next one goes better....

good product but upon turning it on some LED lights were missing and i opened the controller to check and only one LED light was on the circuit board
Want a boring experience with clumsy play control? Then pick this poor excuse for a killer app up. You will appreciate Mario and Sonic more, but that still won't get you your money back.

I never purchase 3rd party controllers, I always buy only official products but I may change that after this experience. I ordered this controller and from the first minute I started using it BOTH analog sticks contantly pan to the right making playing any FPS a headache. I requested a replacement from Amazon only to receive a Chinese knock-off controller, as soon as I started using this one the right analog stick pans up nonn-stop, it was impossible to make it stop moving. Two controllers in a row and BOTH immediately have problems? Will never buy official controllers again.

Since its not fair to give a review on hype and promises alone, I'm going to give you the review first and then list the promises that were made which is why I gave fable such a low rating.Sound: The game has wonderful sound to it with the npc voices and even the fighting music and traveling a music. Its not the greatest but it did deliver when and where it was needed.Graphics: I am not one to base rpg's on graphics, I can do well with sprites and old school NES and SNES graphics. To me graphics are not what make an rpg an rpg, its all about the story and character development. Graphics are eyecandy when making an rpg. With that said, this game delivers in all areas, your character is wonderfully done (I don't know technical terms with graphics so bare with me), the towns and npc's are amazing and beautiful, the magic and weapon designs are amazing and an treat for the eye. Unfortunately, with the trees and grass and the world looking amazing, you can't run off the beaten path and enjoy it.Story: I don't give spoilers away and I won't here. I'm sorry to say that the story is lacking in all departments and when it finally starts picking up its the end of the game. I will give them this though, the storyline to the sister in the game-absolutely wonderful, too bad it wasn't the main characters story. Also, the game can be finished and all side-quests done in under 10 hours, I know this because I beat it the day I got it.Combat System: Two words- Absolutely Amazing, I have played tons of rpg's and by far this one I enjoyed the most. Its actually what kept me playing the game and beating it. I don't think I would've finished the game if the combat sucked. I haven't played the game since its actual release years ago and it just got put up on the shelf and forgotten about.You do get to have different hairstyles, tatoos, gotees and mustaches as well as physical scars but it gets old after awhile and you start not to care.With all that being said, it doesn't sound like a bad game and how is it that I give it a bad review. Well I'll explain.....I'll start off with promises that Peter Molyneux promised for the game and the absolute linear game that I am still mad about.....Promised:1. A full world to roam around and explore2. Aging process3. Killing kids and kids dressing up like you when you enter towns if you are good.4. Being able to turn a town into a ghost town5. Being able to be good during the day and evil during the night6. Kill a band of thieves for a town and return to the town and they hate you because a more evil band threatens them7. Plant an acorn and return to see it become a tree8. Having a wife and kids and the kid will either love you or hate you-if the kid hates you, the kid will try and kill you9. Body developments depending on wether you use magic or weaponsWhat did you actually get:1. A very linear game that doesn't let you go off the beaten path, no exploration required. A side note: My favorite video game magazine ever, Play, reviewed this game and said "It's the most non-linear game I've ever played". I don't think I got the same copy that reviewer got and I still love my Play magazine and that has been one of the few reviews I've disagreed with them on.2. Okay, my character ages, but what about everyone else-after it said two weeks in the game my character was 80 something which made me older than my mom in the game before.....3. Killing kids- I guess thats bad in a video game...so you can't. The only town that has kids is protected to where you can't draw your weapon and do anything. Also, I think only one or two kids actually "try" to dress like you but most people didn't notice. I did.4. Yes, you can wipe out a town full of all the people, however, you'll fight guards for hours until you leave the town and if you return the guards are waiting for you and "guarding" a town with noone in it.5. Without being able to explore the world you can not be good during the day and bad during the night. There was supposed to be sheep or whatever like that and at night you could go wipe out the flock and if you did enough damage it would force some of the townspeople to leave and turn the town into a ghost town6. There is only one band of thieves and they are on the "linear" path and when you kill them, no other band moves in to take the place.7. You can't plant anything8. You can have a wife and no kids. Also, you can only be with one woman in one town so if you want to have another woman you need to go to a different town. I know it is stupid to try to have 2 wives in the same village but why not try?9. Try and fight without using a sword and only using magic, its nearly impossible so you end up using a sword and your body starts gettin huge and you end up not using magic that much.So the game I was looking forward to and the game I actually got were two seperate games. I first heard about Fable, back when it was called Project Ego, almost a year before the realease of the xbox which released 3 years later after the xbox came out.Thats why this game only gets a very dissapointing 2 out of 5. If you've never heard of the game before, you will very much enjoy it, however, if you're like me you will definately want to skip this one...

This game is ever so boring. It follows the general Microsoft philosophy of features over everything else: gameplay, story, mechanics, enemy A.I., interesting characters and enemies, locations, and most importantly, fun.I'd like to quickly liken this game to Thanksgiving dinner. It's like Grandma (Micrsoft Game Studios) worked really hard on the bread, potatoes, stuffing, pie and apple cider or whatever but completely forgot to make the turkey. It's not Grandma's fault; she's old. But she doesn't try to charge you fifty bucks to eat her dinner, does she? If she does, don't eat it; many good Chinese restaurants are open on Thanksgiving. If you're not American, you might be scratching your head wondering what "Thanksgiving" is. Thanksgiving means this game sucks.To say this game pales in comparison to Halo is an understatement. This game ignored everything it could have learned from Halo. Halo had a plot, interesting characters, fluid controls, good weapons, and addictive gameplay. Brute Force has none of this.Halo was by no means a hard game, but Brute Force barely even punishes you for dying. It hurts your score? You can just keep respawning until you beat the level every time! Talk about taking any possible sense of satisfaction away that I could have gotten. To make things worse, there is basically no enemy A.I. at all. The basic gist of it is: hide behind rock, shoot, hide, shoot, hide, shoot, die. To try to conceal this, the levels were sprinkled with places where the enemy simply wouldn't appear until after I walked by them. I knew these places were coming, but there simply was nothing I could do, for the enemies didn't even exist until the instant they surrounded me. Clever, guys. Real clever.From the very beginning of this game through the ending credits, this game was the least entertaining game I've played since... well, uhh... I'm sure I can think of a game worse than Brute Force... hold on... hmm... maybe this is the worst game EVER! That is quite an accomplishment. At the very beginning, the game was terrible because I had used such rubbery controls very seldom in the past, and certainly not since Playstation (One), but by the time I got used to the controls about five minutes into the first level (it thankfully allowed me to somewhat imitate my Halo control setting), I was already bored of the wishy washy combat and crappy missions.The game has many features that I've craved ever since Perfect Dark like being able to track your kills and other stats, but some of the most important features for any modern action game are missing here: vehicles, challenge, plot, and fun.Because when it comes down to it, the most important test of any game is whether or not it's any fun, and this game just isn't any fun.

I loved the Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee and the Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus games!  The whole concept of puzzle solving raised above everything else, the idea that there is no life bar ("Do, or do not", there is no "I barely made it through, but I only lost half my life"), it's totally gutted from the game!  Argh!  Who took a great idea, an awesome concept, and pissed it all away by making it like every other game out there?!Sure, they kept the same great world, with those great characters, and the same humor, but what happened to the fundamental elements that made Oddworld stand apart from all the other games?!  Now it's more like the Ratchet & Clank, the Jax & Daxter, or the Sly Cooper games (but it's not as good as Ratchet & Clank or Sly Cooper).  What happened to the challenging puzzle solving play concepts that made the previous Oddworld games so great?!Whoever made the decision to be more like other games on the market, to stop being their own different and original game line, really screwed the pooch on this one.  This new direction in the Oddworld games makes it nothing more than one of many generic games in an over saturated genre.  It's really sad to see the great succession of Abe's Oddworld games come to this.I played this as far as I could maintain interest in it, I really wanted to see more of the world, the humor, and the clips with the Glukkons (bad guys), but the game was just lacking.  I found myself just running through areas, while just trying to avoid taking too much damage, and not really focusing on real game play.  But that was the problem: There was a lack of that challenging game play that made the Oddworld series so great.And the camera and controls were irritating.I'm through with this game: for what it is, it isn't worth playing just to try to see the interesting clips and humor that might be in there.  I might see what the next Oddworld game looks like, but if it's like this one (Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee) then I'm done with anything new from Oddworld.I am really disappointed.

the only conclusion that i can come to is that some of the rave reviews of this game were written by those who have a vested interest in you buying Brute Force.  this game is nothing special.  i swear.the graphics are ok.  they're not at the level of Halo, Splinter Cell, or Orta (or Ghost Recon, or Tides of War, or... ok, most x-box games).  i would say that this game looked pretty good if it was on the PS2 (which isn't really saying much).  the environments are kinda bland and the particle effects (gun fire, explosions, items shattering, etc.) are barely there.  the only time i thought the game looked good was using the rifle zoom and during the intro to each level.  the character movement is smooth, but they look like knuckleheads and the enemies are just goofy. you've seen better, much better.the gameplay is about as straightforward as it gets.  it's a third-person shooter so the rules are simple = if it moves, shoot it.  the path before you is totally linear, which means you'll be running along from point A to point B to point C without being able to deviate and explore the environment (which looks weak, so i guess that's not so bad).  you have objectives to complete, but those are to either to reach a checkpoint or blow something up.  sound familiar?all four characters have special abilities, but they only use them when you're in control of the character.  so, if you're playing as the guy who gets extra adrenaline to kick some tail (which is the lizard-looking creature), the character that can cloak herself to sneak around is getting shot up because you have to switch to her to use the invisibility cloak.... and when you switch, the lizard guy will stop using his boosted strength to kill because you switched characters.  in other words, the special abilities are ok when you're facing only a few enemies, but when attacked by many, they become useless.  this became one of my biggest issues with the game because the special abilities could have been much more useful.another thing that drove me nuts was that the position of the character on the screen (the one you're controlling) is all wrong.  if you're shooting at someone above or below you, the camera angle is ok.... but if the enemy is straight ahead?  you character's body gets in the way and you can't see what's coming.  sometimes you have to run to the left or right just to see what's in front of you = poor game design.the rest of the game is about as mediocre as what's already been mentioned.  the weapons fire and voice acting are ok.  the weapons offered are nothing new (the rifle zoom and targeting reticule are taken directly from Halo).  nothing about this game is really inspiring and i found myself wanting to sell it about half way through as nothing new was coming along....

Im being honest here, i dont understand how this game got good reviews here ... I didnt like this game as much as I thought I would.The value of the Cons outweigh the value of the Pros tremendously.The Pros that were enjoyable were the awesome graphics, the system of advancement is mature and the ability to race with your own music.The problem is the major cons. While there are stylish things in the game, the GAMEPLAY (TOTALLY) [is bad]. It feels like I'm driving a turtle, The cars dont go fast at all. I thought something must be wrong as I couldnt believe how slow the cars go at top speed. It's so slow it's almost silly.and I agree about the controlling the cars as some others said, its a nuisance. I mean it shouldnt be so ridiculous. I just want to race, go fast and have fun. If you played Splashdown (awesome gameplay) you will know what I mean.The cars don't race smoothly and it isnt practical for a game. For example, you cant turn with even medium speed. You have to let go of the gas way ahead and brake completely (almost coming to a full stop) when turning.The bottom line is that yes there are cool things about the game but nothing is more important than the gameplay and it totally [bad]. As a note, I rented this game and i certainly wouldn't buy it.If you want to know what i mean by awesome gameplay for racing see "Splashdown". The engineers did an awesome job, somehow they've combined difficulty with fun and awesome speed. I completed the career and have played it so many times and I can play it all day because the racing itself is just pure fun. That's how a race game should be unlike Project Gotham.I would've gave the game a 1 but I gave it a 2 only for cool graphics, and music support.

There is a big flaw in these black controllers.  I have two black ones and two white ones.  Both black ones do not hold my rechargeable batteries properly.  A little push or bump on the battery pack will cause the controller to turn off.  This does not happen ever with the two white ones.  Other than that, what else is there to say.  They are the best design controllers for any gaming counsel ever.
I loved MK, and wanted to love this, but sadly I was disappointed....sorry fans, but I must pass on Tao Feng.it's sad since SO MUCH work went into this title....hope the next one goes better....

Want a boring experience with clumsy play control? Then pick this poor excuse for a killer app up. You will appreciate Mario and Sonic more, but that still won't get you your money back.

I never purchase 3rd party controllers, I always buy only official products but I may change that after this experience. I ordered this controller and from the first minute I started using it BOTH analog sticks contantly pan to the right making playing any FPS a headache. I requested a replacement from Amazon only to receive a Chinese knock-off controller, as soon as I started using this one the right analog stick pans up nonn-stop, it was impossible to make it stop moving. Two controllers in a row and BOTH immediately have problems? Will never buy official controllers again.
Boring!  This game has nothing to rave over and alot to dispise.  Rent it before buying, or you will be disappointed in losing 50 bucks.

I think this game needs a ladder to get above one level to Crap.

There is a big flaw in these black controllers.  I have two black ones and two white ones.  Both black ones do not hold my rechargeable batteries properly.  A little push or bump on the battery pack will cause the controller to turn off.  This does not happen ever with the two white ones.  Other than that, what else is there to say.  They are the best design controllers for any gaming counsel ever.
I loved MK, and wanted to love this, but sadly I was disappointed....sorry fans, but I must pass on Tao Feng.it's sad since SO MUCH work went into this title....hope the next one goes better....

good product but upon turning it on some LED lights were missing and i opened the controller to check and only one LED light was on the circuit board
Want a boring experience with clumsy play control? Then pick this poor excuse for a killer app up. You will appreciate Mario and Sonic more, but that still won't get you your money back.
