Half Life 2 Episode 1, es la continuacion de Half Life 2 y mucho mas.  Me atreveria a decir que a pesar de lo corto de su duraci&oacute;n, hay mucha mas diversion de la que hay en todo HL2.Salvese quien pueda-------------------Al final de HL2 el Dr. Freeman logro detener la huida del Dr. Breen y destruyo el reactor en la cima de la citadela.  Y GMan lo puso en estasis de nuevo.  Ahora la mision es escapar de ciudad 17 junto con Alyx Vance antes que el reactor explote.  Es aqui donde los problemas empiezan.Me siento solo----------------Bueno, esta vez el Dr. Freeman no est&aacute; solo, se encuentra acompa&ntilde;ado de Alyx quien esta vez har&aacute; un poco mas que solo abrir puertas y hacer comentarios graciosos.  Ahora ambos estan juntos y deben luchar para habrirse paso atravez de una ciudad en caos.&iquest;Qu&eacute;... Ya?----------------------La accion se desarrolla sin dar respiro y afortunadamente los desafios son tan variados que cuando menos lo sientas el juego termin&oacute;. El juego es relativamente corto, unas 5 o 6 horas de juego. Sin embargo la canitidad ha sido sustituida por calidad, pues al final te sentiras satisfecho y con ganas de m&aacute;s.  A esperar el episodio 2.Calificacion:Graficas: 9Sonido: 9Control: 8Historia: 8-------------Diversion: 9
Desde hace rato estos t&iacute;tulo me hab&iacute;an aburrido, sin embargo al leer algunos review en p&aacute;ginas especializadas me llam&oacute; la atenci&oacute;n los comentarios positivos que ten&iacute;a el juego, digamos que esto me anim&oacute; a adquirirlo. Oh sorpresa! todo los comentarios estaban en lo correcto. Definitivamente este juego rescata la escencia de la saga, la escencia de un juego arcade de autos de carrera. Creanme, vale la pena tenerlo, adem&aacute;s dificilmente es un juego que pierda el replay value ya que en todo momento se presenta un reto distinto.Adem&aacute;s los gr&aacute;ficos est&aacute;n muy buenos.Recomendado al 100%
Aunque no he podido utilizar todas las caracter&iacute;sticas del juego, en sus intrucciones advierte que puede haber problemas de compatibilidad con Los Sims y la expansi&oacute;n Los Sims Universitarios sino se siguen las recomendaciones de instalaci&oacute;n.Por otro lado, he bajado mas de 1000 objetos, personajes, ropas, formas de ojos, maquillaje, etc de la p&aacute;gina WDS y al comenzar el juego advierte que puede haber problemas con algunas de esas descargas y las tengo deshabilitadas mientras conozco totalmente el juego.La empresa EA Games ofrece Online un programa para chequear si las descargas est&aacute;n comprobadas y registradas en su base de datos, pero a&uacute;n as&iacute; el juego Los Sims 2 Noct&aacute;mbulos advierte que pese a esta comprobaci&oacute;n puede haber inestabilidad en el juego.Las nuevas herramientas de construcci&oacute;n son maravillosas, as&iacute; como la creaci&oacute;n de los centros nocturnos.
aunque no pueda jugar tan seguido como quiero, lo disfruto cada vez m&aacute;s, buenos gr&aacute;ficos. lo &uacute;nico que me parece exgaerado es la cantida de veces que al tirar la bola da en los palos, pero igual, da mas emoci&oacute;n al juego.
Este es uno de los mejores videojuegos hasta el momento, el tener un objetivo comun hace que se trabaje mas en equipo... el que va solo es presa facil sobre todo si el otro equipo usa tanques o helicopteros artillados... lo recomiendo 100%
Creo que es un muy bonito juego y la descripcion del partido por Luis Enrique De La Cerna es espectacular, solo jugue con el una vez ya que lo compre para un amigo, pero creo que lo comprare para mi PS3, espero que aun sea mejor.
Le compr&eacute; este juego a mis hijos para q se interesen m&aacute;s en los deportes y nada m&aacute;s y nada menos que con el deporte rey, el que m&aacute;s naciones apasiona: el f&uacute;tbol. Gran realismo en los comentarios y jugadas. Buena compra.
hay que vivirlo, sentiorlo, estar inmerso en un combate 64 vs. 64 cortriendo a la mejor dfefinicion posible con un equipo de 800$.es que este es un juego de PC, lo demas es basura...}Completamente optimizado corre en ultra en mi X6+6950+8gb ram 1333
Un juego que envicia, lo compre en el momento del lanzamiento de NFS: The Run; sin embargo le&iacute; algunos art&iacute;culos negativos sobre este, y dedici comprarme hot pursiut, el juego es muy bueno, viene con muchas opciones de juego online, El articulo llego completamente sellado, en excelentes condiciones, 100% recomendado
very gooood! thanks muy bueno. vino en excelentes condiciones, es un muy buen juego para el entretenimiento, como siempre lo mejor son los de NFS. en realidad fue muy buena compra, me gusto mucho. gracias

Update: Last week, I had a 0-0 game go to a shootout against a player named IAMCHINESE (or I_AM_CHINESE). Anyway, he used a glitch that allows you to score every time in the shootout. Why doesn't EA address these issues?I started out with high hopes for this game. However, after playing it for 3 months, my lofty expectations have turned to that all-too-familiar feeling of disappointment with an EA sports NHL hockey game.At the surface, things seem great. The graphics are attractive, and the gameplay feels responsive. I do like the skill stick; it's a great improvement to the game and it allows for more creative offense as well as defense. However, once you want more than a cursory experience of playing hockey, this game begins to unravel.I should preface the rest of this review by stating I've owned probably a dozen or more NHL games (EA's NHL series and the 2K series as well) since my first game: NHL 94 for the SNES. Also, I should let it be known that I feel the actual gameplay is the most critical feature of the hockey gaming experience. If the play is unrealistic, or if it slow and unresponsive, no amount of special franchise modes or extra bells and whistles can compensate. And my review focuses on online play, not playing against the computer.So, now to take off the gloves. This game is absolutely terrible when it comes to realistic gameplay. The main offender is, by far and away, the goaltending. NHL 09 cannot recognize the difference between good scoring chances and poor scoring chances. Goalies are simply out of this world. They don't have any problem with stopping 15-20 one-timers per game, or with gloving slapshots from 10 feet out in the slot. They'll make impossible save after impossible save and leave you in frustration. To make things more  confusing, the goalies have more trouble with shots that would normally be considered "low percentage" chances. These include unscreened wrist shots from the point, or floating, floppy backhanders that seem to find their way into the net much more often than they should. So, if you're playing this game and you want to score: don't use techniques that would make sense in an actual NHL game. You need to cheese. Find one move that works (there aren't many) and use it over and over and over. It's the only way to consistently score. It's just not any fun at all.I know that the intent is to keep scoring down, but how is it any more realistic for a goalie to make 20 impossible saves in a game compared to a 15-10 final score? Taking slapshots from the blue line is pointless. Wrist shots from the slot are pointless. One timers have a decent chance, but you'll need to shoot 10 good one timers before you can get one past the goalie without ringing it off the post or crossbar. Dekes are also another scoring possibility, but some games you'll have 5 breakaways and be unable to score on any of them. I almost feel that the game decides (before you start playing) how many goals you're allowed to score.Other problems include the stick lift and poke check. For online play, these are the most over-powered, over-used moves for defensemen. Using the stick lift, you can steal a puck from a guy who is 2-3 feet in front of you. Once in a while, you'll get a penalty for high sticking, but not often enough to keep everyone from mashing away on the stick lift button. Spamming the poke check on defense is surprisingly effective because if the puck carrier comes anywhere near the defender, the puck pops off your stick. In reality, when a defender poke checks, he is left out of position if he misses. In this game, you can simply poke, poke, poke until you get the puck.Another major flaw in the game is the ability to hit offensive players who don't have the puck. Good internet players know that you can shut down the other player's offensive chances by checking players before they receive the pass. Also, if you're trying to set up a power play, the other team can cross-check your forwards when they don't have the puck. It is almost never called. Additionally, if you get a breakway that has enough separation that makes using the stick lift impossible, the defender can dive from behind you and trip you or knock you off balance just long enough for you to lose the puck into the goalie. That is never called unless your guy actually falls over. If you're chasing after a loose puck and a player from the other team is going to barely beat you, just check him from behind right before he gets to the puck. He'll lose balance and you'll come away with the puck.The game has actual glitches too. During gameplay, sometimes your players will be set up for the one timer, but when you pass it to them, they lock up and the pass hits them in the skate while they are unable to move. I've scored goals in the shootout that don't count for some reason (they hit the net and bounced out but didn't give me a point) and I've seen goals scored where the puck never crossed the line completely. Sometimes the game will crash during online play causing you to get a loss. When attempting to change lines, the player stamina bars that you see at first are incorrect! Only when you try to switch your lines does it update with the current stamina levels. That can cause you to leave a tired line on the ice because it incorrectly showed them as rested.If you hit a player on the other team and get a delayed penalty, your player will be unable to gain possession of the puck immediately following the call, even if the puck is right underneath him. For whatever reason, a few seconds must elapse on the game clock before your guy can take control of the puck. The same thing happens when the opposition goalie passes the puck to your player: if the goalie pass comes right to your guy you can't just slap it into the empty net. Again, for whatever reason, your player can't take control of the puck. It will pass through your guy until a player on the other team comes near it. If no opposition players come near the goalie pass for a few seconds, then you can finally get the puck. By then though, the goalie is back into position.The controls, although improved, have problems. The main irritation I have is that shooting on offense is the same as checking on defense. This causes your player to cross-check the other team when you are trying to stuff in a loose puck. I also feel that the players miss the net on relatively good scoring chances way too much. I'm not sure if this is because of how I aim my shots or what, but an NHL player can hit the net on a wrist shot from the slot fairly easily. That's not the case in this game, you'll miss the net *a lot*.Another problem is player switching. When you try to switch players on defense, NHL 09 simply selects the player closest to the puck. This causes problems on defense when the guy you want to select is not necessarily the closest guy to the puck. If, for example, you are trying to catch up to the puck carrier but are a step behind, if you try to switch players and play as your defenseman who is in position, you won't be able to. You first have to make your current player skate away from the puck carrier so that your defenseman is closest. However, this takes a second and by the time you finally get control of your D-man it is often too late.Finally, your computer teammates are another source of frustration. Sometimes your D-men will change up right when the other team is coming down on an odd-man rush. Other times, your AI-controlled teammates will stand and stare at a puck as it glides by them: they won't move, in fact, sometimes, they'll move away from it. Then of course, there are the times that your teammates embrace their inner retard and skate directly into you. This often happens as you're trying to enter the offensive zone and they end up making you go offsides. On offense, sometimes your teammates will not go anywhere near the goal but instead stand on the perimeter and wait. This gives you no passing options. I've noticed that at the end of the game, the computer will force you to put out your top line even if they're dog tired and even if the other lines are not tired and even if you select one of your other lines. The computer just ignores your command and puts out the top line. Finally, if you forget to change up your lines, the computer will leave your guys out until they can't move any more. You'll have three lines with 100% stamina but the line that's out won't change up.This game isn't as fun as it was when I first picked it up. I suppose that's because most people playing online now know how to exploit the stick lift and poke check buttons and they maul your players far away from the play. New rating: Overall 2/5, Fun 2/5.
NHL games for the past years have tended to me little more than roster upgrades with a few minor gameplay improvements and very little else. But you probably didn't need to read this in order to figure this out. NHL 14 fares better than that in my opinion and is the first title since a few years to really be worth picking up. First of all, in terms of excitement EA Sports has done a good job of creating hype around the game and building anticipation and the ''I have to play this factor''. As for every year they'll tell you the gameplay is majorly improved but this time the game actually did seem improved and the addition of NHL 94 anniversary mode was a nice little touch and blast from the past. I don't buy NHL or EA Sports video games every year but this one felt like it would be worth picking up.I've been playing NHL 14 since it's release now and I finally feel comfortable reviewing it. I'll begin with the gameplay. Usually the slight additions EA add every year are cool and do add to the experience but in 14 it doesn't feel as if ''oh they added this element, cool'', it's more of a ''whoa this is different''. The gameplay is more realistic which everyone will say, but it really actually is. It plays more fluidly and feels more lifelike, everything just looks and feels better. A nice uplifting is how I'd put it. I didn't buy NHL 13, but I do own 09, 11, and 12 and it feels miles of differences in terms of pure gameplay experience. I feel like I picked a good year to buy an NHL game. The hitting and checks I find just great. The face-offs seem a little harder but it's a matter of practice and timing. The fighting is fantastic here whereas in other games it's either laughable or plain bad controls (or just plain bad), I actually like the fights in this game, the controls are excellent and it feels and looks like a real NHL fight. The graphics are incredible, particularly when you're watching replays or waiting for the action to resume, the details on the ice and the players are striking every time.The Be A Pro mode is now called Live The Life. In order to feel more realistic they added things like endorsement deals which is fairly explanatory and now you have interview screens. The interview screens are a series of questions (usually no more than 4) that affect different life ''scores''. You have four life attributes: fans, family, team and management. Every question you answer will affect those four attributes by either increasing or decreasing their value. It can get a little tough to keep all of those afloat. Every once is a while you get crucial questions, the ones that can affect your score that much more (I even got sent down to the minor leagues once because I participated in a prank). At first the first 2-3 years are very limited in terms of what you can do and the questions you get are mostly the same. After a few years you can ask for trade requests and get better money from endorsement deals. You get the idea. While it's not an amazing addition, it adds another element to the game and adds to the realism (the endorsements and trade request are very welcome).The Be A GM more has basically been kept the same, but there are more options to it's palette and the simulation speed has improved. For me Be A Pro and Be A GM modes are the reason I play these games, the real meat of the NHL video game franchise with objective, obstacles, expectations and consequences. Then there are your regular exhibition mode, season mode, online, and be a legend mode as we get each year. We get to pick the mode selection screen background to our favourite team, I wish we could also pick the players we like instead or it being chosen for us. The create a pro is improved but I felt again a little limited, I would've liked more colourful hairstyles like some of the greats or long hair or more facial hair choices etc. I figure they'll get there eventually.Now the the NHL 94 mode. It's been 20 years since this much loved title in hockey video games history and this is definitely a fun addition to the game. I seriously doubt that those who weren't around for the 94 game will spend hours playing this, for the older and nostalgic fan this is a cool addition. Being able to use the controls in all the modes is cool too. In terms of gameplay it's exactly what the 94 game was, which again might seem limited to those who are used to the current NHL titles but can be a blast to play with buddies if you're a fan like myself who has cherished that game.Only glitch I've noticed yet is when my player gets taken over and I have no control, becoming a CPU. It happened twice and can be fixed by going by putting your controller in your team again.Overal I'm very pleased with NHL 14, I couldn't have wanted much more from this and I definitely feel like it's a step up from the previous titles and worth picking up, as in not just a roster upgrade. The improvements and additions are neat, and the gameplay is the best it's ever been, add the NHL 94 Aniversary mode and you have a winner. It's not perfect but it's definitely moving forward, I've already clocked in many hours playing this and I suspect I will spend many more to come for some time to come. 4.5 out of 5.
EA's NHL 2004 is so realistic, the average gamer might not like this game. However, if you are a die-hard hockey fan and gamer, you'll eat this game up on its realism.The Good: Nearly everything. The graphics, vastly improved sound (no more cannon blasts for slap shots), better animations--board pinning, simulation gameplay, and total control keep me in awe every time I play this game. Where some may complain about the advanced control, most will appreciate the fact that you, the gamer, are in 100% control of your player--not the 50% by you with 50% computer assistance as in the past. What do I mean? Passing, stick-handling, shooting, choosing to get into fights, power level of hits and power level of dumping the puck are all "you". No more is the computer aiming your passes, making your players fight at bad times, or protecting the puck for you (you use the right analog stick to move your stick/deke away from poke checks). You have total control.Another good point in this game is the realism. No longer can one take a puck from end-to-end by just going up the boards. With computer players trying to poke check the puck away or hook at you, there is going to be the need to either pass or dump the puck in once you cross the red line (you will find yourself dumping the puck a lot--which is good). No longer can you just start taking people out of position and make big hits. This will cause opponents to drive to the net untouched and you will pay with a goal against--Remember, this is a simulation (not arcade) game. You need to play this game like you see it on TV.Another major improvement is the fighting engine. Sure it was a total joke in the past, but you are going to love it this year. No longer are there two players standing side-by-side like robots taking speedy punches from each other. This year, players grapple and struggle to get their fist to the other guys head or body. Goalies even get into the action when the game gets really heated.The Bad: There's not too much to say here, but the game isn't perfect. During the game, you will notice the computer probably gets away with more hooks than it should, but it's not a serious problem because you should be passing or dumping the puck to avoid getting angry about this (I was at first, but I don't mind anymore). Also, there seems to be a problem with your goalie staying close (or "hugging") to the post on bad angle shots--too many goals seem to go in between the post and your goalie.The only major problem I have with this game is the online play. The online server for NHL 2004 isn't nearly as good as the Madden server. It's seriously flawed with horrible glitches that need to be addressed by EA. [I have yet to get a game in due to a faceoff glitch at the beginning of the game--won't go past the opening faceoff]. EA's NHL online support is horrible and doesn't offer much support. If someone quits on you, you have no option to continue--so the game is over and done and the only thing that tells that game existed is a higher disconnect percentage under your username (you don't get a win if you had the lead when you were quit-on). The online experience seems to be okay from what I hear from other players, but it's seriously flawed.Overall, this game is nearly perfect for the gamer that want total control and a total simulation hockey game (most real on the difficult level). You can play online, but expect some problems. Putting the online problems aside, you'll love this game.To the average gamer that likes high scores and likes to go out and hit every player that moves--Stay away from this game as these things just do not happen.To the serious gamer and die-hard hockey fan--You will not be winning many games by simply hitting and shooting. Oh, no--not this year my gaming friend. You are going to have to play hockey! Go and get this game!

First of all, to explain my title, I admit that I am, primarily a Hockey fan.  I love Football as well, but Hockey is my #1 sport.Ok, that being said, I didn't write the title because I prefer Hockey over Football...I wrote it because EA Canada has truly added a boat-load of features and innovations to this game, rather than take the route that EA Tiburon has taken year in and year out, and recycle last year's game.I have been playing NHL games since the dawn of time...or at least since the first NHL game was released way back in the day.Yes, of course I LOVED NHL '94.  I loved it so much, I still wish I could play it...I've been hoping EA would make it an unlockable game in this year's version...but no such luck.Anyway, by the time NHL '07 came out, I was starting to get frustrated by the NHL games.  The controls were getting more complicated, the games were becoming less arcadey, and slower, and I just found myself losing interest and hope that the perfect Hockey game would EVER appear.NHL '08 I know restored most peoples' hope in the series, but I wasn't convinced.  I just couldn't get the dual analog stick handling down.Then...the demo for NHL '09 came out.I was skeptical at first, but the demo forces you to go through a series of tests of skill with the stick handling before it lets you play a game.This was BRILLIANT on EA Canada's part.By the third time through the tutorial, I felt comfortable enough with the controls to try the Be A Pro mode.I went out and pre-ordered the game the same day.BE A PRO mode is what I've been waiting all my Hockey-loving life for.It's Hockey with RPG elements.You basically create a player with your name, and choose whatever play-style you like (ie, Power Forward, Sniper, Dangler, etc.).You then start your career as an amateur in the AHL, on your favorite team's actual NHL minor league club, playing on the 3rd line.I cannot believe EA Canada went out and got EVERY AHL team, and player for this.  The AHL could be a game by itself!After each shift on the ice, your coach evaluates you, and the GM will also let you know if they are impressed enough with your performance to move you up to the 2nd or 1st line, with the ultimate goal of making it to the NHL and becoming a legend.You can either play this mode ONLY as your player, or if you get bored watching the game while waiting for your next shift, there is a position lock option, so if you're a RW, when your shift is over, you will control EVERY RW on your team.With every game you play, you will earn experience points, which you can use to "level up" your character...basically to increase different attributes which improves the performance of your player.I can't tell you how realistic this mode is, and how immersive.  I never would have thought it.When you play as yourself and only your position, it becomes less about accumulating ridiculous stats, and more about being an actual part of a TEAM.Also, for those people who love online play, this same feature is basically available online in the EASHL (EA Sports Hockey League).You take your created player, and either create or join a team of 6 (up to 50) and compete online for the EA Cup.This is really incredible.  If you have a team of 30 people, only 6 people can play in a game at a time...there are no line changes online...but it also means, if all 30 people are playing 5 different games, your team will benefit by earning points and rank.Awesome feature.If that wasn't enough for you, this game is chock full of modes.You can simply play a single game, or you can play Dynasty mode, practice drills, and even a shootout mode, that my girlfriend was enjoying playing with me.You can also play as the goalie in any of the modes, and while that's not my usual choice of position, after trying it out, I was really surprised by how well implemented it is, and how fun.EA Canada also took the Saved Replays option that Madden annoyingly limited and one-upped it.  You can not only upload your replays to EASports.com, but you can edit them, and save them to your hard-drive.You can also take in-game screenshots of your character and put them on your player's Hockey card.I could go on and on with this review, but it all boils down to this:BUY THIS GAME!Please support games like this, where the developers prove that they care more about their sport, than just cashing in on a new year.EA Canada has restored my faith in video-game Hockey.  They took what worked from last year, and added tons of features, and value to their game.There is truly something here for everyone, and if you are a Hockey fan, or a sports fan at all, you owe it to yourself to go out and buy this game.Go Rangers!!!10/10**UPDATE 10/19/08**While I still agree that this is the BEST Hockey game, or sports game for that matter, that I have ever played...I have to warn consumers about a MAJOR issue with the game.That being, the DISC READ ERROR.  At first, my game played beautifully for 3 or so weeks.  I never had the problems I read about on message boards.But now, as of the past 2 1/2 weeks, I have been unable to play more than ONE game.  In the Be A Pro mode (the greatest mode ever), when I have to sim days between games, the game will literally lock up, and a message will appear saying the 360 cannot read the disc.  I then get booted out to the dashboard, completely unable to PLAY the game.This is a MAJOR BUG, and one that EA has yet to fix or even address as widespread.Until EA releases a patch, I have to drop my score down to 3 stars.Please EA, don't ignore your fans...stop counting the money and release a patch.Be warned consumers...it is a great GAME...just not a great PRODUCT right now.**UPDATE 11/02/08**EA Canada's David Littman has stated on the EA Sports NHL '09 blog that a patch is indeed in the works, which will address the disc-read issue I mentioned, as well as fix a number of other problems some people (not me) have been having, including the "glitch goals", etc.So, I haven't seen it yet, but now that they are addressing these problems, I would not hesitate to HIGHLY recommend this game if you like Hockey or really, sports at all!Get it.[...]**UPDATE 12/13/08**Have downloaded the patch since its release, and also installed the game to my Hard-drive after the NXE was live, and I have had ZERO problems with this game!On EA's message boards, some owners are still complaining about game-freezing (mostly online), and disc-read errors (which I no longer have), so just be aware.I don't know if these people have downloaded the patch or not, or if they installed the game on their HDD's...but just be aware an issue exists.I, personally have no problems anymore, and stand by my review as this being the BEST NHL game ever, and in my opinion (only an opinion), the best SPORTS game ever.Good luck!
I have never before seen a game so perfectly improve on every issue its predecessor had. I'm not going to compare NHL08 with 2K8 because, frankly, most of the time that ends up becoming more a review of the companies than the product. Instead I'm going to compare 08 to 07, both EA games, and show the improvements in this game.Graphics:There is little difference between the graphics in 07 and 08, but that's not a bad thing. One of the main strengths of 07 was, in fact, its graphics engine, which looked beautiful, especially when running it in full hi-def. The models in 08 have a little more detail, but not much. One thing you will notice is how smooth 08 feels, though, as it runs at 60 fps instead of 30.AI:Here's the first major change. The AI in 07, both on your team and that of your opponent, was dumb. I didn't mind so much that your opponent AI was dumb, since I play most of my games versus a human player, but your teammates were incredibly stupid. You could have a 2-on-0 break and you might as well deke the goalie yourself, because the chances your player would be smart enough to skate with you were slim. In 08, however, the AI, both on your team and that of your opponent, is really good. First, that of your opponent. Defensemen will challenge you often. You may find that at the beginning of the game you can skate into their zone along the boards and setup, but after a bit they'll adapt to your style and make it difficult, which creates a fun (albeit sometimes frustrating) challenge. Your teammate AI is vastly improved, as well. Your teammates will setup at the point, which is my favorite pass to make. You really get the feeling that you can setup in the offensive zone, which, when you pass the puck effectively there, feels REALLY good. Powerplays now actually give you an advantage, since your teammates setup so well. Your teammates no longer run offsides like morons.Skating:If they had only improved the AI from 07, I would have been happy. That was my main complaint about the game. When I read the previews about this game and EA said they revamped the skating engine, I said "meh." Didn't seem like such a big deal, but I was completely wrong. You'll notice it as soon as you start to play, the skating is extremely fluid. You have total control of where your player goes, and it's extremely realistic. It makes it easier to avoid someone trying to check you. Since you can skate sideways, it makes it so you can skate around the blue line without accidentally pulling it back behind the line. Checking was revamped, too, and it's now much more difficult to line up a player, however it's realistic about it. If an opposing player is coming in along the boards you can line him up pretty easily; it's the open-ice check that's become difficult. That's a good thing.Goalies:One thing I loved about 07 was that the goalies moved realistically. You got the feeling that they actually were on ice and would slide. There were a lot of complaints about the bad goals in 07, and the were extremely frustrating. Most of the bad goals, however, were not from stupid goalies, but an unrealistic physics engine. I play goalie. It's pretty rare that you make a save and the puck just goes two feet straight up into the air, coming down on your back. Those things happen, but rarely. Typically, if you only get a piece of the shot, the puck will deflect AWAY from you. Of in FRONT of you. More often than not it'll go way out of play. In 07, though, the physics weren't quite right, and so those tough deflections when the goalie would just get a piece of it often led to bad goals. In 08, they didn't really play much with the physics engine, they just made the goalies better. And sometimes it's obvious that the goalie cheated so as to not let in a bad goal (the puck will be sitting on the back of his neck and he'll flop down onto his back to tie it up...without it falling into the net...?). The goalies now cover the post, which is an extremely nice touch. Goalie controls are much easier, now, as you're limited in how far you can move. You can only stay within the crease, which makes it much easier to stay in position. Goals that you score can quite literally come from anywhere; you don't have just one or two options in how you score. So a lot of the frustrating aspects of the goalies last year have been fixed; it just would have been nice to see the physics engine tweaked, as well.Sound:Gary Thorne and Bill Clement announce again in this year, and they've added a LOT of things for them to say. They still get a bit repetitive, just not nearly so much as last year. They do have great chemistry, and are not a burden to listen to like some other announcers (Madden, anyone?). One thing I noticed which baffled me is that Gary Thorne (he's the commentator, not the play-by-play...unless I got it backwards) sounds muffled in a lot of the things he says. The things from last year that are recycled sound just fine, but a lot of his new lines literally sound as if he phoned them in. It's not a huge complaint, but I just thought I'd mention it.Online:There's no lag. There's no lag!!! Finally you have total control over your players when online. There are new modes, one with team play and one with co-op teams, and online leagues have been added, which is a pretty cool feature since it means I can now play with my brother who lives thousands of miles away. One VERY annoying thing, however, is that the game will freeze here and there when connecting to the other player, and you end up having to reset the game. It's not extremely common, however I'd say one out of ten games will do this. After awhile it becomes frustrating.I've never really gone too deeply into the other modes of sports games. I like to play the dynasty modes but I never really pay much attention to contract negotiations and the like. What's important to me is that the actual game is fun to play; everything else is secondary. All in all, after playing about thirty games of 08, I can honestly say I have very few complaints. The freezing glitch I'm sure will be fixed in a patch. Other than that it's a great game, and incredibly fun to play.
I was very sceptical with this entry. I really thought it was NHL 12 and 13 with only a few improvments. I played the Demo, but I was still very undecided to get it or not since i already owned NHL 13. Finally, i gave in and sold 13 and got 14. I am very happy i did that. Now i wonder why i was so hesitant. In my opinion, this game is the best entry we have seen yet and quite possibly the last one for PS3. I find everything to be more crisp and sharp on and off the ice with this game.MENUs - I find the menus are now better organised and it is much easier to navigate to find where you want to go. A lot of options are the same as NHL 13 and previous entries, but they seem to be neater and better visually. They have changed a few ways they look, so they are not identical to 13 or 12. To me, this is the best presentation yet.LIVE THE LIFE - The revamped be a pro mode is just plain awesome. Yeah, a lot of it is the same as before, but i find the addition of the interview questions is making the whole process a lot more closer than the real thing. Some of the questions are questionable, but overall, i am very happy EA made the effort to make this mode better. My pro player was chosen 1st pick in the 2nd round by the Colorado Avalanches. Florida and Carolina had also shown interest before the draft. Glad i did not end up with them. Scored my first hat trick in my 4th pre season game. This mode is a blast. I can't say enough about this mode. Hopefully, the team decides to keep me around for the whole season.NHL 94 - This mode is alright. Not the best, but it is very fun to play it. I Would have like the old 94 roster to play with Patrick Roy in MTL, but still, it is fun to play. This mode has some violent hits and there is no penalties. Perfect mode to play with friends. Nice bonus addition.BE A GM - This mode is like previous entries, but they added a lot of littles things. I will not list them all here as you can find those out by googling it or on the NHL 14 review sites. But, i will say i really enjoy the new menus. Much easier to navigate and get things done. I also like the fact that the game now lets you know which player's position is missing when your lines are incompletes. This saves a lot of time. I also read that trades have been revamped so it is closer to reality. Works for me. I know it will never be perfect, but NHL 14 is getting a lot closer than any previous NHL entries. Can't wait to start a season and test it out more.GAMEPLAY - The gameplay is much better in my opinion. I liked the demo, but i love the final product. The skating feels more real than 13. Everything is better. Yeah, some scoring glitch are still present where you can score easy enough once you get the trick, but still, i enjoy scoring, so it does not botter me especially as i do not use these cheats scoring methods to beat the computer. I really like you can now bump goalies or hit other players the hard way. This more than likely will bring the fights. WOW this fighting engine is superbe. This is a lot of fun to fight now. I always hated the first person view fights we had for the last few years. NHL 14 does not dissappoint this year. It just feel plain awesome to beat someone and to see your player raise his hands up saying ''see ya looser''... The AI still makes questionable calls. They sometime go offside or they make bad passes, but hey...this is just like real life hockey.In conclusion, if you are like me and own or have owned NHL 13 or any other hockey games, and are undecided about this one, i recommend bying it. I am really glad i gave in and purchased this hockey game. There is much more i have to discover about this game as i only have had it for one day when writing this review. Even if there is a few bugs here and there or glitches, i still think this is the best hockey game to date. I agree it is a pain to purchase another hockey game which is not game breaking for 59$, but hey, if you can afford it, you will not regret it. I believe this one will last for a while...on the PS3 anyway.Pros+ The fun factor is definately to the roof.+ Menus revamped. Better visually and to navigate.+ New modes: Live the Life (interviews) and NHL 94.+ Gameplay mechanics are pretty damn good. Especially the new fighting engine and the hitting.+ Can now customize your controls when first inserting your game in your console.+ Tons of replay value. So many things to do.Cons- Same commentary we have been hearing for a while now, althought they added a few new ones.- The sound track can be perceived as repetitive, although i don't mind it.- The game is not completely absent of glitches although i found them to be minors.- Loading time can take a while sometime, but nothing too serious.
This is definetely by far the best NBA game to ever hit any game system up to date, made by EA Sports, NBA Live 2005 is definetely a hit sports game and always will be. I will now break down my review in terms of graphics, gameplay, audio, and online play.Graphics: The graphics in this game aren't actually all that great. They look very similar to those of NBA Live 2004 which is very dissapointing considering the how good the graphics could have been, or at least a little bit better then 2004. I'm not saying however that the graphics are bad, i'm just saying they should have been better. The player models are pretty good as well as the court designs, they look exactly the same as the real arenas especially the Key Arena and Madison Square Garden Arena, they did a wonderful job with those.One problem though with the graphics is that the players don't show that much emotion when they foul out/injure themselves/(they just hop around like kangaroos when they hurt their legs or they bend down a little bit and walk when they hurt their upper body or back)or miss a really important shot. I think they could have done a little bit of a better job with that aspect of the game.Another problem with the game is that the team coaches look exactly the same, the only difference being whether they are black or white. Also the coach movements are exactly the same everytime he is talking to the team which can get very repetitive and g@y to watch once youve already seen it.Overall though, the graphics in NBA Live 2005 are amazing and definetely not ones that you should complain to much about.Gameplay: The gameplay in NBA Live 2005 is definetely the best out of all the NBA games up to date. There are way more moves that you can perform, more dunks and by far way more realistic. You can set your plays anytime you want which make this game very easy to work your way around.One new feature about NBA Live 2005 is the all star weekend feature. It includes the following.Dunk competition- A tournament to see who can bust out the best dunk. The better the dunk, the higher the scores will be that the judges give you. This can be complicated though, as you have to sometimes press a long sequence of buttons if you want a full 10/10 points for the round. The A.I actually plays extremely well in terms of difficulty, its not like their are consistently performing the same dunks over and over. Overall, a super fun gameplay mode to play.Three point shootout- Another fun gameplay mode to play. where you basically take turns shooting three point shots from each angle at the three point line. Whoever makes the most three point shots in a minute wins. The only problem with this is that it is extremely easy to make the shots, you have to just release the shoot button just as your player reaches the height of his jump, not that hard, but definetely worth playing.Rookie challenge- I personally hate this kind of mode. You basically just play normal five on five with rookies that can hardly anything. You minus well just play a normal 5 on 5 exhibition with real teams and real players, thats much more fun. Not recommended.One problem with the gameplay i find in exhibition modes is that the A.I is quite stupid, frequently running out of bounds and not driving when they have the perfect chance to. Also, the teams aren't really balanced in terms of statistics. When it comes to the highest rated team, would you think of the Memphis Grizzlies? Didn't think so.But overall, the gameplay is really fun except for issues with the A.I and that the rookie challenge is a waste of your time.Audio: The audio in NBA Live 2005 is all rap. I guess that if you like rap, you will like the audio, but for those of you who don't, you will definetely play the game on mute. Also, the rapstars are very untalented and half of them i didn't even know about. For example, has anyone here ever heard of 5pound? Didn't think so. But stars like Young Buck make the audio listenable, but not great. Another issue with the audio is that most of the time when you first get into the game, it is the same song playing every time by Young Buck which i thought was retarded considering that he has no talent whatsoever in the rapping business, sort of like Chingy, but maybe just a little bit better then him.Online play: The online play for NBA Live 2005 is amazing. The only problem with it is that you can only play online on a normal exhibition mode, not a three point shootout/rookie challenge/dunk competition.But besides that its great. You can choose whether it is ranked or not, you can create your own private rooms inviting all stars or rookies, there are downloadable rosters, (sometimes to many) and you are able to use your communicator headset to trash talk your opponents when your winning which is really fun.One other problem though with the online play is that it frequently lags which can definetely affect the game if your trying to get the most accurate of shots or shoot your free throws, where you have to be completely accurate. You also get disconnected quite frequently, but no where near the amount of disconnects that you get with Mortal Kombat Deception thankfully.In conclusion though, the online play and the entire game is a huge success and definetely worth playing for all of you NBA fans out their, or even some of you that don't even like basketball, it is still an incredibly fun game to play when your talking about any terms, whether its the new features or the old.

So first off let me say, i have NOT played an NHL hockey game since they went on strike in '99 or 2000 (can't remember exactly which year, sorry).  So therefore i cannot judge from the past 12 years of their games.With that said, this game however is FUN, right now i am playing live the life, where i am the pro.  I enjoy it because i only need to focus on MY character, not the whole team, however on that same note, it annoys me because the team will make random passes or clear the puck way too often, when i am open or they could make a break for it.  Sometimes i wish i could just take the puck handler and get it down ice for the score, i've lost quite a few games because my guy would be on the bench waiting for his next shift and the other team scores, then i will get on the ice, get something going, only to get called back to the bench in a few seconds and i have to wait again.  However the overall of that feature is awesome, winning and losing does matter, but not as much as your person putting up good points (assits or goals) to impress the scouts and move you up to a better team.I haven't played GM yet, so i can't comment on it.  However just playing the games, are a blast.  The hard hits, fights, presentation is just awesome!Now for my negatives and why i gave it 4 out of 5.  As much fun as it is, it can be frustrating, since i am back to being new at this game, i am not on the easiest setting, but one step up, i read others have had similar issues, where your team really don't know what they are doing and won't chase the loose puck, in fact i've passed a puck to a team mate, it bouced off an opponent, but still got to him, only to have him turn around as if he was going to the bench or to be on D so the puck just hit the wall and the opponent grabbed it.  Really?!  Come on EA, real life they WATCH the puck before they just leave the area to see where it goes.  Anyhoo, also, on the lower level difficulty, the rubber banding is annoying as crap, i will score 3 to 6 goals in a game, feeling good, once im up by at least 2 or 3, they will immediately score 2 or 3 back to back to catch up.  I've had so many shutouts and i suck at those so far, and then they usually win.  I was up 6 to 2 one time, 3 period they tied me and won in overtime, seriously?  So yeah be prepared for that.Finally, my biggest gripe and probably don't matter any many, the menus are nice and options are alright, but clunky.  I went to EA's music hub, turned off the songs i disliked the most, and would go to my be a pro season.  For whatever reason, all the songs play, even the ones i turned off. In the main menu and normal game, its just the songs i want, but in live the life its like they forgot to propogate those settings over there, wouldn't that have been seen in testing?  I guess i would of checked it out first, but thats just me.Anyhoo, overall, besides my minor gripes, its a fun amazing game.  Kills time, when you need time killed ;)  And feels great to plow into that guy on the wall, hurt him, then start and win a fight against his buddy ;)  5 minutes well worth it lol.

Dragon Age: Origins Ultimate Edition1. Origins2. DLC3. Awakening1. ORIGINSBioware is one of the few developers that seem to deliver the seemingly impossible mixture between the harmony of deep storytelling and deep gameplay through a RPG genre. When other game developers seem to strive for this nirvana but continuously miss the mark it is all the more impressive to see this single RPG developer do it time and again. Back when it was thought that the RPG roots and rudimentary elements of the "good" RPG were dying out Bioware revitalized the RPG world with a defibrillation to the hearts of RPG lovers everywhere with the release of the Baldur's Gate franchise in the late 90's. Hallmarked as possibly one of the greatest RPGs of all time it raised some eyebrows when Bioware started to say "Dragon Age will be the spiritual successor to the Baldur's Gate franchise". As my score for the game may entail...SWEET PAJESUS, thank goodness they delivered. Sit through the chinwag and you'll learn a lot about the things that make Dragon Age so great, evolved, deep, linear while feeling open ended, immersive, and just plan addicting.The simple breakdown of "Dragon Age: Origins" is like so...Graphics/Character Performance and Animation - 8.5/10Fun Factor - 9/10Story - 10/10Controls- 9/10User Interfacing - 9/10Learning Curve - Hard to say...I am experienced with this gameplay style.Sound - 9/10Value - 10/10Total - 9.2 / 10Jump down to my "All in all" if you only want a brief summary. I have also put key-words in CAPS to indicate what the bulk of that specific paragraph is discussing to make the review easy to navigate to points of interest.So, you're starting Dragon Age: Origins for the first time and you've just clicked on "New Game". It has already begun. The game is already starting to reveal its deep level of RPG and CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS. When you first start you're going to have to choose from six different "Origins" stories. The prologue of the game is influenced by what type of protagonist you create right off the get-go. There are three races to choose from - Human, Elf, and Dwarf -- each with their own racial benefits. For example, Dwarfs are inherently unable to use magic thus cannot become a mage and in turn their racial ability gives them a 10% chance to have any hostile spell aimed at them fail to affect them. After your race has been chosen you must then pick one of three classes; rogue, warrior, or mage. So, you have your Dwarf rogue or warrior and then you have to pick between whether your beginnings take place as a noble or as a commoner. Other options include Humans and Elves that can become mages and no matter what choices are made mages end up with the same beginning in the Circle of Magi. No matter your chosen path of race, class, or hierarchy your origins beginning will set the mood for the rest of the game and connects you to your character and their races' way of life in the Dragon Age universe.The ORIGINS STORIES are what truly sets the stage for a genuine dark medieval fantasy universe. From the very beginning the ambience is dark and tragic. When starting as a Dalish Elf (nomad, druid-like forest dwelling elves that struggle to retain their long forgotten way of Elven life before becoming slaves to humans) you are patrolling the forest when you come across several Humans fleeing...something. When you meet one another you are both startled for different reasons. The humans are afraid of whatever is behind them and the elves are afraid that if the humans are left to continue their retreat they may tell other humans of the Dalishes' whereabouts which could endanger your loved ones and home location. You must then and there decide to kill the humans or not.When starting as a Dwarf noble you are the second born and favored son of the king of the Dwarven city of Orzammar. Your youngest brother tells you of your eldest brother's plans to have your father killed because your older brother can no longer wait to become king. Your eldest brother is murdered and you are framed for the deed. With the eldest brother murdered you are sentenced to be cast into the Deep Roads (Dark Spawn infested underground roadways) because there are far too little Dwarfs and to not have them at least die with some Dark Spawn blood on their hands would be a waste. Every origins story starts with and introduces you to this genuine dark medieval fantasy world.This dark medieval fantasy universe that feels somewhat familiar not only through similar fantasy worlds -- like Forgotten Realms or D&D; -- but also through true-to-life geographical-cultural and political nuances is an additional factor of Dragon Age's life-breath that gives it a heartbeat. For example, the neighboring nations of Ferelden and the Orlesian Empire were once warring over control of Ferelden until the Orlesians were driven out. Simple nuances like the Orlesians having a more French-esque accent really is one of the game's many finishing touches that just adds to its validity through this universe's fantasy yet displaying its tangibility through grounding realities. Orlias is not the only place that displays this level of thoroughness through detail. Zevran, for example, is a character from Antiva and sounds as though he could originate somewhere like Spain. These nuances -- some seemingly mundane or some that are pivotal to the immersion-- really add to this universe's complexities and are really what sell the game's otherwise traditional main story and take it somewhere extraordinary.The game's MAIN STORY takes hold after you have chosen your character's race, class, and hierarchy. One way or another, you're going to end in the recruitment vassalage of Ferelden's Grey Warden leader, Duncan. The properly named GREY Wardens do not have an allegiance to any specific realm or nation; they do not take hand in politics or strive for personal gain. The Grey Wardens have one duty that supersedes all other moral, ethical, political, racial, or monetary needs and that is...destroy the Dark Spawn. Wardens go where the Dark Spawn pose threat; whether it be the forests of the Dalish elves, the heart of the Tevinter Imperium, the land of Orlias, or the Dwarven cities of the Deep Roads. The Warden is born of Dark Spawn blood and they will die (hopefully covered) with it. And this origins story is no different. You and Duncan are headed straight for Ostagar where Duncan believes a true Blight is underhand.WHAT IS A BLIGHT you ask? Well, I am glad you asked. A Blight is made-up of many Dark Spawn. A Dark Spawn is a grotesque humanoid individual creature that is about as dangerous as you would imagine a blood crazed psychopath might be when armed with a sword...or magic. So, as an individual they're as easy to kill as any...blood crazed psychopath would be for a trained and battle-hardened combatant. Now these Dark Spawn individuals are quite literally...mindless idiots. The Dark Spawn individual always has a calling; something beckoning them to burrow. The Dark Spawn is always ravaging the earth to find what is calling them. This beckoning is from an Archdemon. The Archdemon is the keystone that holds the functionality of the Dark Spawn together. Once freed from their prisons under the earth's surface the Archdemon uses a type of telepathy to gather a Dark Spawn horde. The Archdemon puts initiative and coherence behind what is otherwise mindless psychopathary and turns the Dark Spawn into a wave of black, tainted, horrifying slaughter at the wake of the Archdemon's control. This driven darkness led by the twisted monstrosity that is an Archdemon is what is known as a Blight. And that is where you and Duncan are headed; straight to Ostagar where Duncan believes a true Blight is forming.After reaching the encampment of the obtuse portion that makes-up the vanguard that is OSTAGAR's hourglass design Duncan wants you to venture into the Korcari Wilds (forested wilderness) to retrieve some old, long absent treaties that promise aid to the Grey Wardens from many of the races of Ferelden in case of a Blight. You are also to bring back several vials of Dark Spawn blood. Retrieving the treaties and the blood is part of your initiation to the ranks of Grey Warden. After your initiation the Dark Spawn Blight is beginning to gather near the bottleneck of Ostagar's great forefronts. This is where the narrative yet again flexes its dark fantasy muscles as it is not all puppy dogs and flowers in this medieval fantasy universe. As the battle ensues...the accumulated forces of Ferelden crumble to the Dark Spawn's mighty Blight.As one of two remaining Grey Wardens it is your duty to use the treaties you gathered from the Korcari Wilds to gather and rally the races of Ferelden together to conquer the true Blight and sack the Archdemon.I know what you're thinking..."none of this sounds too original...a person who roams the country to gather an army for an impending war and must overcome the perplexities of racial and cultural barriers to unite them against an overwhelming foe?" And I would agree with you, but that is the beauty of the game. It is not the game's overarching storyline that generates newfound and engrossing narrative but the universe the tale takes place in instead. The world is filled with fascinating cultural nuances that are taboo, controversial, and simply interesting to learn about. And, after the battle of Ostagar you're going to get to explore those cultural nuances.This is when your true quest begins. The WORL MAP is now open revealing several different locations and the map adapts to the situation of the impending Blight war as it unfolds which details a blackness on map spreading as you progress through the game which originates at Ostagar's map marker to indicate the growth of the Blight's size and exodus from their underground labyrinths. Usually I hate when a game just simply has a map with markers and you only click on your desired location and you take no part in the adventure to said location. In the case of DA: Origins, the PLOT-POINT-TRAVEL is done in such a way that it doesn't feel like it should have been done any other way. This is how traveling works. Once you have chosen your destination your group is indicated by a dripping bloodstain that takes the roadway paths to your chosen locations. This bloodstain indication of your party will occasionally be stopped mid-travel and be put in a battle scenario against bandits, assassins, stray Dark Spawn, maybe even just a simple traveling merchant, and a number of different random situations. The addition of combat mid-travel makes the travel system not feel hollow. Also, if the game were to have an "on foot" type of travel execution the game most likely would have only felt like it was putting you into trivial fighting situations during an "on foot" excursion to your destination. So, take it from someone who basically hates plot-pointed-travel systems...it is done very well in this game.The map marks pivotal locations and you will adventure to some great ENVIRONEMENTS. The surroundings themselves can be quite fantastic in this fantasy world. The ambiences that surround you will have a diverse range of their uniqueness from place to place. From the step drops of Redcliff and their lakeside view or the towering Elvan construct turned Circle of Magi Tower these places will entice you to investigate what rests within. One of my favorite is perhaps the subterranean mountain dwelling inhabitance of the Dwarven city of Orzammar. The dwarfs seem to have almost...irrigated streams of magma to illuminate their underground city. Streams of lava cascade down handcrafted lavaways giving their city a very orange and intense feeling. Though some of the cities can feel a bit "stiff" when it comes to the liveliness of the NPCs who inhabit them and their goings-on, yet it is a great mix between feeling constructed and statuesque while still giving a breath of life to these major location's realisms.These mapped pivotal locations will lead you to and through the game's main overarching narrative. The main plot is not where the narrative or adventures of this universe stop.There are SIDE QUESTS spewing from this game that are not all simple or lack intrigue. They can be quite the opposite and are abundantly placed in major locations. These side quests are uniformly given by several "hush-hush" or publicized organizations - like the Mages' Collective, Chantry Boards, and The Blackstone Irregulars - not to mention the randomly found quest from all over that don't tie into one of these groups and your companion's personal tales which can lead to some of the game's most interesting quest lines. There is a ton to do here and many ways to go about doing it.This is because of DECISIONS AND DIALOGUE OPTIONS. Dragon Age: Origins has many pivotal events happening in the present history of the world while the Blight is looming down on the occupants of Ferelden. Decision making and dialogue options play a big part into the game and you have much influence over shaping the world around you through momentous events in your history making actions taken. Through game choice you'll decide the fate of cultures and people's lives hang in the balance more often than not. Your character does not have an actor's voice, but that does not mean your protagonist is silent. Every dialogue choice is spoken word-for-word and people react to everything you say. Depending on what you've done or said to people their tone of voice could change to excitement while engaging in conversation with you or possibly even evolve to distain. Your actions and words both speak loud in this game and have cause and effect become a noticeable reality after your chosen decisions and dialogue.Dragon Age: Origins' character performance and dialogue delivery is stellar and deserves a 10 / 10, but the mundane graphics through stiff facial animations, a drab muted color palette, and occasional graphical texture issues drag the game's otherwise outstanding VISUAL PERFORMANCE down to a an 8.5. Combat animations run flawlessly smooth, but there are not many. You have some animations for your traditional sword swings, arms spread open and back arched for that "shouting" talent (taunting), backstabbing, and the mage basically only lifts their staff into the air for every spell. So, the combat animations go through the motions very fluently yet there is only a handful to be seen. On the other hand, there are some stylishly blood splatteringly entertaining gladiatorial "finishers" that one of your characters may go through at the very end of an enemy's health. You may criss-cross slash them several times on the chest making them spin in the process, stab stomach and decapitate with your other weapon, or shield bash and stab simultaneously for a very quick and satisfying fatality. These finisher moves are quick and they do not disturb the flow of combat. Another visual aspect is that the inventory UI is beautifully crafted, easy to navigate, intuitively quick to response, but is by far more complimenting to all of these qualities on the PC version. Every inventory icon is lovingly crafted for each individual item in the game...and there is a TON of items.This brings me to the other side of the RPG coin and away from the universe and the narrative of Dragon Age: Origins and I arrive at the other deeply satisfying aspects of this wonderful RPG game; the deep gameplay.Origins' plethora of ITEMS AND GEAR is second to none. The game supports A LOT of gear and items from herbalism plants, wolf hides, fantasy materials - like Lyrium, Frost Spheres, Fire Crystal, etc. - to trap triggers, metal shards, and armor of all shapes and sizes. Your character's equipable gear slots are broken down like so. Every controllable character has two weapon sets they can swap at any given time. A weapon set consists of an off-hand slot and a main-hand slot. The archetype categories for WEAPONS are broke into melee, ranged, magic, and defensive. For melee weapons you have one-handed weapons like daggers, swords, and axes and for two-handed weapons you have swords and hammers. For ranged weapons you have short and log bows and crossbows. Defensive is broken into bucklers (small shields) and large wood and large metal shields. For magical there are staves. Damaging weapons can have up to a maximum of three-open-sockets for runes. RUNES are special little rocks that go into a weapon's socket to enhance the item's abilities. These enhancement runes have a wide range of benefits to adding different types of elemental damage or to adding physical resistance or possibly having a chance to paralyze foes on hit. The runes are broken into tiers of varying potency with five different levels of strength for each individual effect. For example, a "Novice Frost" rune will add +1 frost damage to your weapon whereas a "Grand Master Frost" rune will add +5 damage. There are also differently tiered runes in between to fill the 1-5+ frost damage void. Then there are gear slots for two rings, a belt, and a necklace which make-up the game's "ACCESSORY" slots. Then there are the actual ARMOR gear slots which are comprised of an armor slot for a helmet, gloves, boots, and chest piece. When dealing with armor parts you can get an item set bonus if you're wearing 4/4 of a specific set. For example, when wearing all of the "studded leather" parts in each armor slot you will get a "set bonus" of extra benefits in addition to the stat increases the armor may already enhance. Also, all armor and weapons can be wielded by any character that is attributed correctly with stat points for the item's requirements. Like a mage can wield a sword or wear massive full plate if they have enough strength.This brings me to STATS AND ATTRIBUTES. Each level gained you're going to get to distribute three attribute points and one skill tree point. These stats have varying different effects and are more useful for one class to the next. These attribute stats that enhance your character are Strength, Dexterity, Willpower, Magic, Cunning, and Constitution. Attributes have different degrees of effects like; melee/ranged weapon damage output, deepen stamina/mana pools to activate talents, increase spell damage and intensity, and increase the character's Health pool. Besides needing a specific amount of strength to wield a weapon or wear armor you may also need an aptitude of say dexterity or magic to be able to pick a specific talent from your skill trees. For example, "Device Mastery IV" will require 22 cunning, "Death Cloud" 34 magic, or 12 dexterity to obtain "Dual-Weapon Training". So, attribute distribution is very important to creating the character you want and obtaining the skill tree talents you want.Each class has a default set of SKILL TREES at their disposal as well as some trees that are universal to weapons and not just class. The ROGUE AND WARRIOR, for example, have an identical 3x4 skill tree that is for Dual Weapon mastery and for Archery. In addition, the warrior also has a Sword and Shield mastery and Two-handed weapon mastery where the rogue does not. The Warrior's signature tree includes things like "Threaten" which helps keep enemies focused on the warrior and "Bravery" which influences the warrior's damage, critical percentage, and attack rating which is all increased due to how many enemies the warrior is engaging over the number of two. The rogue also has a signature tree which includes things like lock picking, feign death, backstab improvements, and stealth.THE MAGE is unique and shares no skill trees in common with the other two classes. The mage is also the only class with the ability to heal their allies. The mage has something like 4-5 different "schools" of magic trees to choose from which are all 4x4. For example, "Primal" is a school of magic that has things that are elemental in nature like; "Cone of Cold", "Fire Weapons", and "Chain Lightning" whereas the "Entropy" tree has things that are more along the lines of curses like; "Vulnerability Hex", "Mass Paralyze", and "Death Cloud". The classes' default talent trees have a wide variety in builds and leave a lot up to the player to decide their character's unique build due to a range of talent tree flexibility.Besides the different classes' default skill trees there are also SPECIALIZATION SKILL BRANCHES. Specialization options are linked to the character's base class-warrior, mage, and rogue-and each character can have up to two specializations. Most companions whom join the party have one specialization pre-selected and are thus able to take one more. You are awarded a specialization skill point at level 7 and 14. All specializations require unlocking through a trainer (a person who can teach it), a manual (purchased from a store), or a plot event. Specializations can be unlocked at any level and will stay unlocked on subsequent replays. Thus, it is possible, before making a decision that will get you a specialization but will cause approval loss from party members, to save, unlock the specialization and then revert to the save before the approval loss and still have the specialization unlocked.Each class-rogue, warrior, and mage-has four different specializations to choose from. Assassin, Dualist, Ranger, and Bard for the rogue; Templar, Reaver, Berserker, and Champion for the warrior and finally Blood mage, Arcane Warrior, Shape Shifter, and Spirit Healer for the mage. Each specialization has a set of four different talents and a passive attribute bonus when initiated for said character. The specializations are where a lot of the game's diversity and deep character-party customization comes into play. With your created character's choice of two different specializations and the ability to pick at least one of every individual's second specialization for the companions you acquire on your adventure it is very interesting to see the different ways you can build a party-character to feed off of each other's abilities and builds.Less frequently when leveling you will get PROFICIENCY TREE points or "skills". How often you receive these points depends on the character's class. Rogues get them the most often which is every other level. I believe warriors get them every three levels and mages every four, but I am not certain. Proficiency skills are things like Coercion (helps you persuade people in conversations to agree with what you want), stealing, combat prowess (necessary to unlock abilities farther in skill trees), tactics (allow you to set-up more AI for your characters and their abilities), and crafting skills such as; Herbalism (potion crafting), Poison Brewing (bombs and weapon coatings), and Trap Making.Between all of these deep character customizations of armor, stats, weapons, skill trees, specialization skills, and proficiencies and then to compound it all with a group of four...it can leave an extremely malleable combat and role playing experience that is deep, extremely versatile, and very satisfying. On the other hand, if all of this sounds too in depth for you and or complex you can always just click on the "auto-level" which will distribute your stats, talents, proficiencies, and specializations for you across your characters when they level up so you don't have to.After adding all of these elements of character customization together it is time to put them into the game's functional execution and test Origins' COMBAT. First off, I have to emphasize that this is NOT an action game. Sure, it has great action visually, but you are not going to be smashing buttons and pulling off button combinations to wreak havoc like in "DMC" or "God of War". That is not what this game is about. Dragon Age: Origins is about quick thinking, tactical, and situational combat scenarios. It plays more like an MMO. You pick your target you want to go attack and then you use your skill tree talents to execute certain skills and then you auto-attack while those skills are on cool-down. On the other hand though, what makes it different than MMOs is that you can "pause-to-pick-talents" and stop time to carryout certain abilities across your filled to capacity four-person team. Thus, you're not just sitting there waiting for your skills to be off cool-down because you have to micromanage your entire team...or at least set-up decent "tactics" through those proficiency skills I mention earlier to improve the AI of your team. So, if you've ever played a MMO like World of Warcraft that is probably the best absent but associated experience to draw a parallel from. Group combat mechanics are about "Tanking", Damage, Healing, and --more often than not you're outnumbered-crowd control. The combat feels a bit like you're in an MMO dungeon but you're in control of your whole party. Cool-down timers, pause-to-pick talents, potion chugs, and tactically strategic combat scenarios make this experience feel a lot like a single-player version of an online community-based dungeon crawler.HUD details - Health, mana, stamina, of your created or currently controlled character will be down at the bottom right for Xbox. A Mass Effect-style Radial menu on the Xbox can be used to execute skill tree talents or you can have assigned abilities to X, B, Y and RT+X, B, and Y for quick access to 6 skill talents. A "Hot Bar" takes the place of this on the PC version. There is no "plot-point-to-move" ability on Xbox version. On the PC you can choose a character then a "move" icon and then point and click your cursor where you would like that character move to; all while in that "paused time interface". On the Xbox, instead you have to try and do a "hold position" command and move them individually before combat. During combat are the same bad issues, you cannot pick a character then have them execute a move across the map unless under your direct control which makes micro management and movement during combat an extreme hassle and a dangerous one at that.LEARNING CURVE- Like I said before; it is hard for me to say because I have experience with this type of gameplay and character creation/build depth. I could easily say that the level of character-group customization could be extremely daunting to someone who is new to the genre. As far as combat is related, I've heard self-proclaimed "PC and RPG expert gamers" alike commenting on how difficult Origins is on the normal difficulty even. I don't like to toot my own horn but I played it on nightmare (after level 5) and at times I thought it felt like it was on easy. So, as far as learning curve is concerned I'd have to say it is situational to how much time you've spent with this type of game. It is definitely not a "jump right in" for anyone who hasn't spent time on games with heavy stat, gear, and skill tree progression and that is not even from a gameplay-combat perspective. Though I had absolutely no trouble with the game's difficulty I have heard people that are supposed "good RPGers" having a rough time. So, all I can say to that is...I guess it's a good thing you can change the game's difficulty at any time whenever you wish during your Origins campaign.The VALUE of Dragon Age: Origins is simply fantastic. The first time I beat the game I tried to do absolutely everything I could find and I clocked in around 90 hours of gameplay time. My first play-through on the Xbox 360 (with the 3 DLCs that take place during Origins) I clocked in 102:14:12. Yes...102 hours. You could probably get through the game in about 40 if you just sped through it and barely listened to dialogue and did basically no side-quest, but you'd be doing yourself a major disservice if you played the game like that. The value is high because the number of hours spent playing is a welcome addition and you actually want to put the time in. Also, with the number of different nuances through narrative and character-team customization this game has some serious replay value.Also, as a small note, I play the game on nightmare. So, when you are gauging how long it takes me to complete something you have to consider it takes a bit longer to finish battles do to more time pausing and micromanagement and larger health pools on enemies. You might not think that would add a lot of time onto a game, but add a few more minutes per battle...a few hundred times and it tacks on some hours. In addition, I am also a slow reader and I fiddle in the skill trees and ponder for lengthy periods of time about character builds too. Also, i read the codexes entries quite often. Just something to take into consideration regarding how long I say something takes.===============ALL IN ALL: ORIGINS=============All in all, Dragon Age: Origins is a meticulously and masterfully crafted deep, deep RPG experience in which you can pause time and micromanage your party of four. And that experience is best on the PC, but the minor technical and mechanical issues of the console versions can't stop this game from blasting-off into the stratosphere no matter what platform you plan to play it on.That being said, Dragon Age: Origins' combat mechanics feel most at home when compared to the functionality of most conventional MMORPGs with cool-down timers, auto-attacking, potion chugging, and the group makeup that seem to be consistent in games like those, but set on a single-player format. A non-too original main storyline takes a backseat to the real star of the show which is the world in which all of the game's events take place and the characters that inhabit them in a brilliantly come-to-life dark medieval fantasy universe. You could easily get lost in this world with a flexible game time of 40-90 hours depending on how much time you'd like to spend in Ferelden. A great fantasy universe coupled with a multitude of different character-team builds you can create and think of with the game's wide range of skills, armor, weapons, secondary specializations, and group composition can keep you wanting to come back time and again. So, if you're a RPG fan then it is definitely time to buckle-on a shield and unsheathe a sword, possibly face a few dragons along the way, and unquestionably meet some unique and wonderful characters in this engrossing and immersive dark fantasy world because Dragon Age: Origins should not be missed by any fan of the genre.2. DOWN LOADABLE/ADD-ON CONTENTCOINSIDE WITH THE ORIGNS COMPAIGN.These DLCs will all be opened in the Origins game's world map after the completion of the Battle of Ostagar or leaving Loathering (a town right after Ostagar). These add-ons are labeled via yellow map markers or given by a NPC in your camp site.Feastday Gifts/Pranks - These items are sold by the merchant in your camp site. The gifts or pranks give a way to "play around with" your party member's love/hate of you. There are generic gifts that give a fixated number of love or hate and they're cheap to buy. There is also a specific gift for love or hate that costs nothing and will give you -/+50 to your relationship with every character obtainable. The "love" gifts can also have functionality during combat. For example, Sten's gift allows him to read from a Qunari book for the dead which revives all fallen party members during combat, Zevran gets some brandy that gives him a +2 Dexterity buff, or it can range to things that have no functionality besides from small blips of entertainment like Leliana playing some guitar or Alistair playing with a puppet. All in all, this add-on can sound seemingly useless but it really is useful. With the ability to be able to easy influence your party member's love for you it allows you to take desired avenues of dialogue and actions taken throughout the game without having to worry about the repercussions of who you're going to piss off with said decisions or actions. Of course, the game will still be extremely impacted by the choices you've made...but at least you're favorite party member wouldn't leave due to a faulty ethics choice of yours. The Feastday add-on is really an "okay I've beaten the game now I want to mess around during my next playthroughs" addition. I'd say try not to use it at all your first time into the game.Warden's Keep - Very short, possibly spanning...Continue and finish the review in its entirety with the address below.[...]
Every fifty thousand years a race of sentient alien starships, the Reapers, scour the Milky Way of organic life for unknown reasons. The time of their return is at hand and the races of the Galaxy are not ready. It took the combined firepower of several entire fleets to destroy the first Reaper scout, Sovereign. In the process the Citadel - seat of the Galactic Council - was so badly damaged that repairs will take five years to complete.The Council believes the threat is over, and discounts reports that an entire fleet of hundreds of Reaper ships is lurking beyond the Galactic Rim. Their scepticism grows when Commander Shepard, the only human to know the true extent of the threat, is apparently KIA. But, two years later, Shepard resurfaces, now working for the Cerberus organisation outside the authority of Earth or the Council. Shepard now has the resources to carry the fight to the Reapers and starts by attacking one of their servant species, the Collectors, who have been raiding human colonies in the lawless Terminus Systems. But Shepard's allegiance with a borderline terrorist organisation threatens to alienate his former allies and undermines his attempts to expose the scale of the Reaper threat.Mass Effect 2, released in 2010, is the middle volume of a computer roleplaying trilogy. Unlike a lot of such series, which are normally developed ad hoc based on the sales of the previous game, the Mass Effect series was always envisaged as a trilogy with events building from one game to the next and culminating in an epic finale (to be seen in Mass Effect 3, released next month) which pits the entire Galaxy against the invading Reapers on a massive scale. Mass Effect 2 is therefore something of a bridging game, with a surprisingly small scope compared to the events of the first or third games (these things are relative, however, as ME2 still features ferocious firefights in alien starships dozens of miles long).The game's structure sees Shepard working for Cerberus and its shadowy founder, the Illusive Man (voiced with gravitas by Martin Sheen), an alliance of former foes (Cerberus is a side-enemy in the original Mass Effect) against the dual threat of the Collectors and the Reapers. The bulk of the game is set on the new starship Normandy SR-2, with Shepard choosing what assignment to undertake next. Early assignments revolve around building up a team of allies to help in the battle. The cast of the original Mass Effect has been scattered across the Galaxy and most are unavailable to help out in the new fight (though two of them do sign up and the rest show up in cameos), so Shepard is mostly reduced to forming a new team of dubious reliability and melding them into a cohesive unit. This is done by undertaking 'loyalty missions' for each character. Whilst optional, winning each character's loyalty pays dividends for the final mission - where unreliable or disloyal characters might die, or cause others' deaths - and hugely extends the playing time of the game (doing all of these missions results in Mass Effect 2 clocking in at about 25 hours, or twice the length of the original).This structure relies on the characters being compelling. Fortunately, Mass Effect 2 is the work of BioWare, who have created some of the most memorable characters in RPG history (and one of their most famous, Minsc from Baldur's Gate, gets a couple of hilarious shout-outs in ME2). There is a sense of early disgruntlement that most of the characters you got to know over the dozen or so hours of the original Mass Effect have been jettisoned, but this is soon overtaken by an interest in the new cast. BioWare have gone to some lengths to give each character their own motivation, personality and goals, backed up by strong voice acting and some excellent writing. There's some geek-friendly casting, with the likes of Yvonne Strahovski (Chuck), Michael Hogan (Battlestar Galactica), Robin Sachs (Babylon 5/Buffy the Vampire Slayer), Keith Szarabjka (Angel) and Tricia Helfer (Battlestar Galactica) providing voices, but all do great work. Keythe Farley deserves a special mention for his exceptional voicing of Thane Krios, the spiritual assassin dying of a terminal wasting disease.Gameplay-wise, Mass Effect 2 is an evolution - critics might call it a devolution - of the mechanics in the original game. Just as the original game downplayed some traditional RPG elements (such as inventory management) in favour of shooting, Mass Effect 2 takes this even further. Character advancement through levelling is streamlined considerably, with the removal of the original game's extensive skill tree in favour of a smaller, more combat-focused levelling mechanic, whilst the inventory has simply been removed completely. Inventory-less RPGs have been made before (such as the splendid Freedom Force superhero games) but it's still disconcerting to see in action. However, more careful examination of the game reveals that many of the same tangible effects of the inventory management of the first game (upgrades to weapons, grenades, armour and abilities) still exist, but have been transferred to the new research/upgrade system.This system employs a research lab which has been installed on the Normandy. Once Shepard has recruited a scientist, he can start researching upgrades to existing weaponry, armour and abilities, or unlock new weapons altogether. He can also upgrade the Normandy's capabilities. Again, this seems optional but it plays a major role in the game's finale (extending to some characters dying if the ship hasn't reached its maximum potential). Researching doesn't come for free and resources must be gathered from planets to fund it. This leads to a side mini-game where the Normandy orbits planets and scans them for resources, launching mining probes to recover them. This system can be slightly annoying (spending significant amounts of time mining when there's Collectors to be killed can be frustrating) but it's a much more intelligent use of resources than the original game (where they existed solely as an optional mission objective to make you look good).To the meat of the game, which is the in-mission view. There are two types of mission, 'hub' missions set on planets or space stations mostly inhabited by friendlies where Shepard has to resolve issues, typically through roleplaying. The game's intelligent dialogue system (slightly refined from the original game, with the addition of Paragon/Renegade actions you can undertake in addition to the simple speaking of dialogue) comes into its own here, with Shepard using diplomacy, threats or a mixture of the two to get a favourable outcome. However, far more commonplace are combat missions where Shepard and two allies have to fight their way through various enemies to achieve a mission objective.Combat is similar to the first game, in that it emphasis cover and directly shooting enemies rather than any kind of turn-based or pause-based combat, though you can still pause the game and bring up a tactical command menu, giving orders to your troops or employing special abilities yourself. It's been refined, with a more intelligent cover system (less sticking to a wall you just happen to brush up against) and the addition of area-based damage, such as headshots. Those looking for a more RPG style of combat may be disappointed by the directness of the battles, but at the same time those used to pure shooters like the Gears of War series may find the addition of dialogue options and a great degree of player freedom and choice to be liberating. BioWare are conflating the two genres here and doing so well, but RPG fans may feel that the game is a little imbalanced towards the shooter genre. Those who like both genres (like myself) will feel more at home with the game.Overall, Mass Effect 2 is a very strong game which emphasises player choice in the fields of characterisation and story development. What you, as Shepard, say or do in the game has enormous consequences, potentially leading to most of your crew being wiped out. Decisions also have important ramifications in Mass Effect 3, which may give players pause (for example, deciding the fate of a cure to the krogan plague or whether to pit the geth and Quarians into full-scale war has little impact in Mass Effect 2 itself, but will be major plot points in the final game). Complaints that the game is a dumbed-down RPG due to a streamlining of the gameplay systems are understandable, but the game also makes great strides forward in characterisation and the impact of player choice on personal interrelationships. This is a fascinating development in the way games handle characters and how relationships between them work, and shows how games can handle these factors in a way that films and novels cannot, an important evolution in the medium.Of course, those less interested in the title's place in gaming history can ignore all of that and get on with saving the Galaxy by laying waste to everything in sight with overwhelming firepower.Mass Effect 2 (****) is a very good game, with some excellent writing, memorable characters and strong combat sequences. The reducing of RPG elements in favour of shooter ones may offend RPG purists, but overall BioWare handle the merging of the two genres successfully. The game is available now in the UK (PC, X-Box 360, PlayStation 3) and USA (PC, X-Box 360, PlayStation 3). Mass Effect 3 is released on 6 March 2012 in the USA and three days later in the rest of the world.
My jaws sunk low, self-emitting air filed around me, and stupidly I gawked at my PC screen. Since when did a game rekindle my fancy for the first form of literature I warmly embraced? Anime, at times, is juiced up with vague or unnecessary talk with global weight on crushing action, but comic books have grown as a nippy alternative to time-consuming novels with marvelously penciled scenes. Where comics like the dormant Battle Chasers and, all-time favorite, Spawn attenuated my reading and visual proclivity, Freedom Force successfully lands on the video game populace in style. Full of tantalization, the game rips a new outfit on the grounds of gaming. I haven't experienced this kind of cunning direction, ever. Irrational Games assembles a flat-out ambiance which thrusts players into thrilling heroism. The RPG/Strategy affiliation shreds awesome gameplay components. Every description in the game is an indication that the company was rapt on fashioning a game based on the comic book medium. Freedom Force takes in all the legacy and stereotypes of the 60's Silver Age, and on the videogame scale, it rumbles.Sweaty-palm action awaits as soon as you decide who to take from a pool of heroes. After selecting four members, you then jump onto the fray and gain following missions. More often than not, your elite band of defenders must put an end to rampaging supervillains along with their loyal minions. Reasonably linear, the lion's share of Freedom Force is the mastered mechanics, and the ironic yet interesting cost of being violent superheroes. Remember anime (or even Power Puff Girls) where the forces of good take it on the open streets, disregarding the safety of structures, and bulldoze it down? As Uncle Ben once said from Spidey comics, "with great power comes even greater responsibility." Ditto, here. Pedestrians mind their walks of life, cars burn rubber, and in the center, a heated clash between the forces of good and evil. Oh, dear! Oh, my! Being reckless may trigger unwanted wreckage of the city that is supposedly under your protection. Depending on your choice of attacks, Patriot City can be decimated to rubble. Strategic usage of the environment (i.e. lifting cars as projectiles) should be limited due to the sensitivity of the backgrounds. From caving buildings to impersonating Babe Ruth with traffic polls, needless destruction is booed.Devilish destruction reduces the bag of important Prestige Points. Awarded after victory, these points are applied to attain additional heroes. EXP points are also given to prime a hero's abilities or expand them. As an incentive to minimize running amok, if you fail to wisely handpick a fit squad, future supervillains will squash your band of heroes into [mush]. Ample with whirls of Real-Time frenzy, a tide of excellent RPG elements, and the aim to prevent harm on Patriot city, Freedom Force is smart as it is witty.Totally smitten with Freedom Force, it hurts to divulge the minimal frowns upon it. In fact, the game gets terribly hectic without any sign of slowing down. Selecting commands may provide golden opportunities for curt surprises from concealed enemies. Failing to detect them means your good guys go down and dead. Without radar or even a teeny map, studying your surroundings seems like a tactical joy, but the constant, overbearing work is strain for the eyes. Trust me, if you thought 4 heroes is depressing petty, it's enough with the brutal and lighting-quick square offs. Also, no automatic pausing is a pain. Frequent instances of tongue-lashing conforms with the in-game chaos. Even so, the robust personality of Freedom Force dwarfs the potholes floating around it. However, far from perfect, there is nothing quite like this and is the closest thing to match a child's interactive role in a comic book.The hero cast is intentionally cheesy as the Super Friends. Stereotypes of the 60's comics (corny dialogue) forges together and packs a full press of eccentricity. Merciless creatures alternatively keep the 90's evil-doer persona unbroken. Expect the trademark of what Marvel Comics originally gave rise to. Where DC presented the typical "superhero stops supervillain," Marvel effectively introduced a new prospective and presented the personal life of its characters. Freedom Force excels on it too. Character growth was nice to witness, but the cast is so overpopulated that various characters are overshadowed by the stars. Cheesy hallmarks and naturally droll, the clowning occasions in Freedom Force deserves recognition.Voice-overs are gallant, funny, and when called for, somber. Excellent themes manage to merge an exclusive fusion of topnotch sound quality while comic-looking graphics that are so colorfully caustic it'll have your gums bleed. Once a "FOOSH," slashed across the screen, I was tickled by my comic book sensibilities. Characters are fleshed out with exaggerated, superhero costumes and work well with the polygonal construction. The interactive 3D environment and superhero powers are very cool to watch when toyed with. The option to tailor the camera view is welcomed, especially when seconds of disorder surface. The thick quality behind every inch of comic book design has me fighting back tears."Sniff, it's beautiful man. Just beautiful."Vast in the digit of powers and tactics, the single-player is an experience of immersive frolic. Many people responded with a confounded, "huh," when I asked if they knew the existence of Freedom Force. Can anyone say, "sleeper hit." Hallmarks of the game siphons reality, and lets the boyish imaginings to roam free and putter with the infectious bounties of the game. Logging hours on the extensive single-player, the chance to shape your own characters, appearance, powers, and pick out an assortment of Marvel and DC skins, will have you brewing cup after cup of coffee. Now, to shut these blood-shot eyes. . .

Dragon Age: Origins was a decent game, but most of the good content are DLC and must be paid for to get the full enjoyment for the game. At the beginning, the player customizes their character to play with, with their race, class, origin (background story), along with how they look like. After they accomplish their origin story, evenually all 6 of the origins (City Elf, Dalish Elf, Human Noble, Dwarf Commoner, Dwarf Noble, and Magi) will come to Ostagar and becomes a Grey Warden. Soon the city is attacked and destroyed, the only survivors are the player and a junior Grey Warden named Alistair. The player is able to recruit characters from throughout Fereldon, the kingdom in which the story takes place. The player's decisions and dialogue, as well as gifts, will influence the party members' approval, which is how much they like or hate you. Having a high approval for characters will give a boost on their stats and for certain characters, a chance for romance. On the other hand, if the approval rating is extremely low, the character may leave or betray you. The recruitable characters in origins are Alistair (human warrior/templar), Morrigan (human mage/shapechanger, Leliana (human rogue/bard), Oghren (dwarf warrior/berserker), Zevran (elf rogue/assassin), Wynne (human mage/spirit healer), and Dog (Mabari Dog warrior). Later in the storyline, at the landsmeet, the player can recruit Loghain Mac Tir (human warrior/champion), but then will risk Alistair leaving the party permanently. The player is supposed to use treaties to recruit armies from different areas of Fereldon to fight the Blight, a army of Darkspawn (tainted enemies) that are led by an archdemon taking the form of a dragon.
As Shelob the Spider webs up a helpless Frodo, Sam Gamgee emerges holding up his sword.  Shouting, "Get away from him you filth!"  Sam charges the giant spider, backed up by fifty Gondor soldiers and archers.  During the same time, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are struck down by the fiery Balrog on the Pelennor fields, thus snatching away any chance of victory.  Oh yeah, and after Theoden dies at Helms Deep, valiant Boromir commands the Rohirrim to victory against Saruman.Fan fiction at work?  Nope.  Simply another day playing The Lord of the Ring:  The Battle for Middle-Earth.The Battle for Middle Earth (BFME) is a real time strategy game where the player commands either for the forces of light (Gandalf, Gondor and Rohan, etc) or the forces of Darkness (Sauron and Saruman). Throughout your playtime as either faction, you'll wage warfare against your enemies, conquer (or defend)territory, and get into lots of bloodthirsty hand to hand combat.For those who want a tactical game basaed on the utterly fantastic Lord of the Rings movies without having it be an RPG will find almost everything they could want here.  You've got large armies, many, many territories to explore (and conquer), and lots of "wow" moments that can take your breath away.At it's core, BFME is a simple, effective strategy game, and while it may not have a lot of depth, it does pack a lot of fun.  For most of the game, you'll be spending your time at various locations in Middle Earth, either defending or conquering the regions you are in (as a side note, the world map is one of the most beautiful things i've ever seen in a video or computer game.  It's absoloutly breathtaking).  At each location, you start out with a base, where you build various structures such as farms,armorsmiths, archery ranges, etc.  When you feel ready, you set out across the map to destroy the enemy, thier bases, and achieve victory.  Occasionally you get to play a special mission based directly offof the movie, such as commanding the battle against Helms Deep or leading the Fellowship through the mines of Moria.The gameplay in these missions is very simple and simplified, most likely in an attempt to be as user friendly as possible.  To keep things simple, you can only build your bases at certian-pre set locations, and within these bases, you can only build buildings at designated locations.  With this system, you can quickly build your base, collect resources (via farms, slaughterhouses, or other buildings), build up your forces and attack the enemy.  I personally like this approach, because it lets me go for all out combat rather then micro-managing my resources.  Combat,though quite simple, does require some thinking.  For example, horsemen are very effective against infantry, but if they go up against spear-carrying orcs (or other soldiers), they are in big trouble.  Archers can take down enemies from a distance, but are exceptionally vulnerable to every other type of troop.  When attacking the enemy, it's best to learn each unit's strenths and weakness, and adjust combataccordingly.When building your armies, you have lots of choices for what kinds of soldiers you'd like to have.  Gondor has good infantry, while Rohan has kick-ass horses that can mow down the majority of troops they come across.  Isengard has fearsome berserkers, wargs, and cheap yet strong Uruck-hai.  Mordor has access tostrong mountain trolls and the fearsome and formidable Mumukil (those giant elephants).  No one unit is invincible, and all can be defeated by other units using the right strategy.  For example, Mordor's trolls and mumukil are very strong, but both are extremly vulnerable to arrow fire (and they are pretty much dead if those arrows are on fire).Along with your infantry, you also have exclusive "hero" units that are stronger and more efficent in battle.  All these hero's are from the movie, such as Gandalf, Aragorn, Boromir (who lives!), Saruman, the Witch king, etc.  Even Gollum is avaliable (though he's pretty much useless).  Each hero has exclusive powers that can help them turn the tide of battle in an instant.  Saruman, for example, can temporarilly control enemy units using his oh-so-charming voice.  Legolas can unleash a very fast and furious birrage of arrows at a set target.  And Gandalf...wow.  one move, and he can destroy an entire army.  At one point, Shelob the spider is controllable as a hero! (But only if you are playing the shadow campaign).  If you wish to succed at BFME, you'll need to use your hero's efficently.And as if those heros weren't enough, you also have exclusive powers that can help turn the tide of battle in an instnat.  By killing huge amounts of enemies (or conquering regions), you can power points, which can be used to buy new powers, such as being able to summon allies (eagles, ents, elves, etc), being ableto get more resources quicker, or summoning almost invincible allies, such as the balrog and the army of the dead.  Some of these powers are incredibly useful, and amazingly cool.While the normal missions are fun, the real fun comes from playing the movie-based missions, such as Helms Deep, Minas Tirith, etc.  All of them give you the chance to play these battles in a different way then what happens in the books or the movies.  When defending Minas Tirith for example, it's possible, though difficult, to go through the entire battle (which lasts roughtly forty minutes!) without losing a single soldier!  Likewise, Saruman and his forces can either blow up the wall at Helms Deep, or they can work thier way through the keep and behind the wall.Indeed, some of the best parts of the game are "what if?" moments where you can change the story.  When Saruman burned down the door of Mirith Tirith and ran inside, followed by the Balrog, I just couldn't help but grin like a madman.  Likewise, having Treebeard crush Saruman into a bloody pulp at Isengard brought another smile to my face.  And having Shelob kill Frodo and Sam will have you grinning like the evil dark lord that you are.As a further element of challenge, each faction in the game plays differently from each other.  In general, the forces of light have stronger units with strong defenses, but have smaller armies.  Likewise, the forces of shadow have weaker units and defenses (Mordor in paticular, has very weak foot soldiers), but have the advantage of sheer numbers and a few powerful units.  I'd say that the shadow campaign is harder, especially when playing as Mordor, but it is certianlly possible to win even when playing as the harder factions.For those who are not interested in going through an entire campagin, BFME features a skirmish mode, where you can select your army, the territory, the enemy army, and then jump in to start killing each other.  With the wide range of possible battles, it's easy to come up with some great "What if" scenarios.  For example, in one battle I had Gondor fight Rohan in Fangorn forest, with Boromir leading the forces of Gondor (He killed Eowyn by the way).  It was a long battle, but eventually Gondor was triumphant.  Likewise, In another battle, I pitted the forces of Mordor against...Mordor?  The result was an hour long battle against two perfectly matched foes.  Eventually however, victory was mine, thanks to recruiting the Nazgul.Though BFME is a fun, enjoyable, and long game, there are some significant issues that need to be addressed.  Probably the greatest issue is it's simplicity.  The game can pretty much be boiled down to:  build base, build forces, attack enemy base, destroy enemy base, conquer/defend territory.  Select next territory and repeat.  Doing upwards of ten of these missions in a row can get a bit repetititve.  No matter how varied the enviornment, you're still doing the same thing over and over.  Thank goodness there are movie based missions to help break up the pace.Many people have pointed out that the armies in the game are pathetically tiny compared to the movie, and i'm afraid I have to agree with them.  When playing as the forces of light, the absoloute maximum amount of units I controlled was about seven hundred.  But it's not a huge issue because the battles are just as chaotic as the movies.  Another issue I have with the battles is the edge of the maps.  In the cinematics you see endless fields, mountains, sky, etc.  Yet in the actual game, when you reach the edge of a map, it just stops, with a huge span of darkness beyond it.  It's very jarring and unrealistic, and it is especially obvious at the black gate of Mordor.I'm also not so sure about the replay value.  When you finish either campaign, you get a fast twenty second cinematic, followed by the campagin totals, and the credits.  A bit unsatisfying, and it doesn't really leave one wanting to play again.  The replay value is there, but it's not one of those "Jump back in right away" games.Another quibble that I have is the issue of replays.  The game automatically saves a replay of multiplayer missions, but not of single player missions.  Why?  So if you play an incredible, last ditch defense, save the day mission, you can't save it.  You'll never be able to see what happened in that mission ever again.  It's a big disapointment that EA did not include this feature.But in the end, BFME is a fun, exciting game that will bring a lot of satisfaction and fun to a lord of the rings fan, even if they are not big on strategy games as I am.  If you have a powerful enough computer, then I highly recommend this game.

Likewise, Saruman and his forces can either blow up the wall at Helms Deep, or they can work thier way through the keep and behind the wall.Indeed, some of the best parts of the game are "what if?" moments where you can change the story.  When Saruman burned down the door of Mirith Tirith and ran inside, followed by the Balrog, I just couldn't help but grin like a madman.  Likewise, having Treebeard crush Saruman into a bloody pulp at Isengard brought another smile to my face.  And having Shelob kill Frodo and Sam will have you grinning like the evil dark lord that you are.As a further element of challenge, each faction in the game plays differently from each other.  In general, the forces of light have stronger units with strong defenses, but have smaller armies.  Likewise, the forces of shadow have weaker units and defenses (Mordor in paticular, has very weak foot soldiers), but have the advantage of sheer numbers and a few powerful units.  I'd say that the shadow campaign is harder, especially when playing as Mordor, but it is certianlly possible to win even when playing as the harder factions.For those who are not interested in going through an entire campagin, BFME features a skirmish mode, where you can select your army, the territory, the enemy army, and then jump in to start killing each other.  With the wide range of possible battles, it's easy to come up with some great "What if" scenarios.  For example, in one battle I had Gondor fight Rohan in Fangorn forest, with Boromir leading the forces of Gondor (He killed Eowyn by the way).  It was a long battle, but eventually Gondor was triumphant.  Likewise, In another battle, I pitted the forces of Mordor against...Mordor?  The result was an hour long battle against two perfectly matched foes.  Eventually however, victory was mine, thanks to recruiting the Nazgul.Though BFME is a fun, enjoyable, and long game, there are some significant issues that need to be addressed.  Probably the greatest issue is it's simplicity.  The game can pretty much be boiled down to:  build base, build forces, attack enemy base, destroy enemy base, conquer/defend territory.  Select next territory and repeat.  Doing upwards of ten of these missions in a row can get a bit repetititve.  No matter how varied the enviornment, you're still doing the same thing over and over.  Thank goodness there are movie based missions to help break up the pace.Many people have pointed out that the armies in the game are pathetically tiny compared to the movie, and i'm afraid I have to agree with them.  When playing as the forces of light, the absoloute maximum amount of units I controlled was about seven hundred.  But it's not a huge issue because the battles are just as chaotic as the movies.  Another issue I have with the battles is the edge of the maps.  In the cinematics you see endless fields, mountains, sky, etc.  Yet in the actual game, when you reach the edge of a map, it just stops, with a huge span of darkness beyond it.  It's very jarring and unrealistic, and it is especially obvious at the black gate of Mordor.I'm also not so sure about the replay value.  When you finish either campaign, you get a fast twenty second cinematic, followed by the campagin totals, and the credits.  A bit unsatisfying, and it doesn't really leave one wanting to play again.  The replay value is there, but it's not one of those "Jump back in right away" games.Another quibble that I have is the issue of replays.  The game automatically saves a replay of multiplayer missions, but not of single player missions.  Why?  So if you play an incredible, last ditch defense, save the day mission, you can't save it.  You'll never be able to see what happened in that mission ever again.  It's a big disapointment that EA did not include this feature.But in the end, BFME is a fun, exciting game that will bring a lot of satisfaction and fun to a lord of the rings fan, even if they are not big on strategy games as I am.  If you have a powerful enough computer, then I highly recommend this game.
Bioware's 'Dragon Age: Origins' was one of my favorite games of 2009. It had a good story to tell with memorable characters and was overall a fun throwaway to the RPG days of Baldur's Gate and KOTOR. 'Dragon Age: Origins' also had bland graphics and sluggish combat controls that made it appealing only to a specific crowd. Now 'Dragon Age 2' is out and while it doesn't quite rank up there with their best titles (and borrows heavily from their other game 'Mass Effect'), it's a much more accessible experience and a solid addition to Bioware's RPG lineup!The story of 'Dragon Age 2' unfolds like a good novel: Varric, a dwarf is being interrogated by the Chantry in order to discover the location of Hawke, the "Champion of Kirkwall". You then choose Hawke's character class and (after a brief tutorial) character appearance, then play through the events that led up to the Chantry seeking Hawke and the reasons why. This "framed-narrative" structure (think 'Rashomon' or 'The Social Network') gives the plot a unique feel that is echoed throughout the game with strong characters and morally ambiguous situations. Unfortunately the overall story, involving tensions between the Mages and Templars of Kirkwall really isn't that compelling with only a few subplots that stick out (the conflicts with the Qunari and the confrontation with a certain serial-killer were the most memorable). The writing and dialogue is still very strong but we never get the sense of closure we got in 'Dragon Age Origins' or a villain as memorable as Logain (though I think Varric may be my favorite Bioware hero to date!).The visuals in 'Dragon Age 2' are a huge improvement over 'Dragon Age: Origins' as far as it's design and detail. Everything has an angular, gothic-look like it was taken from a Michael Moorcock novel and the feeling of this damaged world is reflected in characters' appearances as well as buildings and structures. The fighting animations and spells are very flashy during combat and much more varied than DA:O. I would've liked to see more variety in locations (and weather effects) as the entire game takes place in or around Kirkwall. The constant reusing of dungeons in side-quests gets really annoying after a while and is very lazy for a modern game.The sound in 'Dragon Age 2' is easily Bioware's best accomplishment! All of the characters are voice-acted to perfection (with Hawke's voice adapting to your dialogue choices as the game goes) but it's the music that really impresses. Each area of Kirkwall seems to have it's own theme (day and night) and really brings out the more downbeat tone of the game.The gameplay has changed a bit from 'Dragon Age: Origins' but not to the extent you might think. Hawke can only be a human (I miss playing an elf) and his/her background only changes somewhat depending on your character class. You use a dialogue wheel in conversations which decides Hawke's personality and can lead to some extra actions and relationships (which are MUCH easier to navigate) depending on your party members. You still collect loot off enemies and micromanage your party's weapons and items, though you can only change Hawke's armor. The combat controls are MUCH more involved and satisfying than DA:O(especially on the PS3 controller) as you have to keep pushing buttons to move around and attack. Other than that you can still pause during combat and setup tactics for your party.The one BIG difference from 'Dragon Age: Origins' to 'Dragon Age 2' is the fighting-classes: each character-class is COMPLETELY unique. Fighters are powerhouses that can engage more than one enemy at a time. Rogue's are freaking ninjas that zip around taking down enemies with arrows and daggers. Mages are effective in close-combat but can still be used to heal party members and unleash some awesome spells. The one draw-back is that each class can only use it's own specific weapons (rogue's can't use swords, fighters can't use two weapons or bows) and the skill tree encourages you to stay with one weapon set. Some skills DO change the way you fight and some of your fighting animations but for the most part you'll be using the same tactics over and over again.As a sequel 'Dragon Age 2' is a letdown with it's lack of customization, repetitive/reused environments and underwhelming story. Taken as it's own game however, with it's strong writing and satisfying combat 'Dragon Age 2' is one of the better RPG's I've played this year. Recommended!

Tiring days of 'wouldn't it be great to have a game that combines the realism, tuning, gameplay and massive car selection of Gran Turismo with all the aftermarket parts, body kits, decal customizations, and mods of Need for Speed Underground' have finally seen a dawn of new morning.  A new day that will not settle quickly like many of the other overdone street, arcade, and simulated racers on the market.  Setting this game apart is a simple concept yet ungrasped by all in it's genre.  One that should have been taken care of with the 3rd or 4th series of Gran Turismo.  Reasons for glory:1) Well over 200 cars to choose from.  Plus X amount of downloadable cars.2) Manufacturers from all over the spectrum, all over the globe have made themselves available in Forza Motorsport. BMW, Volkswagen, Porsche, Chevy, Ford, Toyota, Honda, Acura, Subaru, Mitsubishi, Ferrari, Ashton martin, Bentley, Mazda, Chrysler, Pontiac,  and Lancia to only name a few.3) Upgrades.  Upgrades.  Upgrades.  Throw in 3 or more levels of upgrades of aftermarket parts from performance tweaking: engine tuning, turbos, superchargers, air intakes, exhaust, cambers shmambers, brakes, cam shafts, throws, suspension, intercoolers, rims, and tires etc.. to body kits: hoods, hood scoops, front bumpers, side skirts, rear bumpers, spoilers, and window tint to skin visuals: custom paint jobs and an endless array of decals to slap on.  One hundred layers of decals can be applied to each section (top; roof, hood trunk, sides, and bumpers) of the car.  Many shapes, designs, and aftermarket logos can be re-sized, colorized, tilted, or spun to give your mod car endless potential.4) The gameplay of Forza is a cross between "Gran Turismo" and "RalliSport"., leaning more towards the "RalliSport" side of the house,  which translates to head-pinning ultra driving realism.  Don't like the car's handling? Upgrade the suspension, brakes, or tires or tweak them using the tuning mode.  Each and every car handles, drives and sounds the way it should.  This game offers solid control and a realistic simulated driving experience.  Difficulty level can be set to many different degrees of variation to tweak the game for a challenge that fits each individual.  Harder difficulties will award the driver more credits after each victory.  One does not have to be in first place to earn credits.  All places except for last will be rewarded credits.  Ofcourse, the higher place finishes will earn you more credits.  Credits will be subtracted from the total earned for damage penalties.  Yes, I said "Damage penalties".  Days of ramming into walls and other cars at maximum speeds with no worries of damage or hindered performance have been washed out with the tide.  This game offers one of the most realistic programmed damage engines I've seen to date.  Not only do you see damage done to your car but the damage done is different each time depending on where you are hit and how hard.  Ie Bumpers hanging off, dents, scrapes, dirt, mud, smashed tail lights, broken windows, hoods on the verge of falling off, doors smashed in, side mirrors broken off etc.. I have even seen spoilers fly off of cars in this game from the impact of rear collisions.  These types of collisions can be fun to watch to say the least, especially if you are the car who charged from behind.  Not so fun if you are driving the car that took damage.  Damage done to your car will also hinder it's performance.  Ie the car pulls to the right or left or there will be a decrease in acceleration and speed. A diagram will also flash showing where on the car that body and internal damage has been taken.  This includes wheel well, tires, steering, and surface damage.5) Events of all types will keep this game's tires burning pavement.  Events that are offered are based on Class, Horsepower, Region, AWD, RWD, FWD, Weight, Rivals such as the EVO Vs. STI, Car type, Special events, and events that become unlocked as you reach certain levels.  Your car must meet the specifications of that race to enter.  For instance, the "American Muscle" events only include cars that were made prior to 1975, obviously made in America and must have over X amount of HP and torque such as the Camaro SS, Corvette Stingray, and Dodge Challenger.  These type of events add a whole lot to the game in that it gives you an excuse to take out "Classic" cars or other specialty cars that you would normally not use in a regular event.  I've seen other games make classic cars like this unlockable, however you never get to use them because they serve no purpose for the upcoming events.  But not in Forza.  Win or buy a MUSCLE CAR and you'll have plenty of reasons to use it, which just adds to the excitement.  Like the Corvette Stingray for example, this is a great car to use in a muscle car drag event or when racing other muscle cars but cannot handle sport compact events at tracks with a lot of bends. In Forza, you can just take out the Stingray and match it with other cars of that category and genre, where it belongs.  More tracks become available as your LEVEL increases.  LEVELS increase as more credits are earned.  Credits are earned after each event.  These credits can be used to buy cars or upgrades.  After winning an entire event (an event consist of multiple races), you win a car that relates to that type of event.  Thus the stamina of replay value for this game remains strong.  In other words, addicting to the point of life consumption.6) The graphics in this game will blow your mind's transmission.  The car models in this game are nearly flawless.  You literally have to plant your face next to or on the TV to notice any pixelation.  The reflective skin of each freshly painted car render perfectly.  Microsoft is more of a master of landscapes than they are of architecture and it shows.  Their rendered "landscape" environments are refreshing and beautiful.  The rolling hills, mountains, trees, and area surfaces are some of the best I've seen.  The landscapes in FORZA come off more realistic than say "Need for Speed Underground II".  Although NFSU2 is beautifully rendered, it feels more "plastic" than real.  Which is not necessarily a "bad thing" considering it is a video game after all.  The cityscapes and buildings in FORZA are not as perfect in that they seem too organic and soft as if something out of a dream.  Can you say overdone anti-alias.  This doesn't affect it's score too much as you will be flying past them and thus the whole soft anti-alias thing will at times seem applicable.  Don't get me wrong, they are well done.  Just not up to par with Need for Speed Underground II and Gran Turismo.  Riding through New York City was dead-on with actuality in placement.  Each block, street, building, billboard were depicted almost seamless to what you would see if for some reason Time Square was actually blocked off for you to ride through it.  I think I even saw Robert Deniro trying to catch a cab.  This nearly dead-on placement accuracy is the case with most cities, areas, and actual race tracks in the game.  And you will be more than satisfied with the diversity and amount of tracks there are to choose from.To be continued..Buy this game now!!

Let me get one thing out in the open:  I am a huge fan of Acclaim's Burnout series.  The intense racing, blazing sense of speed, nerve-wracking crashes, and traffic-weaving are all amazing, and (I thought) unmatched among arcade racers.Enter Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit 2.EA's cop chaser came out about the time of Burnout 2: Point of Impact, which meant I was having such a blast with Burnout that I completely ignored NFS.  But I kept hearing about how cool NFS was, so I gave it a rent, after exhausting Burnout, and was shocked out of my socks by the result:  I think NFS: HP2 is a superior game, all things considered.I will admit that Burnout 2 looks better, runs faster, and has a certain European style that I find highly appealing - not to mention the immortal Crash Mode.  Hot Pursuit 2 might not have the technical advantages of Burnout, but what it lacks in style, it more than makes up for with substance.First off, having licensed cars DOES make a difference.  Blasting round a curve in a Ferrari is miles more sexy than speeding through the streets in a Sports Car.  And what licenses:  Porsche, Lambroghini, Aston Martin, Jaguar, BMW, Corvette!  All modeled accurately, and gorgeously - there are over forty cars in all.NFS's gameplay has more depth as well.  While Burnout can seem at times like a tech demo for its superlative crash physics, NFS concentrates strictly on the racing.  The well-rendered courses are long, with single laps lasting three minutes, and riddled with shortcuts that can make or break the race.  Should I risk taking the narrow back road through the canyon and possibly nab first place, or play it safe and hope the other guys screw up?  EA deserves a big hand for producing some of the most devious clever track designs you're likely to see.You have a wealth of options to customize the races as well.  All the cars have two different settings for handling:  Classic (i.e. safe) or Extreme (for the powerslide freaks).  You can race with commuter traffic on or off, car damage on or off, lap number, controller configuration, AI difficulty, weather conditions, camera views, HUD, car color.....I hope you're getting the picture.  You can even adjust the licensed in-game soundtrack to play instrumentals only.  Not since the Dreamcast's beloved Metropolis Street Racer has an arcade racer had so many options.There are several race modes as well, which break down roughly into two categories:  Hot Pursuit (i.e. the cops are lurking) and World Racing (no cops).  Each mode has a 30+ race bracket with individual challenges, which get progressively tougher.  The races also range from timed runs to GPs to some where you drive as the police themselves, chasing down reckless speeders under a strict time limit.  Whereas Burnout can be beaten within a rental period, it'll take quite a while to unlock everything in HP2.  And the variety, constant unlocked items, and non-linear branching gameplay ensures that it never gets repetitive.While World Racing is noteworthy in its own right, Hot Pursuit is where the gloves come off.  As you & your opponents (or a friend) barrel along the twisting roads, the police are waiting.  You've got a radar detector that lets you know when you're targeted, as well as a scanner that contains some brilliant cop commentary:  "27 to Central, I'm tracking a green Lotus Elisse that's doing 100+ and driving on the shoulder.  Let's test his air bags."  Ha ha - just try it.  Elude the black & whites for a while, and they might call for a roadblock.  Or a spike strip.  Or a bomb-dropping helicopter.  Yeah, it's all over-the-top, but oh man, what a rush:  four cops on your tail, weaving around commuter traffic, dodging bombs from above, all while hanging onto first place by the skin of your teeth.  Even the most traffic-choked Burnout streets didn't get this insane.  Then you hear that police cruiser smash into a wall, and your scanner says:  "27 to Dispatch - my cruiser is out of commission.  Am unable to continue pursuit.  Over."  Awwww yeah!Did I mention you can play as the cop and chase down your friends......even calling in the chopper and roadblocks to stop them?  And that you can unlock Corvette and Murcielago versions of a police cruiser?  Let the trash-talking begin.My intent is not to bash Burnout 2 at all - it's a definite keeper based on the amazing graphics and Crash Mode - but as far as pure pulse-pounding intense arcade racing action, I've never played anything as fun and insane as Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit 2.  Toss sim racing out the window and smash down the accelerator - this game'll give you whiplash!

Burnout 3 is the best arcade racer I have ever played, and quite possibly, the best 'traditional' racer likewise.With realistic racing sims flooding the video game market (Gran Turismo, Forza Motorsport) it is nice to see a racing game this simple, and this accessible.  This game is about fast cars, and brain-rattling car crashes.Burnout 3's racing is very straight forward, and rewards you for driving dangerously.  Racing towards oncoming traffic, narrowly avoiding traffic (think Crazy Taxi) and drifting around corners gives you boost, which you can use to increase your speed even further (emphasized by a nice blur effect).  But driving aggressively and taking out your opponents is also rewarded: knock them into the side of the track or oncoming traffic, take them out, and your boost bar wil increase in size and fill up completely.  Crash again, and your boost bar decreases, bringing a nice balance to the gameplay.The racing is ridiculously fast, and drifting around corners and weaving through traffic is addicting.  Better still, it's made more intense by a huge sense of danger...  one crash could lose you the race.The crashes, as in past Burnout games, are out of control.  The cartoony graphics don't make them any less horrifying.  That's the series' claim to fame, and it shows.  Glass shatters, metal crumples, tires fly, cars roll out of control, grinding against pavement, smashing into anything in their path...  It's something to see.Best yet, it isn't just a racer.  In World Tour mode, you'll see all kinds of events (many that you can play on their own any time you want.)  These run from time trials, to Eliminator races (last car to pass the finish line each lap is eliminated until only one is left), road rage (see how many Takedowns you can achieve against three opponents until either the time runs out or your car is destroyed) to Crash mode.Crash mode is where the debris really flies.  Pick a car and barrel towards a busy intersection (with one hundred to unlock and choose from) and see how much destruction you can cause.  Once enough cars block the streets its almost disturbing watching the speeding traffic barrel into the pile-up.  Once a certain number of crashes have occurred, use the Crashbreaker, which causes your car to explode, causing more chaos, and allowing you to steer what remains of your car in slow motion towards power ups and money multipliers.Best of all, this game has a wealth of unlockables.  It keeps track of points you earn for driving well in races, monetary damage caused during crashes, takedowns achieved, and rewards you with cars, new courses, etc. for reaching certain goals.  This not only gives you great incentive to go back and play some more, it is a satisfying way to work for unlockables.This game, especially at its new lower price point, is highly recommended.
Burnout 3 is the best arcade racer I have ever played, and quite possibly, the best 'traditional' racer likewise.With realistic racing sims flooding the video game market (Gran Turismo, Forza Motorsport) it is nice to see a racing game this simple, and this accessible.  This game is about fast cars, and brain-rattling car crashes.Burnout 3's racing is very straight forward, and rewards you for driving dangerously.  Racing towards oncoming traffic, narrowly avoiding traffic (think Crazy Taxi) and drifting around corners gives you boost, which you can use to increase your speed even further (emphasized by a nice blur effect).  But driving aggressively and taking out your opponents is also rewarded: knock them into the side of the track or oncoming traffic, take them out, and your boost bar wil increase in size and fill up completely.  Crash again, and your boost bar decreases, bringing a nice balance to the gameplay.The racing is ridiculously fast, and drifting around corners and weaving through traffic is addicting.  Better still, it's made more intense by a huge sense of danger...  one crash could lose you the race.The crashes, as in past Burnout games, are out of control.  The cartoony graphics don't make them any less horrifying.  That's the series' claim to fame, and it shows.  Glass shatters, metal crumples, tires fly, cars roll out of control, grinding against pavement, smashing into anything in their path...  It's something to see.Best yet, it isn't just a racer.

I received this game for Christmas, and it's one of the best games ever!! My family and I play this game all the time, the multiplayer is fun for the whole family! This game is very high in replay value, because you have to raise 1 million$ to buy back the bus system from Mr. Burns. Along the way, you'll be able to unlock new levels and cars. The city of Springfield is jam-packed with familiar locales, like The Simpsons house, Kwik-E-Mart, Moe's Tavern, Springfield Elementary, The Nuclear Power Plant, Springfield Mall, Krusty Burger, even Moe's ramshackled house, and many many many many more! You can fly through the streets, crashing cars and flipping them, drive off bridges and highways, run over pedestrians, smash through trees,mailboxes,playground equipment, even Groundskeeper Willy's shack, and practically anything you see. You can pick as your driver Homer,Marge,Bart,Lisa,Flanders,Moe,Snake,Rev. Lovejoy,Prof. Frink,Otto, and many more, who all have their signature cars, like Homer in the station wagon, Marge in the Canyonero, Otto in his bus, Snake in Lil' Bandit, Krusty in his clown car, Mr. Plow (Homer) in his snow plow, and Moe in his flower sedan. Everybody you see in the show is practically in the game, either as drivers, passengers, or pedestrians, and they all say hilarious phrases, like Homer saying &quot;Did I do great or really great&quot; or &quot;D'oh!&quot;, Frink saying &quot;There is so much driving, and crashing, and the hoy-glavin!&quot; or &quot;The collision! It hurts mee!&quot;  and Moe saying &quot;Hope you didn't puke&quot; or &quot;Ow! I sat on my 'roids!&quot; which will keep you laughing the whole trip through town. This is immediatly worth buying, and no Gamecube owner should be without this game. BUY! IT! NOW!

The first few moments of Dead Space 2 smartly accomplish a good deal in a very short amount of time. We get a glimpse into Isaac's psychological state, his psyche still tormented by the painful loss he experienced on the Ishimura during the events of the first game. We also learn that the three years since then have been little more than a blur to Isaac--he's in some kind of hospital facility, but has only the vaguest memories of his time there. And almost before you can say "necromorph outbreak," you take control of Isaac as he runs for his life from the hideous creatures who, for reasons that aren't immediately clear, have suddenly appeared and started slaughtering the human population here in the Sprawl, a vast urban area on Titan, Saturn's largest moon. Isaac, who said not a word in the original game, has a voice here, and although he's a bit bland as a character, the intensity of the action that surrounds him makes you feel invested in his desperate struggle for survival. Revealing glimpses into the world of Dead Space--such as a trek through a Unitology center that sheds light on the inner workings of the church whose activity is inextricably linked to the necromorph outbreaks--keep the momentum rolling during the early chapters. The game later falls into predictable rhythms for a while, but it picks up steam again toward the end, as the story goes to some unexpected and exciting places and puts almost as much emphasis on Isaac's struggle against his own demons of guilt and regret as on his battles against the necromorphs.But those battles against the hideous undead mutations remain front and center, where they belong. The key to dropping necromorphs is still blasting off their often frighteningly pointy limbs, which you do with a number of repurposed mining tools and a few actual guns, all of which feel powerful and are immensely fun to use. All of the weapons from Dead Space return in this sequel, including the plasma cutter and the line gun, which fire beams of energy capable of slicing necromorph limbs clean off. Another returning weapon is the ripper, a terrific tool whose spinning blade can result in a noisy, grisly end to necromorphs who make the mistake of getting too close to you. And there are a few new weapons as well: the detonator lets you place laser-triggered trip mines to set explosive traps for approaching necromorphs, and the javelin gun fires spikes at such a tremendous velocity that any necromorph unfortunate enough to be in their path is likely to find itself impaled to a wall.
Many survival horror fans have gotten jaded. They think the genre is dying and in one review I heard someone saying Dead Space was RE 4 in space. While dead space has similar controls as RE 4 and even an over the shoulder 3rd person view point it is NOT remotely similar to RE 4 in atmosphere or level design.For one thing,Issac is not a super elite mercenary. When the Ishumura planet resource harvester ship goes haywire Issac's job is to do some routine repairs. However there is a bit of worry right away when he receives an odd SOS from his main squeeze Nicole who is a medical officer aboard the space ship he is charged with fixing up. Luckily her message is so subtle and obscure it does not give away the whole story right away.Along with Issac is a tough as nails take charge leader type and a female crew mate who is the shiznet at hacking and cracking. While these characters "help" Issac through a holographic communications screen with advice our poor protagonist ends up separated from his team and completely alone.Dead Space is really good at telling you everything you need to know WITHOUT accessing a menu. Issac's health is measured by the glowing tubes down the spine of his armor and almost all information is relayed to him through a pop up screen device on his helmet he can manipulate at a whim. Likewise the crescent glowing icon on Issac's right shoulder gauges his "stasis energy" used to slow the opening and closing of malfunctioning doors. This makes Dead Space a more seamless experience and lulls you into a creepy train of thought of playing the game without always having the reminders it is a game.Much like Bio Shock Issac comes to terminals where he can buy equipment such as ammo, health packs, and even new weapons. Each main ability or weapon is upgraded by circular disks called "nodes" you apply at fold out work benches. Nodes are rare, luckily they can be bought as well albeit at a high price. Issac even gets telekinesis. He can move things around and toss them similar to how Gordon Friedman does with the gravity gun in Half Life 2. Add all this atop of using gravity boots to mag lock onto walls and ceilings when in zero gravity it quickly becomes apparent Dead Space is not a tired retread or lackluster clone of Resident Evil. The only similarities it bears is that it is a hybrid between action thriller and survival horror. Luckily for those of us who love a good scare it is more terrifying and surreal than it is cheesy and over the top epic.You can run and gun in dead space (further accentuating the differences between it and RE). As a matter of fact when hordes of necromorphs attack it is a good strategy to run backwards while firing away, or at least getting your bearings as you occasionally let fly with some sizzling plasma bolts.So what are necromorphs? Apparently after busting apart a planet for resources the Ishumura away team found an odd artifact with ruins on it. Somehow this began mutating crew members into monsters. While that is not very original as a concept Necromorphs make ganados and zombies look tame by comparison. Even after having legs or an arm blown off these hideous freaks will still come after you and sometimes they may play dead after you hammer into them with a few rounds. As you confidently twirl your plasma torch and turn your back "wham!" you get a bone blade appendage through your kidney for not being thorough. I wasted a lot of ammo to make sure I decapitated every dead body or slain monster. Call me paranoid but hey, I rather be safe than sorry!Each level has a series of mission objectives that range from refueling the Ishumura to recovering the captain's log. While these may seem a bit dull at least they make sense within a science fiction setting . In dead space you never have to find a ruby and an emerald then put them into the eye sockets of a gargoyle statue. Normally a puzzle requires using your telekinesis to move something or using a stasis shot to slow down a dangerous moving obstacle so you can past through into the next area.While dead space is gory it does not just rely on blood n guts to frighten you. Even when you are not attacked by necromorphs the ship's metal haul creaks menacingly and the voices of the dead are heard whispering in select locations. You even pick up data pad diaries from Ishumura's crew  and as you can well imagine their last moments were filled with dread and hopelessness. Witnessing Issac having to wrestle for his dear life while locked in the clutches of a necromorph is not nearly as bone chilling as helplessly watching the person who seems safe behind a window get impaled and dragged into the shadows screaming or having to look at a nurse cackling insanely right before she fires up a bone saw and cuts her own throat. You wonder who you have to pity more...the grotesque creatures or those who were left unaltered as normal human beings?If you approach all this from the optimistic perspective of an enthusiast instead of an embittered fan boy Dead Space is a wonderful horror game. As much as I covet RE 4 and RE 5 and herald them as awesome games they are "thrillers". Dead Space quintessentially is "true dread" pumped right into your veins. It's not toying with your emotions or trying to be something it is not.I began playing it in the day time and it still got my heart pounding. For the foolish elitist bigots out there unshakable in their stance that "western developers" don't know diddly about true horror this game has arrived to bust their chops!In closing if you have played these games for many years you're not going to jump from fright every 2 minutes. Once you become accustomed to scare tactics it can NEVER compare to the glory days when you were a virgin of the genre playing Silent Hill or RE 2 for the first time. However to me this game is so excellent at what it does it deserves some grudging respect from the survival horror community.Pros+Intriguing story+Unrelenting terrifying enemies that give their all even after their limbs fly off.+Atmospheric creepiness that balances out the blatant blood and gore+Easy to learn controls+Can run and shoot.+Things such as anti gravity exploration and using telekinesis "mix up" the usual horror experience.+No annoying menus to jolt you out of the fear. Every aspect of the game from your health to gathered information is all woven seamlessly into the technology of Issac's suit!+Issac's "weapons" are actually tools to start with reminding us he is a mechanic and not a steroid popping space marine.Con-It's a space ship so some areas get to look very much the same after awhile.-Reading text logs via Issac's holographic visor is near impossible. In my opinion everything should have been voiced.-Enemies are varied at first but get repetitive later on.Pro or con??+/- Issac is a silent faceless protagonist very much akin to the hero in Bio Shock, Gordon Friedman in Half Life 2, and Master Chief in Halo. To some of you this maybe a problem however my take on it is as follows."Issac doesn't talk but it is the very fact he doesn't spout cheesy one liners or ridiculous catch phrases that makes his struggle that much more realistic, horrifying, and genuine."+/- There's alot of gore, perhaps moreso than any other game I've played. Sadly those that pride themselves on loving "psychological horror" are going to snub their noses at Dead Space a lot for that reason alone and in so doing miss out on the parts of it that are very surrealistic, thought provoking, and haunting.
I got my little brother Dead Space for his X-Box 360 for Christmas. The game ended up spooking him enough so that he was barely able to get past the 2nd chapter, and so he flew it my way to see what I would make of it. The game took me roughly a week to polish off (between work and sleep) and I found a thoroughly frightening game with beautiful graphics and one of the spookiest atmospheres to be found in any horror/survival shooter game. Beware, a few mild spoilers ahead!Dead Space takes place in the ever far-flung future around a distant planet called Aegis VII on board a derelict mining ship called the Ishimura. It seems that that CEC (Concordance Extraction Corporation), the company which owns and operates that mammoth ship, has lost contact with it. To make matters worse the ship, populated by 1,000 miners, scientists, and ship command types, is transmitting a distress call. So the CEC sends another ship, the CEC Kellion off to Aegis VII to see what's happening. The Ishimura is an interesting vessel, officially titled a "Planet Cracker". It cuts away a huge portion of the planetary landscape, pulls it up into orbit, and commences to refining these large chunks of rock into ore. And, predictably, a ship with this capability is going to be, by necessity, a rather large vessel by default.The Kellion carries a small complement of personnel who are there to find out why the ship went silent and are tasked with repairing it. But shortly after arrival the Kellion crashes inside the landing bay of the Ishimura due to a malfunction of the guidance control. Among the personnel on the Kellion is Isaac Clarke, the story's protaganist, and the guy you'll be playing as. Seems Isaac has a girlfriend on the Ishimura named Nicole, and Nicole sent him a strange little video before the ship went offline. Isaac also happens to be an engineer, and he has a real knack for taking existing mining tools and weapons and "upgrading" them to make them very palatable for use as weapons. From the time the Kellion crashes in the Ishimura's landing bay you'll know that something has gone horribly awry because the ship seems to be deserted. By the end of the first hour of play you'll wish it *was* deserted and filled with anything *but* the nasties that now inhabit it. By the time Chapter 8 rolled around (there are 12 total) all I wanted was to go home. I did not want to be on this ship at all and the feeling of constant dread that accompanies the game really amps up the fear factor considerably and in turn makes it that much more viscerally enjoyable.Dead Space isn't a FPS but rather a Third-Person Shooter (like Tomb Raider). The view the player has is over Isaac's right shoulder, which is a bit unusual in a game of this type. There are numerous weapons for use by the player, starting with the basic Plasma Cutter (a mining tool) to the Pulse Rifle (a military assault rifle) on up to flamethrowers and a nasty little weapon called the Ripper, which teleports a circular sawblade out about 10 feet where it hovers (and in turn shreds) any mutants that happen to be standing there. All weapons have a secondary fire mode. The Plasma Cutter can swivel 90 degrees allowing you better "cutting" angles for severing limbs off of baddies, while the Line Gun can fire off a mine which deals blast damage to any monsters standing in its radius. In addition to this Isaac gets a nifty little item called a Stasis Module, which can dramatically slow down moving objects (including monsters) so that they can be bypassed or taken apart at the player's leisure. Isaac also wears a specialized suit called a RIG, with armor plates and visual aids which let the player know his current health and how much juice he has for his Stasis Module. If all else fails Isaac can use two melee attacks, one in which he stomps his rather large, armored boot on the ground (which destroys little swarming enemies) and one in which he swings a big ol' haymaker at his opponent using his weapon. It's a lot to keep track of, but after the first chapter or two much of it becomes second nature.From the get go Dead Space makes you feel very alone. The Ishimura is a *huge* ship and it is filled with hundreds of nooks and crannies potentially filled with monsters that want to dismember you piece by piece. And the monsters (named Necromorphs) are actually dead members of the original crew. And since there were originally 1,000+ crew this means a whole pile of monsters. Necromorphs come in several varieties. The most common are former humans whose arms have been transformed into stabbing weapons with long spikes where the hands used to be, while others were transformed from infants who like to crawl on walls and shoot long range barbs at you. Others have been absorbed into the ship itself and blast explosive, sentient tentacle beasts in your direction. Early in the story you're separated from your compatriots and have to work entirely alone to repair the ship and bring its basic systems back online, and Necromorphs will drop in to visit at typically the worst possible times. There were moments in the game where I audibly yelped in surprise at my TV screen as a Necromorph dropped from the air vent above me, depositing a bundle of undead nastiness right in front of me. The game is loaded with moments of this type and I found I was unable to play more than 3-4 hours at a time because it was simply too much for my nerves to handle. This isn't helped by the ambient atmosphere, filled with sounds of metal clanging below you, or air vents hissing above. You're constantly looking around to see where the next attack is going to come, even when none does.The graphics for the game are really pretty and the Ishimura reminds me a great deal of the Nostromo from the movie Alien with its "used future" look. There's no doubt this is intentional and fans of Alien will probably react with the same degree of paranoia and fear inside the Ishimura. At various points around the ship the player can stock up on supplies from Stores, sort of an electronic vending machine, as well as Power Nodes, which are the critical component used to upgrade weapons and armor for use on the Work Bench. Enemies routinely drop ammunition and money (possibly what their previously living human incarnations were carrying at the time of their...necromorphing). By far the most precious commodity are the Power Nodes, and collecting them becomes a pastime of its own. They don't drop from monsters (except for one or two bosses) and can only be found in power boxes located sporadically throughout the ship, as well as being purchased for hefty sums from the Store. But even the humble Plasma Cutter can be come a customized killing machine if it is upgraded enough (the P.C. became my weapon of choice as a direct result of it).Dead Space also separates itself from the rest of the horror/shooter genre by including two very unique spins on the basic theme. The first is to be found in Zero-G operations. Newtonian physics, monsters, and loaded guns always make for an interesting experience, and the Zero-G segments tend to come across as a puzzle of sorts loaded with adrenaline. The second nuance is that there are numerous spots on the Ishimura where the hull is exposed to open space and requires that you use a finite source of oxygen in your suit. Once the O2 runs out so does your life. One can carry small oxygen canisters around with them, but they take up valuable space and when one isn't sure when these airless episodes are coming one may be disinclined to carry them. Fortunatley the player can upgrade the amount of air their RIG carries by upgrading it at the Work Bench using the aforementioned Power Nodes.Deep Space draws from many sources, but at the end of the day I was amazed at how very close in flavor it was to System Shock 2. In fact one can put the plotlines for both games side by side and say they're almost the same game, just with different names, monsters, and a few added bells and whistles to Dead Space. The plot for both involves a lone player tackling on a crew transformed after death and tackling a biological entity which controls the whole collective. Both plots involve a ship that is slowly turning into a biological organism and which have a device of some sort which instigates the whole problem in the first place (Shodan in SS2, the Marker in Dead Space). Both involve betrayal from trusted friends and sometimes even helping your enemies a bit when your purpose temporarily is in line with their goals. And both contain video and audio logs of deceased crewmembers providing hints on how to beat the Great Opponent, as well as backstory. However to say that Dead Space is a remake of System Shock 2 is a bit unfair to it too because many games have given nods to SS2 (Doom 3, Bioshock, and several others) in very similar ways. Dead Space also takes a healthy heap of atmosphere from movies like Event Horizon, the aforementioned Alien, Aliens, and yes, even a pinch from Night of the Living Dead. Thus I would sum up by saying that Dead Space is really a fusion of the best these games and movies have to offer presented to the player in a very cinematic way. It's literally like starring in your own sci-fi/horror film. And there may just be a moment that comes along and makes you soil yourself, as the title of my review indicates. Fortunately this didn't happen to me (like I'd admit it!) but I will say that when my dog came up behind me and put her cold, wet nose on my ankle at 2am I jumped 3 feet in the air. Now that, my friends, is a game!For the price Dead Space *cannot* be beaten. For a paltry $20 this is a horror/survival game that very much is worth every penny you'll pay for it. If you loved the System Shock series, Bioshock, Doom, Aliens versus Predator (PC games), and the like then you will want this game on your shelf. Now, off to go find a fresh pair of drawers.
Dead Space is a combination of BioShock, Aliens, and Resident Evil.  It's not an original game, but it combines all of these elements very well.You're part of a small patrol sent to find out why the communications systems of a planet buster suddenly went dead after finding an alien artifact.  On your arrival, you discover that the crew has been transformed into super-deadly-alien-zombies!The aliens have two purposes:1)  Make Living Things Dead2)  Harvest Dead FleshThe aliens aren't the only problem.  The ship is near an asteroid field and parts of the ship have been destroyed.  Power, Gravity, and Life Support systems are out in parts of the ship.  Assisted by 2 members of your team, via hologram-intercom, you must find a way off of the ship.Gameplay - 9The gameplay is very good.  What sets this game apart from most is that you can access a map that shows you the path to your next objective.  It literally draws a line on the map from your position to where you need to go, so you will never get lost.  You can deviate from the path as much as you want to explore, gather weapons, health, ammo, and unforunately encounter more aliens.  But you will never get lost or stuck wandering around levels like other survival horror games.The weapons are good and fun to shoot.  You have a pistol, a machine gun, a buzz-saw gun, flame thrower, etc...  all of them pefect for dismembering aliens.  The fights with aliens are fair.  It's very rare that you die and it's not your fault.  It's also rare that you die in the same place repeatedly.  If you happen to die, the checkpoints are generous and you never get set back too far.There are weapons, ammo, and health all over the ship.  There are also stores that you can access to buy or upgrade weapons.The aliens come in all shapes and sizes, too.  The combat never gets boring in this game.There are some Zero-Gravity areas.  These are incredibly cool.You also get telekinesis and stasis (which temporarily slows down objects and enemies) for puzzles and combat.Graphics - 10From the flickering lights, to the gore stained walls, to the breathtaking views of space, it all looks great.  The aliens look like creatures from John Carpenters' The Thing.Sound - 10The sound effects will make you jump.  The eerie background music sounds like a mix of the TV Show Lost and the movie Aliens.  It's perfect.Story - 7The reasons you go from objective to objective are good.  The acting is good, but there are a few plot twists that feel a bit odd.Immersion - 10There is no HUD in the game.  Instead, the health is on your character's back.  All of the information that you need to know, shows up as holograms in game.  If you see an item in a dark corner, as you approach it, a holographic window appears telling you what it is and how to pick it up.  Your inventory and map also appear as holograms.  The absense of the HUD makes the game feel more immersive.The camera is pretty close to your character which allows you to be ambushed by aliens and unlike first person games, you can actually see what horrible things are happening to your character.Scary - 9It's scary.The game is rated M for Mature for Violence and Gore and Violent Gore and Gory Violence.  Severed heads, gore, dismembered limbs in zero gravity...  The works.Replay Value - 8The game is composed of 12 Chapters that can take you 8-12 hours to finish, depending on how much exploring you do.  Once you finish the game, you get a ton of upgrades and cash and can replay the game as an action game.There are 4 Difficulty Levels from Easy to Impossible.If you want a Scary Alien Game, you have to pick this one up.  You don't even have to be an experienced gamer to finish it, either.
Dead Space puts you in the shoes of engineer Isaac Clarke, sent to the mining ship Ishimura, to help repair the ship and return the crew home. Unfortunately for everyone involved, the rescue team finds that most of the Ishimura's crew has been killed or, worse yet, transformed into hideous monsters with an unquenchable thirst for violence.Due to the nature of the creatures on board, bullets are unable to deal much damage. Isaac must instead rely on the various cutting tools he finds on board to dismember his enemies. The game features many weapons for you to use, including a plasma rifle that acts more like a traditional machine gun, and allows you to upgrade them as you see fit using the various Power Nodes you find throughout the game. The survival horror aspect comes in how you manage your items. Power Nodes lying around are fairly uncommon, but can be bought from the stores scattered throughout the ship. This means you can sacrifice supplies such as ammo and health in order to buy more nodes and upgrade your suit and weapons.The game does an excellent job with its atmosphere. The music and sound mesh well to make you careful of how you move through the corridors, and the monsters' own abilities make you wary of every corpse you find as they can be quickly turned into a powerful monster for you to kill if not dealt with.Dead Space is a lot of fun and fans of action or horror games will find something here to like.
System Shock 2 is an interesting game to review in 2013. When it first came out in 1999, it was met with a lot of praise from the gaming press, winning over a dozen awards, including several &#8220;Game of the Year&#8221; titles, and since then it has appeared on several &#8220;Greatest Games of All Time&#8221; lists. However despite the praise, not many people actually bought and played it.It feels like System Shock 2 has been granted a second chance though. The success Irrational Games has had with BioShock and BioShock: Infinite has interested people enough to want to check out System Shock 2, which was the first game Irrational created. This is great news, because while you might not expect it, I feel that System Shock 2 is the best of all the &#8220;Shock&#8221; games. It makes you realize that for all of the steps forward we have taken in terms of technology, in a lot of ways modern gameplay has taken a few steps backwards.System Shock 2 takes place aboard the world&#8217;s first Faster Than Light starship the Von Braun as well as the UNN heavy destroyer the Rickenbacker which was tethered to the Von Braun so it could make the FTL jumps as well. You, the player, wake up from Cryo Sleep 5 months after the ship has left earth. It appears that while you were sleeping some force has managed to hijack the ship. You spend much of the game trying to figure out what exactly happened while you were sleeping, getting ship systems back up and running, and coming up with a plan to stay alive. The primary story of the game is told through many audio logs scattered around the ship that were left by the dead crewmembers, as well as visual clues in the levels that shed some light on what has been going on. This was one of the first games to do this, which has only recently started to become popular.Both the Von Braun and Rickenbacker are both pretty large ships, and the game does not have any real &#8220;levels&#8221; in the traditional sense. The ships are broken up into decks (medical, engineering, hydroponics, operations, etc), and each of those decks are broken up into sectors that are separated by bulkheads which often require keycards to access.  You are always free to move back and forward between decks and sectors you have gained access to. The game treats the ships as one large persistent game world. For example, if you come across some heavy armor that you do not have the required strength to equip, you can always come back to it later once you have the required stats. Or if you drop an item in a hallway that you do not have space in your inventory for, you can come back and get it hours later if you feel the need to. In fact, this sort of back tracking is sometimes necessary, as certain areas of the ship are only accessible after you do something in a different area. While the game in linear as far as some areas are locked until you find the keycard or access codes, it often lets you tackle multiple objectives in whatever order you see fit.Speaking of stats like strength, the game has an interesting RPG like system that determines what you can and cannot do. As you complete objectives, you are granted access to &#8220;Cybernetic Modules&#8221; that you use to upgrade your cybernetic implants. You spend these points at upgrade stations around the ship. There are four main categories of upgrades: stats, psi, weapons, and tech. Stats include things like strength, endurance,  and agility. The weapons category contains sub-categories such as standard weapons, heavy weapons, and energy weapons. The tech category is where you find the skills associated with hacking, repairing, and modifying. The Psi category has five separate tiers of power, which need not be learned in order. Each tier includes seven individual powers. These powers compare pretty favorably to the plasmids from Bioshock, and include abilities like Photonic Redirection (turning yourself invisible), Enhanced Motion Sensitivity (shows enemies nearby), and Projected Pyrokinesis (shoots a ball of fire).The game has more gameplay systems then just the skills. Let&#8217;s use the weapons as an example.  Each weapon as multiple fire modes that have strengths and weaknesses, such as an overload shot for a laser pistol that does more damage but is energy inefficient. On top of this, each weapon can be modified, provided you have the appropriate skill level. Examples of modification include increasing the clip size, increasing the rate of fire and decreasing kickback. Each time you fire a weapon, its condition starts to degrade, and you must use maintenance tools to keep the weapon in working order. If you neglect a weapon long enough, it can actually break. At that point you need to repair the weapon before you can use it again. On top of this, many of the guns have different types of ammo such as armor piercing rounds and anti-personnel rounds. How does one know what type of ammo to use against each enemy? That is where researching comes in.When you kill enemies, they often leave behind organs that you can collect from their bodies. If you have a high enough research level, you can research these organs to learn more about the enemies you are facing. It will tell you what types of weapons they have resistances to, which types of weapons they are extra vulnerable  to, and it will also give you a buff to all damage done to them. Researching isn&#8217;t limited to enemy organs either. You will often find exotic weapons and items that you cannot use until you have researched what they are. Researching items requires different chemicals as well. Which chemicals are required depends on the item. Each deck of the ship has a chemical storeroom that contains a selection of most (but not all) of the chemicals that you need for research. If you are researching an item that requires a chemical that is not in the storeroom on your current deck, you will need to locate the proper chemical somewhere else.Since System Shock 2 is a survival horror game at its core, you spend a lot of time managing and rationing your supplies. You don&#8217;t always want to fight every enemy you come across, otherwise you might find yourself out of ammo. Running from or sneaking by enemies are always valid tactics. You can sometimes take more creative approaches as well, such as hacking a turret and baiting enemies into its firing range. There are also vending machines located throughout the ship, which you can spend money (Nanites) that you collect on items such as ammo and health. Not every vending machine sells everything, and you can hack the vending machines to offer you better prices. Nanites are also the currency used to hack, modify, and repair items, so it is up to you to determine the best way to use your supply of them.All of these layered gameplay systems are what make System Shock 2 stand out as surprisingly modern when compared to current games. Even Bioshock, a critically acclaimed modern game, feels a bit shallow when you compare it to System Shock 2. I would even go as far as to say Bioshock is a watered down version of System Shock 2. This complexity also opens the game up to be played multiple times, and each time you can build your character in drastically different ways. Want to play the game as a stealth character, only killing when absolutely necessary? That&#8217;s possible. What to build a melee weapons only character? That&#8217;s also possible.The only thing about System Shock 2 that feels dated are the visuals, and even that can be mitigated to some degree with mods. The story is great, the audio design is both haunting and impactful when it needs to be, and the gameplay was so far ahead of its time that even modern games feel shallow in comparison. If you can get over how the game looks, I would absolutely recommend giving this first person survival horror RPG a try. It might just be your 2013 game of the year&#8230; from 1999.
System Shock 2 is an interesting game to review in 2013. When it first came out in 1999, it was met with a lot of praise from the gaming press, winning over a dozen awards, including several &#8220;Game of the Year&#8221; titles, and since then it has appeared on several &#8220;Greatest Games of All Time&#8221; lists. However despite the praise, not many people actually bought and played it.It feels like System Shock 2 has been granted a second chance though. The success Irrational Games has had with BioShock and BioShock: Infinite has interested people enough to want to check out System Shock 2, which was the first game Irrational created. This is great news, because while you might not expect it, I feel that System Shock 2 is the best of all the &#8220;Shock&#8221; games. It makes you realize that for all of the steps forward we have taken in terms of technology, in a lot of ways modern gameplay has taken a few steps backwards.System Shock 2 takes place aboard the world&#8217;s first Faster Than Light starship the Von Braun as well as the UNN heavy destroyer the Rickenbacker which was tethered to the Von Braun so it could make the FTL jumps as well. You, the player, wake up from Cryo Sleep 5 months after the ship has left earth. It appears that while you were sleeping some force has managed to hijack the ship. You spend much of the game trying to figure out what exactly happened while you were sleeping, getting ship systems back up and running, and coming up with a plan to stay alive. The primary story of the game is told through many audio logs scattered around the ship that were left by the dead crewmembers, as well as visual clues in the levels that shed some light on what has been going on. This was one of the first games to do this, which has only recently started to become popular.Both the Von Braun and Rickenbacker are both pretty large ships, and the game does not have any real &#8220;levels&#8221; in the traditional sense. The ships are broken up into decks (medical, engineering, hydroponics, operations, etc), and each of those decks are broken up into sectors that are separated by bulkheads which often require keycards to access.  You are always free to move back and forward between decks and sectors you have gained access to. The game treats the ships as one large persistent game world. For example, if you come across some heavy armor that you do not have the required strength to equip, you can always come back to it later once you have the required stats. Or if you drop an item in a hallway that you do not have space in your inventory for, you can come back and get it hours later if you feel the need to. In fact, this sort of back tracking is sometimes necessary, as certain areas of the ship are only accessible after you do something in a different area. While the game in linear as far as some areas are locked until you find the keycard or access codes, it often lets you tackle multiple objectives in whatever order you see fit.Speaking of stats like strength, the game has an interesting RPG like system that determines what you can and cannot do. As you complete objectives, you are granted access to &#8220;Cybernetic Modules&#8221; that you use to upgrade your cybernetic implants. You spend these points at upgrade stations around the ship. There are four main categories of upgrades: stats, psi, weapons, and tech. Stats include things like strength, endurance,  and agility. The weapons category contains sub-categories such as standard weapons, heavy weapons, and energy weapons. The tech category is where you find the skills associated with hacking, repairing, and modifying. The Psi category has five separate tiers of power, which need not be learned in order. Each tier includes seven individual powers. These powers compare pretty favorably to the plasmids from Bioshock, and include abilities like Photonic Redirection (turning yourself invisible), Enhanced Motion Sensitivity (shows enemies nearby), and Projected Pyrokinesis (shoots a ball of fire).The game has more gameplay systems then just the skills.

I am never going into space. Never! I know it's unlikely that we will see commercial space travel in my lifetime (or at all if Einstein's theory of relativity is airtight), but in order to retreat from the horror of this game I just might run away to an island and live a life of coconuts and loincloths. Dead Space 2 ain't no tourist brochure for Outer Space.Having never played the first game I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to keep up with the story, but thankfully there is a 'previously on Dead Space' option on the main menu. You play as Issac Clarke, an engineer who wakes up on a colony on Titan to discover that a disgusting biological accident called the Necromorphs have taken over. On his way to safety he also fights against the Unitologists, a cult who worship 'The Marker', a faux religious artifact that is actually a man-made weapon that turns human DNA to sludge. The resulting Necromorphs (terrifying monsters made from re-animated human corpses) spread the chaos as Issac flees through the disintegrating colony while hallucinating his dead girlfriend as a demonic ghost.The dread in Dead Space 2 is overwhelming. It is honestly the most frightening game I have played since Condemned 2 (PS3). If you have a home cinema you can scare yourself to death by playing this at night, with the lights off, and sound turned all the way up. Every breath, every gasp, every distant rumble will make the hairs on arm stand on end, and some of the stingers (quite clever ones too) will cause your heart to stop beating.The gameplay is the over-shoulder, run-and-gun type you've seen in Resident Evils 4 and 5. I suppose it is a survival horror too, but the environments get repetitive and it goes on for a bit too long. There are 59 trophies (8 of them DLC) of which I managed to win 51%. Multiple play-throughs are required for the platinum but I appreciate my sanity too much to fight to the end more than once.I need to play something cute and happy to take the edge of now. Dead Space 2 is not for those of a nervous disposition.Graphics ASound AGameplay B+Lasting Appeal B
hese days, big-budget shooting games like Call of Duty and Battlefield are designed to be objects of obsession. They feature incredibly tight feedback loops: nearly every time you kill a enemy or achieve an objective, you get points towards new weapons that kill more efficiently and spectacularly the next time around. In 2009, Plants vs. Zombies hit upon a similarly addictive formula for 2D puzzle games: each time you successfully fend off the waves of zombies trying to reach your house &#8212; by placing, say, piranha plants and exploding chili peppers in their path &#8212; you unlock new plants and face new zombies which invite you to change up your defenses. It&#8217;s arguably that stickiness, playing &#8220;just one more round&#8221; than you intended to play, that made these games so popular.Unfortunately, that stickiness isn&#8217;t fully present in EA&#8217;s attempt to bridge the two genres: Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare. Though EA has successfully managed to turn PVZ into a bonafide online shooter while retaining much of the series&#8217; charm, it&#8217;s not an obsession so much as a casual diversion. But if you can keep your expectations in check, Garden Warfare is still loads of fun.There are three distinct game modes in Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare, and I actually found the first rather boring. &#34;Garden Ops&#34; pits you and up to three other players against wave after wave of zombies attacking your garden &#8212; a clear attempt to mimic the original two-dimensional PVZ games. It falls almost completely flat, because the 3D version doesn&#8217;t let you carefully cultivate a strategic blend of plants to deal with the oncoming horde: you are the plants, and you&#8217;ll be mindlessly gunning down zombies with little strategy to speak of. You can drop little minion plants into prearranged planters, but they&#8217;re quickly overwhelmed. Garden Ops is also surprisingly long and rather hard, particularly for new players, so it&#8217;s odd that Electronic Arts lists it as the first game mode.But I soon forgot all about &#34;Garden Ops&#34; when I dove into the real meat of the game: 24-player online skirmishes and capture-the-base turf wars where actual players also control the zombies. The 12-on-12 matches are wonderfully hectic and delightfully diverse, partially because the huge environments (including cartoony towns, suburban neighborhoods, and a castle) are well laid out, and partly because each of the four different plant and zombie heroes have distinct, satisfying playstyles. How far do you want to be from the fray? If you like getting close and personal, the Zombie Scientist&#8217;s goo shotgun will do the trick. Meanwhile, the plant team&#8217;s Cactus can snipe from a distance. There&#8217;s also the Sunflower, a support class that heals with focused beams of light, and the Foot Zoldier Zombie, which can rocket jump up to the tops of buildings and deal death from above.If it sounds like I&#8217;m describing Valve's famous cartoony action shooter Team Fortress 2, that&#8217;s no accident: Garden Warfare producer Brian Lindley readily admits that a mix of PVZ and TF2 was one of the game&#8217;s original goals. Where TF2 is a mirror match of identical character classes, though, the plants and zombie teams each feel unique. As you might expect, the plants are at their most powerful dug into the ground, and not just figuratively. The zombies don&#8217;t have a sniper like the Cactus, and the other three plants can burrow into the earth to turn into powerful stationary turrets &#8212; or in the case of the Chomper, a giant purple piranha plant that swallows enemies whole, to avoid detection by tunneling through the ground. The zombies, meanwhile, have abilities that give them enhanced mobility and devasting single use attacks, like a jackhammer that the Engineer can ride into battle like a motorized pogo stick, or the All-Star Zombie&#8217;s dash tackle which sends enemies flying through the air. The plants and zombies make excellent foils for one another, both individually and as a team.If you ask the development team, the zombies were the biggest hurdle to turning PVZ into a online shooter. From the beginning, it was clear that PVZ&#8217;s plants made sense. &#34;People were very shocked that we went from a tower defense game to a 3D shooter&#8230; but the plants were always shooting,&#34; remarks franchise manager Gary Clay. But to make the formerly one-dimensional zombies suitable for a player to control, Lindley says the team spent months designing and redesigning characters to be the right blend of comical and useful. It shows: not only do the undead feel distinct from their leafy counterparts, they&#8217;re just as likable, from the pitiful way they rapidly shamble about the stages to the inventive weaponry they wield. The Engineer&#8217;s concrete gun, complete with a miniature concrete mixer slowly spinning on the character's back, is one of my personal favorites.The best part is that the abilities really complement each character&#8217;s playstyle. While the Cactus is sniping, it can protect its flanks by dropping exploding Potato Mines and Wall-nut barricades, or even pilot a flying hunk of garlic that can drop exploding ears of corn on enemy positions. (Don't ask how.) The Scientist can close the distance to enemies with a short-range teleporter, drop a sticky grenade, then warp out once again. Some of the abilities can also be devastating when used cooperatively, such as a pair of Sunflowers healing one another while laying down cover fire, or an Engineer dropping an airstrike into the midst of a Zoldier&#8217;s smoke grenade, where foes are unlikely to notice the marker beacons soon enough to react. Particularly in the Gardens and Graveyards mode, where the zombies have to capture a series of plant gardens and can summon additional computer-controlled zombies to their aid, there&#8217;s plenty of room for clever co-op tactics.As I alluded to earlier, though, Garden Warfare isn't quite as sticky a game as its peers. There isn't a ton of content, and the progression system that works so well in Call of Duty and the original Plants vs. Zombies isn&#8217;t in full force here.While the abilities are fun and work quite well, each of the game&#8217;s eight characters only has three to work with, and you can unlock them all within a few hours of play. Afterwards, there isn&#8217;t much else to obtain that isn&#8217;t cosmetic. You can save up coins to buy packs of stickers which unlock a few permanent weapon upgrades (three per character), and some character variants with different weapons (like the Fire Flower which shoots flames instead of sunbeams), but it&#8217;s slow going even if you play fairly well. A ten-minute match might net you 2,000-3,000 coins, but buying a new character costs 40,000 coins, so that&#8217;s easily a few solid hours of your time for a single character even if you&#8217;re laser-focused on that goal. On the flip side, though, you&#8217;re also guaranteed at least 750 coins per match whether you win or lose, so you&#8217;re making at least a little progress every time you play a round.With my goal of unlocking more content in Garden Warfare a distant inevitability, I didn&#8217;t really feel the urge to stay up late playing. I&#8217;m sure that often, over the days and weeks to come, I&#8217;ll get the itch to swallow zombies with a giant piranha plant, and return for a few more rounds. But I look forward to a sequel &#8212; or maybe some DLC &#8212; that makes the game a little less limited in scope. Team Fortress 2 built an entire business out of selling items for a game like this one, and there&#8217;s no way that microtransaction-happy EA isn&#8217;t thinking about that pot of gold.In the meanwhile, Garden Warfare gets my vote for the best kid-friendly shooter on consoles.
If you say that out loud, you can see why they went with Dead Space 2.  Improved over the original, this is a white knuckled adventure that will give you the creeps, and a few scares.Story: 9/10 (Spoiler Free)Dead Space 2 begins three years after the end of the original Dead Space with Issac Clarke locked in an asylum undergoing psychological treatment for his full blown schizophrenia by a government psychiatrist... and his day just goes downhill from there.  The story of Dead Space 2 is well rendered, well acted, fast paced, suspenseful blend of action blockbuster and sci-fi horror.There are a few main characters in the story and all of them are very well written.  A few of the lines of dialogue are a bit awkward, but that's the only thing bad about the story.  It's definitely better than the stuff that Hollywood has been churning out recently.  (Smurfs in New York, M. Night's Airbender, Battle: Los Angeles)What is most impressive is that Dead Space 2 doesn't break its own fiction.  All of the game mechanics, weapons, items, upgrades, combat... make sense in their world.Graphics: 9/10The art direction is great and the atmosphere is genuinely creepy.  The space station and other levels look fantastic and their designs are interesting.  The creatures are frightening and the characters look and animate great.  The environments, characters, effects, and direction all contribute to create a believable experience.Gameplay: 8/10Dead Space 2 is a 15 Chapter Survival Horror game that takes place on a space station infected by Necromorphs.  The game is linear, but doesn't feel like artificially connected maps.  The levels blend together to make a continuously flowing story.  Save points are numerous as are stores where you can upgrade your weapons.  As you adventure through the game, you find money, ammo, schematics for new weapons and armor, and Power Nodes, which upgrade your weapons and armor.In order to kill a Necromorph, you must sever its limbs and the weapons in Dead Space 2 are designed to do just that.  The surgical Plasma Cutter is back, with the pulse rifle, the line gun, the javelin thrower, the ripper, a long range rifle, the mine launcher, and some new energy weapons.  All of them are upgradeable via weapon slots that resemble skill trees.  By placing a Power Node in the tree, your weapon gets the upgrade.Issac is also equipped with telekinesis so he can hurl objects at enemies and stasis, which slows down enemies for a brief period of time.Because this is a survival horror game, health and ammo are a bit scarce.  All of the weapons are fun to shoot and the enemies pose different kinds of threats.  The strength of the Dead Space series is the enemy vs. weapon match ups.  These enemies pose a challenge and the weapons are specifically designed to take them down.There is no HUD.  Instead, the environment gives you all of the information that you need.  Issac's suit tells you how much health he has.  His guns show how much ammo is left.  The doors have holograms that tell you if they can be opened or unlocked...I know that this is a survival horror game and not a full blown action game, but the combat does feel a bit clunky at times.  Here's why...Who killed me?The camera is in 3rd person and pulled in very close to Issac.  Because of this, it is very difficult to see enemies coming from the sides or enemies on the floor.  Also, killing enemies leaves a corpse behind, and when you leave a pile of corpses, a crawling enemy can attack you before you see it.  The game is very dark, mostly illuminated by Issac's flashlight.  But there are dark enemies that spit acid from a very long distance.  They are incredibly difficult to see and the acid damages your health and slows you down.I'm too slow!Issac turns really slowly.  So slowly, that if you are attacked from the front and 90 degrees to the right at the same time, it is almost impossible to not get grabbed by an enemy, even if you use stasis.  As you take damage, Issac's run speed also slows down.Insta-killedThere are a few areas in the game with traps or interactive cutscenes that kill you if you make a mistake.  This feels dramatic, but it also feels unforgiving.Where'd my Health go?You can quick use a health pack by pushing the B button.  But you use B when you use telekinesis or exit interactive objects in the world.  If you aren't careful, you can accidentally use up all of your health packs.  If you are low on cash, you may not be able to finish the game and you may have to load a previous save.  This has happened to 3 of my friends.  You cannot turn the quick use off.  It would have been better if you had the option to use a health pack in your weapon selection (Press UP on the D-pad).  You also use your strongest Health Packs first, even if you are already at full health.Aside from these (semi-serious) issues, the game is still fun and suspenseful.Levels  9/10The level designs are great.  There is exploration, puzzles, combat, anti-gravity areas, areas without oxygen, traps, etc...  There is a pretty big variety and the levels contribute to a very believable world.Multiplayer: 9/10The Multiplayer is quite good!  It's like an improved version of Left 4 Dead, where teams of 4 Humans take on teams of 4 Necros.  The humans have objectives in the maps and the Necros try to thwart them.  As you play, you gain XP, which allows you to unlock new costumes and weapons.  Humans carry 2 weapons, stasis, and a health pack.  The Necro team continuously spawns and attacks.  There is a cool-down timer based on the enemy that you want to use.  If you want a simple melee grunt, you can spawn in 4 seconds.  If you want a very deadly spitter, it will take you 7 seconds.  After you choose your Necro, you can choose a spawn point on the map and you can see the location of the objectives, allies, and enemies.  Each side takes a turn trying to complete the objectives.Sound: 10/10The music ranges from eerie to exciting.  The sound effects are great at highlighting the action or creating tension and suspense.  It's all very well done.Replay Value: 9/10Play through it once as a survival horror game in 10 hours, then play through it again with your weapon upgrades as an action game in about 5-6 hours.  Then there's the multiplayer.  You will get your money's worth here.There are 5 different difficulty levels, too.Maturity: MatureThe story is a psychological horror / scary creature feature.  It's packed with language and gore.  If your 10 year old played this, expect him to sleep in your bed until he is 15.Overall: 9/10Dead Space 2 improves on the original and adds a fun multiplayer game.  Action, horror, and sci-fi fans will enjoy this game.  The multiplayer is fun, but it's not going to pull you away from Halo or Call of Duty.Buy this game if you love horror and will play through it more than once.Buy this game if you liked Left 4 Dead 2 and want more of that.Rent it if you want to blow through the campaign.  You'll need 8-12 hours depending on the difficulty.Avoid it if you don't like gore.Avoid it if you want a full on epic action game like Halo or Call of Duty.  The controls may feel a bit sluggish and the suspenseful pacing of the game may be a bit slow.If you liked this game, you'll enjoy the Silent Hill series as well as the Left 4 Dead series.

At first I wasn't going to bother reviewing Madden2K1 for PS2 since everyone else has basically voiced the typical opinions.  But, as someone who remembers as far back as Madden '92, I figured I would add some insight in terms of helpful hints on gameplay.RUNNING: So unbelievably diverse.  You have to know WHEN to run, and when NOT to run.  You can't always do some cheap HB pitch to the outside, then outrun a host of chubby linebackers for a 20 yard gain.  You have to keep the defense on their toes with a good mix of running and passing plays.  Don't be afraid to run up the middle.  It works just as well as an outside run, and often better.  If you have a good fullback, don't be afraid to use him.  Deflecting tackles is just as good as outrunning a defender to get yardage.  Use the various peripheral moves like the stiff-arm and the hurdle to foil potential tacklers, because they do work.  And keep in mind that a running back that bolts into the secondary often does so uncovered, so when 3 DBs are crowding Keyshawn, don't be surprised if Warrick Dunn is left alone for some easy yards.  Use motion!  If you are running outside, don't hesitate to put the fullback in motion to that side to obtain an early block, and feel free to do the same with receivers.PASSING: Remember the success of a good short-passing game.  Not every ball has to be a 30+ yard fly route.  Especially if your QB isn't Joe Namath, you might have greater success picking apart a defense with comeback routes and sideline passes.  The opposing pass defense is NOT infallible.  Watch their eyes light up in horror as on 3rd and 1 you audible into a shotgun streak play and your 4 fastest receivers go sprinting into a depleted secondary.  Remember the velocity of the pass.  There is a time to lob and there is a time to bullet.  If you see coverage on a short pass, don't be afraid to put some oomph on the pass to fit it in there.  If you are facing some rather large defensive linemen bearing down on your QB, but your receiver hasn't &quot;gotten there&quot; yet, you will need to lob.  Don't be afraid to go deep with a good receiver.  It might not always work, but be sure to pick the best receiver available when you do.  The ability to cancel a pass whilst scrambling is very useful.  If you drop back to pass and get forced out of the pocket, hit the triangle button to stowe the passing icons and hustle it upfield.  You can always toggle them back on if you find a receiver before you cross the line of scrimmage.DEFENSE: When in the secondary, be extra careful if you are taking control of a defensive back.  It is one of the easiest ways to kill yourself on defense if you quickly switch control to the covering defender, only to screw up and have the receiver outsprint you for a huge gain.  I have given up many a long pass due to incompetance that could have been prevented if I had just let the computer handle the coverage for me.  Don't be a hero!  When on the defensive line, don't forget to utilize the shoulder buttons to get past the opposing line.  It's more effective than just pushing down and hoping the other guy commits an error.  Linebacker is a fun choice to control on defense, but just be wary of that player's coverage responsibilities.  You might find rushing the QB to be a good way to hurry the pass, but when the QB finds an open receiver courtesy of the coverage you failed to put on him, it burns.  As in most football games, concentrate on stopping the pass, because stuffing the run is not that difficult, even in pass coverage formations.KICKING: Don't take field goals for granted!  The field goal kicking in this game can be merciless.  If it's over 40 yards, you really need to make sure you can control your kicker's momentum gauge, or else you will be looking mighty pathetic.  Point-afters are practically automatic, as they should be, and punting is generally not as nerve-wracking as field goal kicking.  Remember to use the field when punting, don't hesitate to aim for the sides of the field.I owned NFL2K1 for DC, and I own Madden2K1 on PS2.  Both are quality games, and you really can't go wrong with either, but I find Madden to be more fulfilling.  The atmosphere is nicer, the rolling stats of the play-calling page along with the post-play TV style presentation are great ways to add to the substance of the game.  The players models look more correct, and less like giant zombies, though faces occasionally look like circus kewpie dolls.  Madden comes off as a deeper game with more substance (let's not forget the Madden Cards.)
At first I wasn't going to bother reviewing Madden2K1 for PS2 since everyone else has basically voiced the typical opinions.  But, as someone who remembers as far back as Madden '92, I figured I would add some insight in terms of helpful hints on gameplay.RUNNING: So unbelievably diverse.  You have to know WHEN to run, and when NOT to run.  You can't always do some cheap HB pitch to the outside, then outrun a host of chubby linebackers for a 20 yard gain.  You have to keep the defense on their toes with a good mix of running and passing plays.  Don't be afraid to run up the middle.  It works just as well as an outside run, and often better.  If you have a good fullback, don't be afraid to use him.  Deflecting tackles is just as good as outrunning a defender to get yardage.  Use the various peripheral moves like the stiff-arm and the hurdle to foil potential tacklers, because they do work.  And keep in mind that a running back that bolts into the secondary often does so uncovered, so when 3 DBs are crowding Keyshawn, don't be surprised if Warrick Dunn is left alone for some easy yards.  Use motion!  If you are running outside, don't hesitate to put the fullback in motion to that side to obtain an early block, and feel free to do the same with receivers.PASSING: Remember the success of a good short-passing game.  Not every ball has to be a 30+ yard fly route.  Especially if your QB isn't Joe Namath, you might have greater success picking apart a defense with comeback routes and sideline passes.  The opposing pass defense is NOT infallible.  Watch their eyes light up in horror as on 3rd and 1 you audible into a shotgun streak play and your 4 fastest receivers go sprinting into a depleted secondary.  Remember the velocity of the pass.  There is a time to lob and there is a time to bullet.  If you see coverage on a short pass, don't be afraid to put some oomph on the pass to fit it in there.  If you are facing some rather large defensive linemen bearing down on your QB, but your receiver hasn't &quot;gotten there&quot; yet, you will need to lob.  Don't be afraid to go deep with a good receiver.  It might not always work, but be sure to pick the best receiver available when you do.  The ability to cancel a pass whilst scrambling is very useful.  If you drop back to pass and get forced out of the pocket, hit the triangle button to stowe the passing icons and hustle it upfield.  You can always toggle them back on if you find a receiver before you cross the line of scrimmage.DEFENSE: When in the secondary, be extra careful if you are taking control of a defensive back.  It is one of the easiest ways to kill yourself on defense if you quickly switch control to the covering defender, only to screw up and have the receiver outsprint you for a huge gain.  I have given up many a long pass due to incompetance that could have been prevented if I had just let the computer handle the coverage for me.  Don't be a hero!  When on the defensive line, don't forget to utilize the shoulder buttons to get past the opposing line.  It's more effective than just pushing down and hoping the other guy commits an error.  Linebacker is a fun choice to control on defense, but just be wary of that player's coverage responsibilities.  You might find rushing the QB to be a good way to hurry the pass, but when the QB finds an open receiver courtesy of the coverage you failed to put on him, it burns.  As in most football games, concentrate on stopping the pass, because stuffing the run is not that difficult, even in pass coverage formations.KICKING: Don't take field goals for granted!  The field goal kicking in this game can be merciless.  If it's over 40 yards, you really need to make sure you can control your kicker's momentum gauge, or else you will be looking mighty pathetic.  Point-afters are practically automatic, as they should be, and punting is generally not as nerve-wracking as field goal kicking.  Remember to use the field when punting, don't hesitate to aim for the sides of the field.I owned NFL2K1 for DC, and I own Madden2K1 on PS2.  Both are quality games, and you really can't go wrong with either, but I find Madden to be more fulfilling.

As I said in the title, this is not a review. I just want to save like-minded people some time, and summarize what makes 2005 different from the 2004 title.  While this isn't platform specific, the biggest upgrade this year is for the Xbox, as EA and Microsoft have finally settled, and online play has finally arrived via XBLive.  I'd like to not assign stars at all, but Amazon doesn't allow for pre-release non-reviews.  So I'm assigning 5 stars based on NCAA 2004, and the promise of the following new features.That aside (despite it being a huge issue), the following changes come directly from EA Sports announcements.  What follows is verifiable on their website or with a few well-placed Google searches.  I present it for convenience.  These 'pre-release reviews' that always pop up for titles might as well serve a real purpose, besides of course the all-important "tHIs gAme iS dEFiNaTEly (sic) gOInG tO RAwK!!!" proclamations.  But I digress, the summary follows, I intend to keep my personal commentary to an absolute minimum;GENERAL GAMEPLAY IMPROVEMENTS:- Big hits:  The option to take a chance on really plastering another player.  Increases the chance of a fumble or dropped pass, but also the chance of you whiffing on the tackle.- Improved run blocking and new run animations:  No more getting stuck against or behind your own linemen.  Good offensive lines now open better holes and routes.- Home Field Advantage:  The bigger the stadium, the louder the crowd, the greater the impact.  Pumping up the crowd carries more meaning and response.  Visiting teams have to fight an uphill battle against the environment, based upon the strength of the home team's stadium and crowd.- Interactive Timeouts: You're now given a choice on which group to coach, it can directly address ratings and composure levels depending on those of your team captains.  You can now "ice the kicker" with timeouts, as composure is an issue for all players.- Match-Up Stick:  Player ratings (in game) can now change based upon the individual's ability to handle pressure.  You can now check composure and mismatches pre-snap.- Custom fans:  Set up your own 'crazed' fans with a variety of options, accessories, appearances, etc.  To add to the college gameday atmosphere, and...- Custom celebrations:  Choose to play a mascot, fan or player animation, decide between mild and extreme.- More "user" stats:  User pick tracking was well received, now more stats are tracked in this form in your record book.DYNASTY MODE IMPROVEMENTS:- Roster expansion to 70 (according to the producer, although 75 has been reported elsewhere).  It's been down at 55 for years, which has been a source of frustration for those who enjoy dynasty mode.- Top 25 Stadiums tracking:  In dynasty mode, you can build home field advantage where there was little or none before, the top 25 places to play are tracked.- Team Captains:  As part of a deeply enhanced dynasty mode, you can now name captains.- Program integrity:  Dynasty depth - keep tabs on your players, you can now suffer academic issues and/or team rule violations.  You choose how to discipline, and you can now actually lose scholarships, television exposure, and post-season play if you don't run a clean program.  It also speaks to;- Player transfers:  You can now lose athletes to transfers if they're unhappy, and feel like they should be seeing the field more.  You can also have players from other programs request a transfer in if you're not deep at their position.- Recruiting pipelines:  You can now build your presence outside of your immediate geographic region.- Improved scouting:  You can now unlock prospect attributes without offering a scholarship first.- Better defined offensive/defensive coaching strategies:  Speaks to play-calling, simulation and recruiting.- Accurate conference schedule rotation.- Athletes:  You can now recruit a kid just for his athletic ability, and define or switch his position on the roster later.  If you have a QB who would make a better FS or WR, you can switch him, and he will progress according to his new position, not the old.- More/improved Sports Illustrated stories, magazine covers and insight throughout the season.- More trophies.  Added support for the Rimington and Doak Walker.  28 bowl trophies, 49 rivalry trophies.- All-Conference teams.  To supplement 1st and 2nd team All-American tracking.ONLINE PLAY IMPROVEMENTS:- Opponent scouting:  They've added a new scouting report that allows you to check any player's (online) tendencies. You can look at their favorite playbook and formation, as well as look at how much they no-huddle, call hot routes, and audible.  It's meant to try and cut down on the number of games wasted to opposition that cheats or otherwise plays in a manner you're not interested in.- Quick tournaments:  4 or 8 player tournaments built right into the online system.- Even team mode:  An option that will allow an even playing field, regardless of the `real world' strengths and weaknesses of two programs/teams.- Improved leaderboards.- Minigames.That's all I've come across so far, but it's a factual aggregation of information, all directly from the source.  Either Electronic Arts, and/or Rod Moye the producer via an interview on EASports.  None of this comes through third parties, or speculation.  Given that, this looks to be one of the biggest leaps forward this franchise has enjoyed in some time.  Particularly for Xbox fans as they finally get online play, but really for everyone.  But enough, I now return you to your regularly scheduled, "tHiS gAMe iz dA bOMb!" 'reviews'.

I'm not going to cover what's already been covered several times in other reviews.  But I will say that to make this game complete you really need NCAA Football 2005.  Why?  After you finish a season in Madden 2005 the Xbox generates names and stats automatically.  Wouldn't it be more realistic if those stats were earned?  Buy NCAA Football 2005, play a season, import the roster and draft players with real stats at the end of a season on Madden 2005.  Repeate after every season you play. Now of course I realize that none of this is real, but I just somehow feel better drafting players that earn their stats instead of letting the Xbox create them.  In NCAA Football 2005 your players start nameless, but when you recruit after the season your new players will have names.  When they complete their college career, you can change their names.  What I did is I took my senior class and drafted some of them -- I couldn't get all I wanted -- and named them Richie Cunningham, Ralph Malph, Arthur Fonzerilli, and Potsie Webber.  That way when I see them on the field the backs of their jerseys will have a name instead of FB#5.  ESPN NFL 2K5 can't compete with this game.  I feel sorry for all your suckers that bought that stinker and think you are stupid for denying that Madden 2005 is better.

as far as the gameplay goes nothing has really changed in that the computer still gains 430 total yards despite only managing 6 plays of consequence (typically three passing plays of 45, 75 and your everyday 90 yarder on 3rd and 27, with three running plays of 30, 70 and 80). the other 40 comes from the other 50 plays. lovely. but i guess that adds to the charm but it doesn't bother me so much for i just adore the general manager format. forming depth charts, lowballing classy veterans and monopolizing the first four picks in the draft are things that i've always fancied. now, i can take whichever franchise i choose and move them to Montr&eacute;al. a serious problem with the game though is that when i want to do a fantasy draft, there are teams that either end up with two top qb's or rb's. for example, the chargers had peyton manning and chad pennington while the broncos selected ladanian tomlinson and shaun alexander.

I have played the Chinese against the UN. I have, at my whim, subverted Venezuelan revolutionaries, kidnapped and executed executives, run tanks through VZ government palaces and exploded oil platforms. I have launched missiles at reinforced bunkers, chased gunboats through minefields, and dropped shipping containers on the heads of civilians from black helicopters. I have hijacked troop transports, destroyed historic castles and run guns for Jamaican pirates. I have blownup billboards with rocket launchers and run missile gunships aground. I have thrown more grenades and flipped more jeeps than I can count. I have stolen millions of dollars, sabotaged fuel depots, tasked satellites over refineries and dropped the mother of all bombs on a hillside favela. I have dealt with money grubbing gringo mercenaries, ball busting female insurgents, Rastafarian bird smugglers, pierced Irish playboys, ambitious Chinese colonels and drunken Russian pilots. I have swung from helicopter skids and thrown men to their deaths 3000 feet above the jungle floor. I have snuck through government checkpoints in rustbucket heaps armed with only a sidearm. I have called in carpet bombing airstrikes on UN peacekeepers. I have rained artillery fire on office buildings in the middle of business districts and watched them crumble in huge clouds of concrete dust while chomping a cigar. I have pistol whipped dignitaries and handcuffed them only to execute them because I have double crossed the clients who already paid my bounty. I have run armored personnel carriers through tarpaper shacks and demolished military barracks with C4. I have crawled out from under the wreckage of helicopters falling from the sky, victims of combat air patrols. I have dropped fuel air devices, cluster bombs and even a nuclear bunker buster that I extorted from an American general just to get revenge.I am the danger.

Lately, I find my gaming collection containing more EA Games software than any other brand!Battlefield 1942 is a wonderful WW2 simulation. You can play on either the Axis or the Allied teams! Different missions represent different countries from these two sides, and each country has their own, unique weapons! You can choose to be a scout (sniper rifle/handgun/grenades), an assault soldier (assault rifle/handgun/grenades), an anti-tank soldier (anti tank rockets/handgun/grenades), a medic (short range, fast shooting carbine/handgun/grenades/ability to heal), or an engineer (single shot rifle, open sights/handgun/demolition bombs/anti-tank mines/ability to repair vehicles). There are enough maps here to keep you busy for a very, very long time! I got the game about 6 months ago, along with the Secret Weapons and Road to Rome expansion packs, and I still haven't stopped playing!Fight on land using your basic weapons, or drive a tank/APC/Jeep/artillery vehicle! You can even pick up your dead buddy's or enemy's weapon configurations! Planes dive bombing you and your buddies? Jump into the seat of an anti-aircraft cannon! Aircraft carriers or battleships giving you grief? Grab ahold of those fixed artillery cannon controls and lob some high-caliber, high-impact rounds their way! You sunk my battleship! :)Fighting on land not your style? Take to the skies in fighter planes and bombers! Most games that combine air/sea/land combat focus more on the land combat, and tend to have horrible air physics! (For example, Operation Flashpoint -- which is another great game, though the air fighting is lacking greatly) Not BF1942, though. The air fighting is almost as realistic as some WWII flying games like European Airwar! The Secret Weapons expansion pack adds a few new, futuristic aircraft such as something resembling a stealth bomber, and some &quot;midget&quot; rocket-fueled fighter planes.This game also provides you with some sea combat options. Some missions give you aircraft carriers to launch your air attacks from. Some give you battleships with massive artillery cannons! Some missions require you to start on one of these ships, and blaze toward land in .50 machine gun wielding personnel carrier boats!All in all, this is an excellent game. I ran it previously on a 1 ghz AMD Athlon w/ 256 mb of ram and a GeForce 5600 256mb graphics card with a Logitech Wingman Force FBK USB joystick under Windows 98 2nd Ed. Using this set up, I was able to run it on 1024x768x16 graphics mode at medium-high detail with no problem. Now, I run it on a Pentium 4  2.8ghz 800mhz FSB processor w/ 1 gig of dual channel DDR400 memory and the same 256 mb GeForce5600 graphics card, on a 21&quot; monitor under Windows XP. I am now able to run 1600x1200x32 resolution @ 80hz refresh rate (when you run this game under XP, it lets you choose the refresh rate you want to use!) and absolute full, maximum detail, and the game doesn't even bog the computer down in the slightest at these outrageous settings!The graphics in the game are excellent, you can even get up close and look at the characters, and they have unique faces! The game play is excellent, I haven't found any noticable bugs or errors! The boats handle like boats, the tanks handle like tanks, the aircraft handle like aircraft, and the firearms handle as close to real life as possible (coming from one who has collected over 35 firearms including A-Bolt .308 sniper rifle, 7.62x39mm AK-47, .223 AR-15, .45 1911 handgun, and many more!). The firearms even have kick that throws off your aim like in real life! The in-game audio gets a four out of five rating. It is quite realistic, but could have been made better with the use of THX or a similiar audio standard. Listen to bombs falling right at you from planes, and try to outrun them, if you can! Explosions all around you, .50 machine guns whizzing hundreds of rounds per minute past your head, your buddies screaming out with their last breath as they pass on from this world.... EXCELLENT realism! You and your men even speak in their native tongue, with english subtitles! The maps are quite large, as well, and give you plenty of freedom in your attack movements. The AI is great as well. I never feel like I am being cheated! The AI suffers from the same advantages/disadvantages as you, they even have to stop and reload, or run out of ammunition, just like you do!While the idea behind all the maps is the same (checkpoint control), there are several types of checkpoint control offered. Assault maps give you fast-paced, in-your-face combat action that's not for the light hearted! Dive in and out of buildings and behind debris and other objects as you are rained upon by tank mortars and a hail of gunfire. Conquest maps tend to be much larger, and require a little less immediate tact, but put more emphasis on using stealth, concealment, and a well thought out path of attack to achieve your goals.If you are into war simulators as much as I am, then this is a must have game! It deserves every bit of the 5 star rating I gave it. Battlefield Vietnam is even better, providing modern weaponry and improved fighting physics/terrain, but I haven't played it long enough to go write a review on it! Enjoy!

Medal of Honor: Frontline begins with the powerful words of Dwight D. Eisenhower's famous Order of the Day for June 6th, 1944, in which he both encouraged and warned the Allied Expeditionary Force of the dangers that lay ahead.  It also has actual WWII footage, which I watch over and over again.When you hit "New Game" you are immediatley thrown onto Omaha Beach and survive a hit by a German 88 shell that lands in your LCVP. I'm assuming you're with the 2nd or 5th Rangers on the D-Day level, because instead of crouching behind the seawall, confused and leaderless like the 116th was that day, you go clearing up an exit like the real Rangers did.  After D-Day, you are reassigned to the Office of Strategic Services and become an operative sent to sabotage a U-boat installation.  Throughout the rest of the game, you are thrown in the middle real WWII events, like Operation Market Garden, where you cross the Nijmegen Bridge before the 82nd Airborne, and help out the British Airborne at Arnhem in Holland.  You also have to foil Nazi plans for a flying wing jet fighter, which in real life never made it to active duty.It seemed like the purpose of this game was more to show you World War II in a PG-rated style, which I enjoyed, except for the PG part.  No blood, no gore (not that it's good when it's falling out of people).  Just flashes and guys falling over and fading away.  I guess that's one thing that bugged me.  WWII was such a horrible war because it was an incredibly messy war.  The bodies and blood didn't just fade away at Omaha, Utah, Sword, Juno, or Gold beaches.  They didn't fade away in the Normandy hedgerows.  Nor at Arnhem, Iwo Jima, or Okinawa.  I guess this game wasn't violent enough, not that violence is good, but if you're trying to recreate World War II, you can make it a wee bit messier.I love the graphics in this game.  While they do sometimes screw up, they are still wonderful.  You may notice that this game looks familiar because it looks like many World War II movies, especially Saving Private Ryan (the beach on the D-Day level and the town in the mission "Seaside Stowaway") and A Bridge Too Far (the Operation Market Garden level titled "Several Bridges Too Far").  Both movies accurately recreated the battles they portrayed (a Bridge Too Far was shot on actual battlefield locations), and so did this game (except for the lack of "mess").I also liked the fact that you could use real WWII weapons like the B.A.R., Walther P38, Panzerfaust. Of course, who would be stupid enough to make a WWII-era game without WWII era-weapons?One of the problems was this game was unreasonably easy (even on Hard), especially since you have a health meter.  One man couldn't take on the entire German army.  But then, that just convinces me further that this game was to show you WWII PG-style.Another big problem I had with this game was that it portrayed all the German soldiers as fierce, evil Nazis. In real life, many of the German soldiers weren't German. Many were in Ost battalions (POWs captured by the Germans on the Eastern Front), forced to fight against their will (German NCOs often had them at gunpoint) and scared to death.Overall, this is a pretty good WWII game, realistic in a PG way.  Can't wait until the next one comes out.

I recently purchased this highly anticipated title, and folks, I wasn't dissapointed. From all the commercials, it seems as if this game is a cut-scene filled artistic masterpiece. Add plenty of explosions, gun shots, and WWII combat, subtract cut-scene filled, and retain masterpiece, and the equation solves itself. This game is one title that will be in my collection for a long time.The game starts out in a WWII D-day Higgins Boat, as you are one of nine soldiers in the boat approaching likely death at Omaha Beach. Included in the boat are men praying, men throwing-up, and the heroic captain who leads the squad. To the left, a German fighter flys towards you, as the boat's navigator screams, "Bandit, nine-o-clock, heads down!" Then the fighter starts firing its .50 caliber machine gun, and destroys the boat next to you in a firey explosion. The navigator screams, "30 seconds!"Then the captain in the front turns around and gives helpful advice to his men; "10 seconds!" Once the ramp drops, an artilery burst blows everyone out of the boat and into the water. While underwater, you see men being strangled by their own weapons, men being shot in a stream of bubbles, and men who are already dead; then you rise from the water (all of this takes place within about 90 seconds).Machine guns are blazing, the sound of bullet impact floods the air, and you've got a desperate captain yelling at you to get to his position (sounds like Saving Private Ryan, huh. Take away the blood, gore, and explicit language, and it is).This mission is one of 19 levels in the game, ranging from all out combat, to stealth infiltration. This game is a must-have for all 1st person shooter fans. But be warned: it is a little short (15 hours). But if you overlook that, then you'll be extremely pleased.

This game is Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2005 by EA Sports. It has many different options. It is much better then the other golf game i had Tiger Wooda PGA Tour 2002 (see my review). When you enter the main menu you have to pass three parts of a tutorial. Then you can start playing. You know how you could take advantage in early games and spin the ball directly to the hole? Well, early in the game, you go through tour difficulty and can't spin the ball any more. Gameface is back and better than ever. Golfers include Adam Scott, Tiger Woods, Sunday Tiger Woods, Ricky Barnes, Natlie Gulbis , # 1 golfer in the world Vijay singh, and Stuart Appleby. Courses include Couer D' Alene, Coloniel CC (the course where Annoka Sourenstam missed the cut at in a PGA Tour event), Pebble Beach, St. Andrews, and TPC at Sawgrass. Announcing includes Gary McCord. Also in this game are l;egens such as Arnold Palmer, Seve Balleseros, Gary Player, and Ben Hogan. This game is rated E for everyone. My favorite mode is matchplay, when you win a hole you can take away any of your opponent's clubs (except for the putter) or bring back one of your clubs that was taken away from you. Aother modes are stableford scoring system tournament, better ball  alternate shot, and four somes. Four problems though. There is no Phil Mickelson. No Ernie Els. No Whistling Straits (home of the 2004 U.S open). Finally, no president's cup. There is new Tiger Vision which during a round of golf when you reach the green, you get three looks at putts no matter where they are. This means you are garenteed to make the putt. Have fun and enjoy gaming.

Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2005 is a nice follow-up to the 2004 version.  For those of you who are unfamiliar with the title, here is a brief summary:Create your own golfer and take him from the ranks of the amateurs to the PGA tour, or play as one of several PGA Tour personalities included in the game, including up-and-coming youngsters Adam Scott, Charles Howell III, battle-hardened veterans like Colin Montgomery and Jesper Parnevik, multiple major winners Vijay Singh and Retief Goosen, LPGA hottie Natalie Gulbis, friend of Tiger Notah Begay III, and the man himself, Tiger Woods.  Play on close to a dozen real courses (Pebble Beach, TPC at Sawgrass, Harbortown, etc.) and two fantasy courses.Here's where 2005 improves on 2004:1.  More licensed equipment and clothing2.  More detailed character construction ("Game Face")3.  Sharper graphics4.  Legends Tour, where one can climb the ranks to challenge all-time studs Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Ben Hogan, and Gary Player, as well as Seve Ballesteros and new legend Tiger Woods.Here's where 2004 is better:1.  More well-known courses (Plantation course at Kapalua, Princeville, Poppy Hills, Spyglass, Sahalee, Coeur d'Alene, Bethpage Black, TPC at Avenel, etc.).2.  Driving range for practice.3.  Less-buggy.I found one particularly irritating bug -When I was playing against any legend on any course that was comprised of a compilation of holes from the included courses, there was one hole from St. Andrews (Old Course) in which the computer player would tee off on the par 4 with a lob wedge!  Then, they'd putt about 20 feet.  So, basically, I would tee off, hit the ball 275+ yards, and pretty much be up a stroke right off the bat.Another irritating bug -The commentary doesn't match the situation or outcome.  For example, I'll hit an approach shot from 200+ yards away to within 8 feet of the cup, and David Feherety's voice will say something like, "That's not the worst shot in the world, but its not the best, either."  Or, you could make a putt, and he'd say, "That's going to be way short," right when the ball drops into the cup.  There are other silly mismatched comments, too.The game ran well on my terrible MSI GeForce FX 5600XT 128MB video card, but I did run into a little lag from time to time.  I upgraded to an ATI Radeon 9800 Pro, and I can pretty much play the game at the highest quality levels now.  I also tried the game on my same computer (P4 2.8c, 1 Gig of Corsair XMS RAM) with an ATI Radeon 9550 card, and it ran extremely well.  Both Radeon cards were big time upgrades over the GeForce FX 5600XT.Although 2005's courses aren't as great as 2004's, you can load 2004's courses into 2005, although they won't be available for tournament play, but you can still play matches on them.  Check out any of the Tiger Woods PGA Tour forums online for more information on how to play 2004 courses in the 2005 game.This is a really fun golf game with terrific graphics.  I found the improved graphics, better "game face," and more licensed equipment a worthwhile reason for purchasing TW2005 even though I also own TW2004.  I really don't think there is any other golf game out there that can match TW2005.  MAKE SURE you have a PC and Video Card that MORE than meets the minimum requirements if you want to see graphics that will make you drool.  I've seen what TW2004 looked like on a PC with only 16MB of Video RAM (the minimum system requirements) and a P4 2.0Ghz, and it wasn't pretty!
Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2005 is a nice follow-up to the 2004 version.  For those of you who are unfamiliar with the title, here is a brief summary:Create your own golfer and take him from the ranks of the amateurs to the PGA tour, or play as one of several PGA Tour personalities included in the game, including up-and-coming youngsters Adam Scott, Charles Howell III, battle-hardened veterans like Colin Montgomery and Jesper Parnevik, multiple major winners Vijay Singh and Retief Goosen, LPGA hottie Natalie Gulbis, friend of Tiger Notah Begay III, and the man himself, Tiger Woods.  Play on close to a dozen real courses (Pebble Beach, TPC at Sawgrass, Harbortown, etc.) and two fantasy courses.Here's where 2005 improves on 2004:1.  More licensed equipment and clothing2.  More detailed character construction ("Game Face")3.  Sharper graphics4.  Legends Tour, where one can climb the ranks to challenge all-time studs Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Ben Hogan, and Gary Player, as well as Seve Ballesteros and new legend Tiger Woods.Here's where 2004 is better:1.  More well-known courses (Plantation course at Kapalua, Princeville, Poppy Hills, Spyglass, Sahalee, Coeur d'Alene, Bethpage Black, TPC at Avenel, etc.).2.  Driving range for practice.3.  Less-buggy.I found one particularly irritating bug -When I was playing against any legend on any course that was comprised of a compilation of holes from the included courses, there was one hole from St. Andrews (Old Course) in which the computer player would tee off on the par 4 with a lob wedge!  Then, they'd putt about 20 feet.  So, basically, I would tee off, hit the ball 275+ yards, and pretty much be up a stroke right off the bat.Another irritating bug -The commentary doesn't match the situation or outcome.  For example, I'll hit an approach shot from 200+ yards away to within 8 feet of the cup, and David Feherety's voice will say something like, "That's not the worst shot in the world, but its not the best, either."  Or, you could make a putt, and he'd say, "That's going to be way short," right when the ball drops into the cup.  There are other silly mismatched comments, too.The game ran well on my terrible MSI GeForce FX 5600XT 128MB video card, but I did run into a little lag from time to time.  I upgraded to an ATI Radeon 9800 Pro, and I can pretty much play the game at the highest quality levels now.  I also tried the game on my same computer (P4 2.8c, 1 Gig of Corsair XMS RAM) with an ATI Radeon 9550 card, and it ran extremely well.

Here's my initial impressions of Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10 for the Wii with motion plus.....I have to say I had really high hopes for this years Tiger Woods game because of the M+, and it honestly has surpassed all of my expectations.This is is MUST BUY for all Wii Owners, and the version to purchase for all multi console owners.TW10 is without a doubt the best golf game I have ever played. M+ makes it very realistic & completely immersive.M+ perfectly reads what you are doing. Take putting for example. For the first time in a TW Wii game putting works just like real life. My first putt, I swung a bit harder than you would in "real life", and my ball shot across the green. It very accurately tracks whether you are taking a long or short putt. You can either look at the onscreen meter, or just swing like you would in real life. Follow through really matters too. The aiming with the M+ is perfect, the worst feature of last years Tiger is now perfectly executed. 2009 putting is still available (not like you would WANT to use it), but with motion plus, just select precision putting instead of standard and you will be amazed.The swing mechanic? Wow. Taking a shot feels, well....natural. M+ works so much better than any of the previous versions, the accuracy is almost scary. When driving, the harder you swing, the farther the ball goes. Hit at 50% power with a slight fade, that's what you get. Power swing with a draw?  You actually having to worry about both your backswing and power/follow through in a golf video game. And if you don't know how to do those things in real life, the tutorial is concise and explains the basics of it all in few short (2 minute) lessons.Motion+ makes the gameplay jump lightyears beyond any other golf game ever made. The gameplay certainly leaves the more visually stimulating versions(PS360PC) far behind.The weather on the course you are playing is based on real time weather at the actual course location, which TW checks from the Wii's weather channel.And the amount of content in this game boggles the mind. Most content packed Tiger Woods game ever.Included are almost every golf related activity you could imagine, this will keep you busy for a LONG time.Online Modes include:*Online play: both simultaneous play & real time tournaments, daily and weekly.Traditional Modes include:*Quick Play*PGA Tour*Fed-X Cup*Tournament Challenge (play against some of the toughest challenges in golf history)*Stroke Play*Match Play*Bloodsome*Greensome*Skins*Stableford*Alternate Shot*Best Ball*Four BallArcade Modes Include:*Disc Golf (available for ALL 27 courses)*Rings*Elimination Mode*One-Ball*Team One-Ball*Battle GolfMini Games*Mini Putt (Putt Putt)*Target*T-I-G-E-R*Capture the Flag*Target2TargetI have only tried the disc golf, but it really shows off the M+. I tried throwing it traditionally, straight up, straight down, backhand and I have to say it works very well. Lots of fun. Gets me excited for Wii Sports Resort!!2 other points of interest:There will be downloadable content in the future.If you are playing local multiplayer, you can play with a "Pass the Wii remote" mode until you get more M+ attachments.I highly recommend it to anybody looking for a good golf game. It's brilliant.The 27 included courses:New for 10:1. Banff Springs ( Stanley Thompson 18 )2. Bethpage ( Black )3. Hazeltine National C.C.4. Oakmont C.C.5. Pinehurst ( Course #2 )6. Torrey Pines G.C.

&quot;Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003&quot; is another great title that's a part of the Nintendo GameCube library (although not exclusively).  Prior to getting this game, the only types of video golf I had played were a mini-putt game online and the barroom staple, &quot;Golden Tee&quot;.  This game far exceeds and of those and probably most other golf games as well.  It's very easy to make a sporting video game unpleasant to play (see the Acclaim series of baseball games for example).  The game can be too simply, thereby removing any significant challenge for the user.  Or, the game can be made too complex, causing the user to get frustrated and not want to take the time and effort to learn how to play the game (once again, the Acclaim baseball games suffer this fate).  The key is striking a balance between challenge and simplicity.  &quot;...PGA Tour 2003&quot; succeeds here because goes for simplicity in the basic mechanics of the golf and putt swings, but employs challenges it the form of weather conditions, course setup, skill of opposing golfer, etc.  If the mere mechanics of the swing were so complex that it would take a physically gifted athlete to master them, then the user would not play this game.  However, since the challenge exists in the other variables, the user can get comfortable with the mechanics and then can go about figuring out how to beat the courses and other golfers.&quot;...PGA Tour 2003&quot; employs spectacular graphics as it takes the user all over the world to some of the most famous golf courses in existence.  Pebble Beach, St. Andrews, and Royal Birkdale are just a few of the courses that are available for play.  Most of the courses are locked and it takes winning certain amounts of money and success in the 'Tiger Challenge' to unlock them (in addition to new equipment and golfers).  The graphics make it seem like you are standing at the tees of each of these courses.  Sunlight, cloud cover, rain, fans, rodents running across the fairway all make for an enhancement experience.  The features on the golfing opponents are quite lifelike, too.  From known golfers to fictional ones, &quot;...PGA Tour&quot; creates very real opponents (the female golfers they come up with are pretty sweet, too *wink* *wink*).The real 'ace-in-the-hole' for this game is the 'Tiger Challenge'.  In this format, you get to face off in individual match play format against a number of golfers as you earn higher rankings on the tour and more money.  Most of these matches are, indeed, 9- or 18-hole match play matches.  However, there are other matches thrown in for variety.  There are 'Skins' games matches where golfers you have already defeated challenge you again in a four-person battle for money.  There are also tournament matches that allow you to achieve certain goals and even more money.  Unlike match play, though, you are not required to win these variations in order to move on to the next opponent.  It's just something fun to engage in.  The 'Tiger Challenge' offers a lot in terms of...well...challenge.  Some of these opponents will be quite difficult to defeat, so strategy becomes as much a part of the games as long drives and short putts.  It took me more than 20 tries to defeat 'Mulligan' McGregor and more than 40 tries to defeat Brad Faxon, but the knowledge I developed in learning how to master specific course, weather conditions, and hole-by-hole scenarios outweighed the frustration of playing them multiple times and will actually provide me with strategic planning the next time I play golf for real.In addition to the numerous courses to be played and the 'Tiger Challenge', there are many other features in this game.  There is a 'skillzone' mode where you can practice your accuracy, a 'speed golf' mode that puts a different spin on playing through, and various match, stroke, skins, and tournament modes that can provide a different approach to playing the game.  On top of these, there are a number of rewards that the user can go after.  There are 'scenario medals' where the user is presented with any one of 53 different situations and his or her performance will determine if they get a gold, silver, or bronze medal or any at all.  There are also 'trophy balls' awarded for any number of accomplishments like a bogey-free round, a double eagle, all fairways hit in regulation, and a hole-in-one to name a few.  There is a lot of money to be earned when any one of these 'trophy balls' is earned and it will allow the user to improve their game by buying more attributes for their golfer.It's hard to think of what else there is to add to the superlatives already heaped on this game.  Yet, I do not think it would be hyperbole to say that may be one of the best video sporting games I have ever played.

If you want a innovative baseball expierence, then you must get MVP Baseball 2004. Ever since EA Sports changed Triple Play to MVP Baseball in 2003, it has been one of the top sellers in the baseball category.First off, MVP Baseball's hitting feature is 5 stars. It's like the right thumbstick is a bat. If you point the stick up, you will hit either a pop fly or if you have someone like Vladimir Guerrero, you will hit a homerun. If you point the stick down, you will hit a grounder.Pitching is also genius. You have the pitching meter, so if you choose to have a power up pitch, your pointer on the meter will go into the red zone. The harder the pitch, the harder it is to get into the green zone, which is accuracy. So if you need to be accurate, you may want to take some off your pitch.Graphics are the best in any MLB game. `Nuff said.But in a great game there is always bad stuff. I was pitching mike stanton for the Mets with 24 stamina and it was very simple to put your pitches anywhere. Once you get the hang of the pitching meter, it is very easy to throw difficult pitches. Also, if a fast runner, or even medium speed runner, hits a gapper, he will get an easy triple and even maybe an inside the park homerun. It always seems your chasing those long fly balls.But aside from that, the amount of extras are impeccable. There are retro jerseysfrom every team and 50 old school players. They have players like Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Jackie Robinson. Clearly, MVP Baseball is the best MLB game of our time, period!

Tiger Woods still leads the pack in golfing SIMS for PlayStation and XBox. Still a great game, lots of fun, decent graphics, and more importantly - still a challenge. I gave '04 and '05 both 5-star reviews... '06 is close at 4.5 stars... as is this '07 at 4.5 stars. Each year, there's not a game I look more forward to coming out than Tiger Woods' golf game. Here's the breakdown as I see it on Tiger Woods PGA 2007.GOLF COURSES: 21 total courses (7 new courses). New courses include Aviara (California), The Falls (Las Vegas), The K Club (Ireland), Kiawah Island (Hawaii), The National (Australia), The Riviera CC (California) and The Safari (fictional). Several of the classic courses are back on '07 - including Pebble Beach, TPC at Sawgrass, Harbor Town, Pumpkin Ridge, St Andrews, etc... as well as the Central Park course and The Predator. There are 15 PGA players to unlock. The commentator team of McCord and Feherty are back (though many of their phrases are the same from '05 and '06).GAME FACE, EQUIPMENT, GAME MODES: I see no noticeable improvement in the graphics department moving from '06 to the '07 game. Perhaps the PS2 has peaked in the graphics area - and the real improvements are reserved for PS3. Gone are the old timers (Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, etc) that the '06 featured. All the things you could do in '05 and '06 with the face and body are here, however you're only given one head to alter (and a lot of the altering is with the analog sticks instead of scrolling up and down, so it's not as precise). Gone is the "Game Breaker Meter" and "Voice" of the player (both from '06). Clothing, club selection and the misc golf gear is extensive and all the top major golfing brands are here (Callaway, Ping, Taylor-Made, etc). Game modes include the standards: PGA Tour/Season, Traditional (8 games including Match/Skins/etc), Battle Golf, Real Time Event Calendar, Skills 18, and new in '07 - Team Tour, One Ball, Team One Ball, Elimination Mode, and several new games under the 'traditional' category including Bloodsome, Greensome, Stableford, Best Ball and Four Ball. For me, the new game of "One Ball" is/was the best addition - a strategic game where multiple gamers playing a single ball, and each shot must land within a circle whose radius is half the distance to the pin and where holing out scores the most points. As in '06, there is a "Save Progress" button allowing you to stop play at any given time.PUTTING: New in '07 - you get to choose - do you want to put like the '06 game is set up, or like the '05 game (too bad - no caddy tips)? As in '06, you'll need to read the greens and judge the distance to the cup before each putt. You'll need to look at all the info on the screen when putting - grid with sloping beads, camera angles, distance from the cup, and strength of shot. When putting, press the "X" button to show the ideal line/path to the hole. You'll have to judge how far left or right to move the blue arrow. Like the swing control of all your other clubs, you'll need to determine the power of your putts by how far you pull back on your putter. I actually prefer the newer way of putting (from '06) and I've gotten used to it...in my opinion, there's more info on the screen for you to make better putts using this method.SWING CONTROLS: Same as 2006 - your left analog stick still controls the back swing and downswing, as well as your hook and slice; while the right analog stick determines where the club hits the ball. If you don't use the right analog stick (which will be a majority of your shots), you'll hit in the middle of the ball. I feel the right analog stick is more for those strategic shots when you're close to a tree and you need extra loft to get over it, or you're under a tree and you need to punch a line drive to get out from underneath. It's virtually impossible to hit a strategic shot like this with both thumbs on the analog controls AND power up on the L1 button for a stronger shot. You can still choose how you want to hit the ball (full swing, punch, pitch, flop, chip and putt). One nice thing I've noticed - in previous years the game would decide if and when you could use your putter. In '06 as well as '07, you make the choice where to use your putter... even from several feet off the green.SKILL TOKENS: Same as 2006 - gone are the days of earning cash from tournaments and buying literally whatever attributes you want. When you hit a good shot, you will earn skill token(s) for that type of shot. There are 6 categories in which to earn tokens for and improve your golfers performance: General, Power, Accuracy, Putting, Spin, and Concentration. Wagering $$$ - while playing against another player, you can increase your paycheck each time you play, you can wager on every round or even every hole.THE GOOD: Navigating through the screen menus is much easier in '07. The cumbersome and often times frustrating "Clubhouse" from '06 is gone. There are fewer clothing items to choose from (do we really need 150 different shirts?). "Speed Play" quickens the time and you can skip all the post celebrations if you want (with a click of the R1 button). The new games (Team Tour, One Ball, etc) offered are great and I find the game play here is amazingly deep. The new courses are cool - although I must admit I was hoping "The National" course was the one on eastern Long Island (NY), not the one from Australia. '07 includes tutorials - a description and example of each shot and type of game (i.e. flop, punch, pitch, spin control, "Bloodsome", Skills 18, etc)... great for novices of the sport. The EA Sports Trax (music) has changed for the better... it's all fairly low key instrumentals by obscure bands/people (Fort Knox Five, Way Out West, Hexstatic, etc)... gone is the annoying rap and hip-hop from previous years.THE BAD: The announcers' dialogue was often wrong - "Finishes at even par today" when I'm on the 6th hole? "That's just a bad shot" when I leave a shot 4 feet from the pin from 150 yards out? I found the announcers chatter extremely repetitive and frequently turn them off. No big changes in the graphics from '06. All the characters still have a stiff neck. On the '07 game, when you change clothes or clubs, you need to change and adjust the attributes that go with it (this was new on the '06 game) - you need to do this in order to get the best performance from your player. I (still) found this to be a huge waste of time. Many of the trophy balls you earn are a meager $50 or $100... and they simply don't buy much (a hat maybe?). Between screens prepare to wait 20+ seconds every time while the system "checks for memory card" and then "saves data". Once or twice during an 18-hole match, my ball would be on the fringe of the green - and it gave me a weird angle from across the green (and I could not change it) - making for a very difficult shot. Perhaps the game is getting too easy when my young player at a rating of 70 can beat Vijay Singh (rating of 83) by eight strokes. I really miss the old time golfers (Palmer, Nicklaus, etc) from '06. The booklet that comes with the game is thin at only 10-pages and in black & white only... it only touches on the features... I learned more about the new features while actually IN the game and trying stuff out.OVERALL: There are several changes from '06. Some good, some bad... but, mostly for the better. The few new features and the new golf courses make this a must have for those that like the Tiger Woods PGA series... still the best golf game on the market (4.5 stars).

Sim-ers have always wanted pets. The additions of fish and hamsters were rather unsatisfying (and sometimes lethal) additions. This new expansion packs will allow your sims to have dogs, cats, parrots, turtles and lizards as well.Lots of new social interactions have been added, althought the Sims website has not been specific as to what those are. Your neighborhoods are bigger - 30 lots each which you can zone for commerical or residential use.  Also there are new homes, new parks, a new cafe, new shops and a farmer's market! Your new dog or cat can be brought to these locales and used to interact with your sim neighbors.  Just like in Downtown, time freezes when you're in the community sections.Each neighborhood will include a pet store, where you can choose from 12 different cats (e.g., black cat and siamese cat), 12 different dogs (e.g., dalmatians, beagles, french bulldogs, spaniels, rotweillers, labs, greyhounds, german shepherds to name a few), 2 different birds (lovebirds and parakeets), or buy a turtle, lizard or fish.  The Maxis folks haven't forgotten any of the details of pets, if you buy a male and a female of the same species, they just might have babies, dogs and cats (and dog and cat people) might not get along, and Kitty might take a liking to your bird or fishBeware - your doggies and kitties (but not the other animals) need to be trained and cared for so they don't go to the bathroom in the house or rip us the trash.  Don't worry - Maxis is kind enough to provide a dog trainer if you're feeling lazy. But, your pets are just like a member of your family - they will have needs and skills which can be acquired (through positive and negative reinforcement). Just like people, you have to develop a relationship with them.  And just like your people, they can die of neglect, so be careful!  Dogs and cats will also misbehave and get grumpy if you don't take care of them.  Dogs and cats can also be entered in pet shows with prizes for obedience, tricks and good pet mood.  You can't bring your pets downtown (although you can probably pick up a date in the pet park) but your whole family (including your pet) goes on vacation with you.There's new stuff for your house too - you can can garden! Grow 4 different veggies in your patch (you have to buy seeds), careful gardening will result in a crop which you can sell (at the farmer's market) or store (in your new kitchen pantry). You might appreciate your pets here as you'll need to watch out for rabbits, gophers, mice and, as Maxis says ominously, other "unwelcome animals that come a callin'." (Mice, which your cat can keep away, will join roaches as house pets.) There will be 125 new objects for you and your pets (no details on those yet either), a new decorator set (New Orleans French Quarter), new skins and 5 new career tracks (fashion design, chef, vet, teacher, circus performer).  Among the new objects are new chairs, new tables, new fountains, espresso machine, pastry cart, spiral staircase, and pet-oriented objects like food bowls, catnip, dog beds, treats, squeak toys, doghouses, pet gyms, chew toys, and scratching posts.
Sim-ers have always wanted pets. The additions of fish and hamsters were rather unsatisfying (and sometimes lethal) additions. This new expansion packs will allow your sims to have dogs, cats, parrots, turtles and lizards as well.Lots of new social interactions have been added, althought the Sims website has not been specific as to what those are. Your neighborhoods are bigger - 30 lots each which you can zone for commerical or residential use.  Also there are new homes, new parks, a new cafe, new shops and a farmer's market! Your new dog or cat can be brought to these locales and used to interact with your sim neighbors.  Just like in Downtown, time freezes when you're in the community sections.Each neighborhood will include a pet store, where you can choose from 12 different cats (e.g., black cat and siamese cat), 12 different dogs (e.g., dalmatians, beagles, french bulldogs, spaniels, rotweillers, labs, greyhounds, german shepherds to name a few), 2 different birds (lovebirds and parakeets), or buy a turtle, lizard or fish.  The Maxis folks haven't forgotten any of the details of pets, if you buy a male and a female of the same species, they just might have babies, dogs and cats (and dog and cat people) might not get along, and Kitty might take a liking to your bird or fishBeware - your doggies and kitties (but not the other animals) need to be trained and cared for so they don't go to the bathroom in the house or rip us the trash.  Don't worry - Maxis is kind enough to provide a dog trainer if you're feeling lazy. But, your pets are just like a member of your family - they will have needs and skills which can be acquired (through positive and negative reinforcement). Just like people, you have to develop a relationship with them.  And just like your people, they can die of neglect, so be careful!  Dogs and cats will also misbehave and get grumpy if you don't take care of them.  Dogs and cats can also be entered in pet shows with prizes for obedience, tricks and good pet mood.  You can't bring your pets downtown (although you can probably pick up a date in the pet park) but your whole family (including your pet) goes on vacation with you.There's new stuff for your house too - you can can garden!

The Sims 2: Free Time EP gives you Sim the opportunity to have hobbies.  Sims can now have many interests which include Cuisine, Nature, Music and Dance, Sports, Fitness, Arts and Crafts, and Tinkering plus a few others. You can use older items from the Sims to build Sims interest in their hobbies.  The easel is builds up interst in Arts and Crafts, the telescope increases interest in Science, and the swimming pool increases interest in Fitness.  Sims can "tinker" with the showers, bathtubs and garbage disposals.  It also inclues new items like the car for Tinkering, a pottery wheel and sewing machine for Arts and Crafts, and ballet bar for Music and Dance.  When Sims build up interest (similar to building skill points) they open up different options like the ability to talk about their hobby, read about their hobby, and blog about it.  They can also subscribe to hobby magazines and gain memberships to clubs on secret lots.  When the interest is maxed out Sims get "in the zone" and their needs go down more slowly.  Sims also get a Lifetime aspiration meter and can get a Secondary Aspiration.This EP also includes some much wanted new items for babies and toddlers.  There is a new style of baby furniture items, including a crib with a canopy, and the activity table which toddlers and children can build their mechanical and creativity skill points.  The activity table is my favorite new item included in this EP.The downside to this EP is that it has some problems.  The Sims needs decline much more quickly with this EP.  It's is hard to build up hobby interest when the Sims energy, hunger, and hygiene go down very quickly.  Another issue is that the nannies refuse to use any of the new baby items that came with Free Time.  They won't put the babies in the crib and they won't use the new changing table.  Instead they lay the babies on the floor and change them in the middle of the room, leaving a dirty diaper laying there.  Other people have complained that the EP is incompatible with the kitchen and bath items from the Kitchen and Baths Stuff Pack.  The Sims cannot tinker with the new showers or tubs and they can't get leftovers or make platters with the new fridges.  However, EA games does have a patch on the Sims 2 website that fixes some of these issues. I think this EP is definitely worth getting but it definitely requires the patch.
If you don't have this ep get it.It lets your sim go on vacations and it also has a lot of cool new objects in it.New objects you can now put at your own home include saunas,waterfalls,tents and even a pirate ship.These are all available on the vacation lots but you can also put them on your on.There are a lot more new objects but I won't list them.There is 3 locations to visit.Tikki Beach is my favorite.You can also visit a mountain retreat and a place in the far east.Your sim can now stay in hotels and or buy a vacation home.New interactions include comb for seashells,watch waves,dig for tresure,build sandcastles and more.Your sim can even swim in the ocean and lay on the beach and get a tan or sunburn.There is a new camera that gives your sims the choice to take a picture of themselves or themselves and other sims or to ask another sim to take the picture of them.There is many poses your sim can do by themselves and with other sims.Your sim can even kiss or makeout with their lover or spouse and have another sim take a picture of them doing that.Once your off the vacation you order the photos on the pc.You can get them in a book or individually to hang on the wall or put on the table.Each vacation offers so much to see it's advisable for your sim to book at least 7 days to see it all.Their expensive but this is no problem when you use the motherlode cheat which gives you at least 50,000 dollars everytime you input it.New to this expansionYou can now have a honeymoon at one of the 3 vacation spots.You can get married anywhere in the vacation spots and have the wedding of your dream.New public and private places to wohoo(sims sex).On the campground you can wohoo in tents which counts as a public wohoo.You can wohoo in saunas which counts as private.You can wohoo in hamocks which count as public.You can take up to 8 people with you.You have the option of reserving one hotel room or several for your guest.Tents on campgrounds are free they don't cost anything.You can call for roomservice and they will bring you food to your hotel room.Some of the better hotels have swimming pools,hottubs and restuarents and are beachside.The voodoo doll.If you can fix 3 objects in the witchdoctors house he gives you a voodoo doll.You can use this for curses on other sims or to make them fall in love with you or for freindship.I used this on a sim that didn't like my sim.Her relationship was -1 on the top and I clicked on that sim hit more then do voodoo.I picked romance and instanly she went from -1 to 70 that quick and started making out with my sim.Teleporting you can do this if you complete some kind of goal with the ninja.I haven't done that yet.Pirate Ship This is a huge ship and there is a lot to do on it.There is even a ghost that resides on this ship.Waterfalls.Certain locations have this huge waterfall which you can also put in your own lot.If you add soap to it it chages to lava thou.Bigfoot In the mountain locations you can see bigfoot or even talk to him.If you complete somekind of goal you can ask him to move in with you at your own home lot.You can then control him you can hug him but can't do any romantic interactions with him.New hairstyles Women now have 3 new hairstyles and men have a couple and some new facial hair ones too.I really like the new long hair that they give the women.It makes them even prettier.Jewlery you can now buy it at stores and in create a sim mode you can put it on the sims your creating.Souvineers there is all kind of souvineers and trinkets you can buy.Souvineer racks to keep your collectibles on.These are available in buy mode.New clothes and glasses they actually have new tourist clothes and multicolored sunglasses you can wear.There is so much more you can do in this game but I want list that as I don't have time.After seasons this is the best expansion pack I've ever played.I also recommend seasons,holiday stuff and sims 2 deluxe with nightlife.One last thing make sure your pc has at least 512 megs of ram and that's just the minimum it calls for.I would suggest going to 1gb if you have xp.The minimum for Vista is 1gb.I'd suggest 2 or 3.This game takes up a lot of memory and it can lag if you just have the minumum.The specs are higher for this expansion then they was for the previous ones.
What could be cuter than a Sim dog or Sim cat?  This by far has to be the best out of the expansion packs for The Sims.Not only can your Sim have a cute furry animal friend, they have 50 new jobs in five new career tracks and they can grow a vegetable garden.The Old Town development is nice, and it is free for your Sim to go there.  Sims can go there to socialize with other Sims in the neighborhood, to buy a pet, or sell your vegetables.  The Expansion on the neighborhood is great, now there is more space for creative expression.I like this expansion pack the most but there are a few things that are annoying at best.  I like the dog and cat skins, but there are not enough.  Training the pet is time consuming.  I recommend if you have a Sim buy a cat or dog, only buy one at a time.  There are strays that a Sim can befriend and adopt.  Yet like having the Sims develop friendships with other Sims, this becomes a hassle for the career-minded Sim.  The Vegetable garden is good...you won't have your Sim spending their salary on food and they can make a few extra bucks selling the veggies.  Down side: Like with any real garden, you have your garden pests... growing carrots forget it(unless you trained your Sim cat to be a ruthless bloodthirsty hunter). Tip: Grow beans and tomatoes, they don't have to be replanted once they are harvested.I made the mistake of purchasing this expansion pack before the others(Hot Date, House Party, and Vacation).  Now I didn't know I made this mistake, until after playing with Unleashed for about a week then I decided to buy the Hot Date expansion pack.That is when I found out that I had to install the games in order of their release.  So I had to uninstall Unleashed as well as Deluxe Edition, then reinstall and installing the older expansion pack before Unleashed.  I'm not a computer whiz, so it took me a couple of hours and rereading the installion instructions before I got the game to work again.This expansion pack is a must for the Sims, having the pets adds a new dimension to the Sims everyday life.  You don't have as much control over a Sim dog or cat like you do with the Sim people.  The dogs and cats are run by free will, although you can tell them where to go but you cannot give them actions.  Unless your Sim person is petting them or trying to train them.  It is amusing to see the pets interact with one another, and hiss or growl at their owner.

The Sims 3 Seasons is the expansion pack so many have been waiting for, and it's everything I hoped it would be, and more! Every season is packed with new objects, clothing, interactions and community lots to visit. The changing seasons and the weather give the Sims 3 world a whole new life, and bring back that same magic from years ago, the first time we saw it snow in the Sims 2.After installing this pack, the first thing you'll notice is all the new community lots. A new Festival Grounds will be placed in your town, with many more lots also available to add. There are new homes in addition to the community lots ( several parks and different festival grounds). These new community lots are designed with all the new fun activities for your Sims to try out, for each of the seasons. There are over 100 new items, including things like kissing booths, dance floors, concession stands, eating competitions, photo booths, snowboards half-pipe, snow-cone machines, new grills, face painting and tons of new decorative items like Christmas lights and new building items.With your new seasons, you can also change their length and frequency in the "options" menu. There are 4 seasons and you can set them to be as short as 3 days or as long as 28 days. Each season can be set accordingly. You can also uncheck the box for a particular season, and completely skip that season all together. You now have a temperature and season icon on your Sims main panel, that lets you know the current temperature and how many days until the change in the season. You can chose to have this displayed in either Celsius or Fahrenheit.As the seasons change so do the activities your Sims will be able to participate in. Playing soccer, ice skating, roller skating and yes....even making snowmen are all options for your Sims to partake in.  When your Sims are outside and the temperature is cold, you can even see their breath in the air. And to go along with the new seasons, there's new clothing. The new outfits in this pack are about the only thing there is just a moderate amount of. There is a new tab in the clothing screen where you choose your Sims outfits, for outerwear. All of the sweaters, vests and coats that were already in the clothing options have been moved to this tab, with the addition of a few new coats. There are also new snow pants, a few new bathing suites, gloves, goggles (summer and winter), boots, water shoes, face masks and some new long-johns for sleep ware. While there is a handful of new clothing items, there's not as much as other expansion packs in the past have had, likeThe Sims 3 Supernatural, which was overflowing with new clothing and accessories.However what this pack is lacking in new clothing, it makes up for in so many other ways. The seasons and weather are beautiful. While this pack has all the most well loved aspects from the Sims 2 Seasons pack, there is also a ton of other new and fun content as well. There's so much to do and new surprises around every corner, it will take weeks to explore everything. Whether you want to bob for apples, ice skate in a blizzard or go tanning in a Sims tanning booth to get that perfect summertime glow, you can do it now, with the Sims 3 Seasons.
As I say with all Sims expansion packs so far.. this one is GREAT!  It's a fun addition, full of new stuff, new interactions.. everything your Sim needs to get the apple of his eye to gaze upon him with adoration.With this expansion, you get a downtown area to go to.  The downtown is full of shops and restaurants your Sims can visit to have a good time.  In the shops, you can try on and buy new pajamas or evening wear for your Sim (or his/her date!)!  ANd the coolest thing is that if you buy new PJs, your Sim will be wearing them next time he/she slips in to bed.  :D  Also, buying new clothes for a date reallly impresses them.  Sims are very materialistic creatures.Also in the shops you can buy chocolate, flowers, teddy bears and jewelry and give them to your significant other as a present - which is sure to gain brownie points.  Like I said.. Sims love stuff!  There are also magazine racks where you can buy magazines -&gt; these have the added benefit of helping your Sim gain new interests.  So if your Sim beauty is trying to impress a certain someone with her sports knowledge, reading the magazine can help!You also get your choice of fine restaurants.. anywhere from a greasy diner type to fine dining with mood music courtesy of a pianist.  While eating, there are tons of new interactions - including my favorite: Cuddle!  Plus, while your Sims are cuddling up in a booth they can take it a step farther if they're daring and give their sweetheart a smooch (or maybe an all-out makeout session?).  Just watch out for the old crone...she frowns heavily upon public displays of affection.There are some new items for at home too - including the cream of the crop - a love bed!  Your Sims can have a little fun in the heart-shaped love bed, but beware the consequences (hint hint accidental baby hint hint).This is one of my favorite expansion packs - I always enjoyed the relationship aspect of my Sims.. getting one Sim to fall in love with another.  It's the reason I play the game!  I highly recommend this expansion pack - you won't regret it.  And that nerdy Sim who needs a little boost to his love life will thank you as well!

Your sims are like your second family. Now you can adopt a cute kitten or puppy, or even get budgies, lovebirds, turtles, iguanas and goldfish!There are all sorts of accessories that come with the pets, too. There are different sizes of cages for the birds, a fishbowl of course for the fish. There are lizard cages and turtle cages.For the dogs and cats, there are climbing toys, squeeze toys, food dishes of various sizes, and an assortment of sleeping containers. You can go with the inexpensive curl-up spot to the deluxe canopied princess bed.The birds and reptiles are just bought "as is", but when you buy your puppy or kitten you can choose its gender and from 15 different types. For cats, go from siamese to striped to minx with no tail. For the dogs, you can get 101 dalmatians, or maybe a terrier is more your style? The web also offers many, many other skin types if your favorite breed doesn't come with the software.The pets are GREAT. The cats hunt mice, the dogs learn to sit and stay. You can play with your parakeets, taking them out on your finger. I have 3 parakeets at home and they chirp like wild when the budgies come on the screen! So the sounds are definitely very good.In addition to the pets, this expansion also offers five new careers - education, fashion, circus, culinary and animal care. You can grow food in your garden if you wish, and there are new places to visit in town, including a pet show to show off your new friends.But the highlight of course are the pets. You can't control them - you just interact with them. But the interaction can be quite fun. Before you know it, other neighborhood pets will be wandering by to say hello! A must-have for any Sim lover, it really adds a lot to an already addictive game.

MUNCH'S ODDYSEE is the first game in the Oddysee franchise that I have played.  The first two games in the series were released on Playstation formats, but MUNCH'S ODDYSEE came out on X-Box and was one of the launch games of that system.  I first played this game at a friend's house not long after it came out.  I was fascinated by the amazing graphics and having different characters in the world literally follow the main characters around.  It wasn't until recently, however, that I was able to get the game myself and play it all the way through.MUNCH'S ODDYSEE is the third game in the Oddworld series.  If you're like me and have never played any of the other games in the series, that's okay because there's a movie at the beginning of the game that explains Abe's adventures in the first two games and the connection between Abe's race, the Mudokon's, and Gabe's race, the Gabbits.  Munch is the last living Gabbit, but is captured by the evil Vykkers, a race of creatures bent on domination, consumerism, industrialism, and environmental destruction.  Munch is taken captive and one of the early levels of MUNCH'S ODDYSEE involves helping Munch escape from the Vykker's labs' ship.  Once Abe and Munch meet up, the general storyline of the game involves getting back to the Vykker's Labs ship to rescue the egg crates full of Mudokon young and save the last can of Gabbit eggs in existence.The graphics in the game are amazing.  It feels and looks like you are playing a movie.  This shouldn't come as a surprise because the Oddworld series was originally conceived as a set of films.  However, the company, Oddworld Inhabitants, started making video games instead.  Oddworld Inhabitants has gone back to their original plans and the first Oddworld movie is apparently in production.As for game play, MUNCH'S ODDYSEE is simple enough that even most beginning gamers can play along fairly easily, yet the game has enough challenges to make it interesting enough for life-long gamers.  The game is fun to play and appeals to children and young adults, but has enough humor and oddity to appeal that it appeals to older gamers, too.  Now that I've experienced Oddworld, I'm looking forward to the cinematic tales Oddworld Inhabitants will bring.

I got Ty because it got good reviews even though my brother didn't really like the sound of it.  We brought it home read the manuel, got the plot then tried it.  It was amazing, the awesomest graphics I've seen and easy conrols too.  Your basic storyline, parents imprisoned, didn't know alive, talk to mythical dude then whoosh, you're tossing boomerangs, smimming, racing, finging treasure and even racing on a mutated bull!  The only downside is that on the final boss you have to survive as a remote controled boomering in an enclosed area without hitting anything in a maze of tangled wires and haywire defensive systems, it's hard and long, but worth it.  A good, easygoing game, action packed but with more logic than &quot;go through level you're done&quot; each level has many missions in which you gain thunder gems to power a machine that can locate the talismans you need to save your parents.  Moreover, I think Ty is one of the bestest games I got.

Oddworld first one and a half games were hilarous and innoventive(Because the sequel to Oddworld:Abe's Oddysee dosen't count). The 2.5 game in the series has to be the second best of them all because even though this game tops the first one in every way possible but the sad, sad truth is it's the shortest of them all. Munch and Abe are like made for each other even though they were made that way. The controls are good but the Xbox controller feels like it's from a different world because switching is very awkward at very important parts of the game which thus losing a star from me. If you love comedy games like Earthworm Jim and Earthworm Jim 2, this game is made espically for you.

Odd World Munch's Oddesy is a very underrated Xbox title that is being ignored by Halo loving fools.  This game is the sequal to the ever so loving Odd World series for the Playstation.  This time the story revolves more around Munch.  This poor lil' dude is caught up on the wrong moment at the wrong time.  Soon our hero is caught up with our previous Odd World hero, Abe.  These two guys really make a great duo.  They are the Ratchet and Clank, Jak and Daxter of the Xbox.  The game is superb with storyline and gameply.Oddworld has extreamly awesome gameplay and it's a game that I acctually wanted to beat so I can see what happends to poor Abe and Munch.  The game is sort of repetitive but is overall fun filled action adventure.  The game is chuck full of really memorable levels and battles with enemies.  Once again Abe is able to Possess the baddies and take controll of them.  Poor Munch...Most of the time you'll have to have em' in a weelchair since he only has one foot.  The game is a really great game but it fails at lengh and some gameplay elements.The music is great, visuals are awesome, but the game can end pretty quickly and is pretty repetitive.  There are more then 1 ending that will keep you playing for awhile but you could easily beat it withen a week.  That really doesn't help this Underrated classic but ohwell...Good-Visuals are fantastic and one of the best on the Xbox-Great Gameplay elements-Some really memorable gameplay sequences-Munch and Abe are able to posses things-some endings to get which will last for awhileBad-a bit on the short side-can be repetitive-some parts look exactly like the same levels except new enemies!The ugly-Munch in a weelchair...ewwwwOverall Munch's Oddesy is an underrated Xbox title that no Xbox owner should miss out on(unless there expecting something like Halo then forget it)the visuals are great, fantastic voice acting, great gameply, you can controll the camera which is great but still doesn't help for the repetitive gameplay and some dull levels, and overall is a very enjoyable game and that is why I'm giving it a...4.3 out of 5 stars...Lates
