The quality of Halo 2 the game aside, I direct this review at the quality of of the Limited Collector's Edition as a package for the game.The case itself is a durable metal snap case with a minimalist design featuring the logo and 'Limited Collector's Edition' on the front and a grayscale Master Chief on the back.  This case will surely survive the occasional beatings a lot better than a regular DVD case, but be warned that the outer metal casing is thin and prone to dents.  It is therefor wise to keep it in the provided plastic sheath that superimposes the feature list and legal information on the front and back.The one star off is purely indicative of some of the content present on the second disc's Making Of featurette which is needless and frustratingly distracting from the point of the mini-documentary.  That said, the second disc is a healthy collection of Behind-The-Scenes clips and montages showing the numerous stages of development, from voice-actors in the studio to their early E3 demo.  The second disc is competant as a whole, but nothing standout.Included with the LCE ('Limited Collector's Edition') is a small 4 page pamphlet that highlights some textual exerpts from various characters from the game world.  It serves a little bit of flavor, but nothing more as it does little to expand on the overall plot of Halo.Personally, my favorite inclusion with this LCE is the tweaked instruction manual.  Whereas in the general retail copy of Halo 2, the manual featured Master Chief on the front, the LCE's manual features a random Sangheili Elite.  More than that though, while the manual is mostly identical, all of the flavor text in the original release that instructs the reader from the perspective of the UNSC is changed to reflect the perspective of the Covenant which perfectly mirrors the two sides of the story in Halo 2 where you play as both Master Chief and The Arbiter.  It's the little things like how the pages are purple instead of orange, the control map says 'Active Camo' instead of 'Flashlight', and the opening plot summary changes the noble Master Chief standing straight, standard issue Battle Rifle armed at the ready, to a very different image which features a darker Master Chief highlighted by a red glow and apparently lurking around with a rocket launcher.  The change in flavor text extends to the weapon & vehicle section which features Covenant tech first before insultingly listing off the &#34;primitive implements of war&#34;.  I leave this review with a snippet from the Covenant's description of the Magnum:&#34;Almost laughably weak in most circumstances; however, Human pistol fires metallic projectiles which can be dangerous when fired very accurately.  Often used as last resort by desparate Humans and one of their least threatening devices.&#34;

i bought this product for the metal casing. it wasnt what i expected. its metal, but it was all rusty and it wasnt taken care of very well. i hope that when you get one of your own, its better. the disk itself playes very well though.

Halo returns with even better graphics, characters and terrain.Explore even more landscapes, hunt down Prophets (leaders of the Covenant) and master any weapon that is put before you.I was very much pleased with Halo 2. The graphics are better than Halo 1! More weapons mean more things you can wield and use against the enemy.Hop in awesome vehicles such as the Scorpion (a heavily armed tank) the Warthog (a unique vehicle that can carry a machine gun or blaster cannon), the Wraith, (the Covenants'  tank), the Ghost, (a very effective speeder) and more. There are too many vehicles to name that you can drive/fly.Another plus to this game: You can now be a Covenant Elite, the Sangheili! A humiliated ranking officer that was stripped of his rank and made to go on a mission to kill the parasite (creepy looking guys), but he learns that the Covenants `Great Journey' is a lie, and starts civil war within the Covenant. Long story, so I'll let you discover new weapons, vehicles, characters, twist and turns and more in this game as you fight for your life!Cheats--The Needler is an awesome weapon, if you hold down the trigger, many needlers will fly towards the enemy, and if you fire enough, they will explode on impact.If you hold the Plasma Pistol down, it will form a powerful plasma `bullet'.The Lekgolo (BIG, porcupine looking guys) are extremely tough foes, but there is a weak spot to them! Their one (and only) weak spot is their mid-sectiont! It glows from their side to their back, a sniper bullet (2 at most) will extinguish the threat.When battling the Parasite, use the shotgun against the little spider looking guys, and the machineguns against the two legged parasite.

I lost my old Halo 2 disc ages ago and I finally decided to buy a &#34;new&#34; used copy. Played it with my brother and we would have played all night had my mom not yelled at us for playing until the early hours of the morning (c'mon mom, I'm 21!). Anyways, amazing game and I'm glad I bought it again.

I didn't pick this game up until it dropped to $20, mainly because I had heard mixed reviews about it. After playing it, I'm beginning to think that many reviewers are just jaded from the surplus of platformers available on the market. The game is beautiful and easy to learn. Voodoo Vince is a very cute mascot with just enough personality to crack up even the most serious of players.StoryThe story is pretty entertaining. You are a voodoo doll named Vince. You are the &quot;third best&quot; doll of a woman by the name of Madame Charmaine, who has been kidnapped by Kosmo the Inscrutable. During the crime, Vince has zombie dust sprinkled on him, bringing him to life and allowing him to receive telepathic messages from Mme. Charmaine.CharactersVince is a very likable character, with his tongue in cheek disdain for all things platforming (e.g. &quot;Another musical gate puzzle...hooray&quot;). I can't decide if he has very low or very high self-esteem, because his character seems to waffle between the two. In any case, he is very entertaining. Mme. Charmaine's visual role is small after her abduction, but her voice haunts you throughout the game (think Cleo from the Psychic Friends network). The main &quot;baddy&quot;, Kosmo, reminds me of Bert from Sesame Street. He is supposed to be quite comical, but I find it hard to believe that a Muppet could pull off such a heist!GameplayThe gameplay is standard 3D platforming at its best -- jump around and float/hover to drop more slowly and find secret areas. Your special attacks are one of the more novel I have seen. To harm a large number of enemies around you, you invoke a random special attack which involves...hurting yourself! You collect icons throughout the game that add to your portfolio of attacks, including my favorite: the shark attack.WOW! Animation and Great TunesA few other reviewers have dissed the animation, saying it isn't XBox calibre, but I couldn't disagree more. The first time Vince looks in an old, worn out mirror in the first level, I was amazed at the attention to detail that the designers put into this game. The burlap on Vince looks so real that I expect to get a rash from touching its rough surface! Everything else is cartoony, but the lighting effects are excellent, as is the feeling of age in certain areas (e.g. inside an old drainpipe).Jazz and blues tunes permeate this title, giving it a real Cajun feel. The Main Street level of The Quarter really feels like New Orleans, especially how the music speeds up when Vince catches on fire. (Don't ask...it's an important part of the story).Will This Gather Dust?It certainly won't in my collection. Vince is cool, and his antics are classic. I am still revisiting levels trying to get all of the pages and skulls that I missed the first time through.At $20, this game is a steal.Overall Recommendations:You'll like this if:* You grew up on platformers and still love them.* You like Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga style humor.* You like New Orleans.

MUNCH'S ODDYSEE is the first game in the Oddysee franchise that I have played.  The first two games in the series were released on Playstation formats, but MUNCH'S ODDYSEE came out on X-Box and was one of the launch games of that system.  I first played this game at a friend's house not long after it came out.  I was fascinated by the amazing graphics and having different characters in the world literally follow the main characters around.  It wasn't until recently, however, that I was able to get the game myself and play it all the way through.MUNCH'S ODDYSEE is the third game in the Oddworld series.  If you're like me and have never played any of the other games in the series, that's okay because there's a movie at the beginning of the game that explains Abe's adventures in the first two games and the connection between Abe's race, the Mudokon's, and Gabe's race, the Gabbits.  Munch is the last living Gabbit, but is captured by the evil Vykkers, a race of creatures bent on domination, consumerism, industrialism, and environmental destruction.  Munch is taken captive and one of the early levels of MUNCH'S ODDYSEE involves helping Munch escape from the Vykker's labs' ship.  Once Abe and Munch meet up, the general storyline of the game involves getting back to the Vykker's Labs ship to rescue the egg crates full of Mudokon young and save the last can of Gabbit eggs in existence.The graphics in the game are amazing.  It feels and looks like you are playing a movie.  This shouldn't come as a surprise because the Oddworld series was originally conceived as a set of films.  However, the company, Oddworld Inhabitants, started making video games instead.  Oddworld Inhabitants has gone back to their original plans and the first Oddworld movie is apparently in production.As for game play, MUNCH'S ODDYSEE is simple enough that even most beginning gamers can play along fairly easily, yet the game has enough challenges to make it interesting enough for life-long gamers.  The game is fun to play and appeals to children and young adults, but has enough humor and oddity to appeal that it appeals to older gamers, too.  Now that I've experienced Oddworld, I'm looking forward to the cinematic tales Oddworld Inhabitants will bring.
MUNCH'S ODDYSEE is the first game in the Oddysee franchise that I have played.  The first two games in the series were released on Playstation formats, but MUNCH'S ODDYSEE came out on X-Box and was one of the launch games of that system.  I first played this game at a friend's house not long after it came out.  I was fascinated by the amazing graphics and having different characters in the world literally follow the main characters around.  It wasn't until recently, however, that I was able to get the game myself and play it all the way through.MUNCH'S ODDYSEE is the third game in the Oddworld series.  If you're like me and have never played any of the other games in the series, that's okay because there's a movie at the beginning of the game that explains Abe's adventures in the first two games and the connection between Abe's race, the Mudokon's, and Gabe's race, the Gabbits.  Munch is the last living Gabbit, but is captured by the evil Vykkers, a race of creatures bent on domination, consumerism, industrialism, and environmental destruction.  Munch is taken captive and one of the early levels of MUNCH'S ODDYSEE involves helping Munch escape from the Vykker's labs' ship.  Once Abe and Munch meet up, the general storyline of the game involves getting back to the Vykker's Labs ship to rescue the egg crates full of Mudokon young and save the last can of Gabbit eggs in existence.The graphics in the game are amazing.

I've always been a big fan of the Oddworld series, ever since Abe underwent his first Oddysee, back in the glory days of the PSone. I think the real hook for me with that first game was realizing there was a button entirely dedicated to forcing your on-screen character to fart. I'd never seen anything like it before and it's one of the major reasons I went ahead and bought my first Playstation, along with Oddworld: Episode I as my first game. It had inspired gameplay, an offbeat sense of humor that hit all the right notes, great voice acting and incredible replay value.Fortunately enough, many of those qualities have remained intact beyond Abe's second game and now into Oddworld's third chapter. My one major qualm about Abe's Exoddus (the second game), the change in voice actors for Abe himself, has now been repaired. With the old feel back again, a new character, a stunning jump to 3-D and a continuation of the old story, there should be nothing holding this game back from perfection... right? Well, not entirely so.Despite everything it's got going for it, there are a few little factors about this game which serve to do nothing more than irritate. Nearly every operation required of your character is performed with one button. The Xbox controller's "A" Button is used to jump, press buttons, pick things up, pull switches, activate portals, climb into a wheelchair, operate machinery, or grab a drink from one of the game's vending machines. The rest of the controller's buttons are used for conversing with non-playable characters, a task which was completed by holding in one of the L or R buttons and pressing another button in earlier games in the series. As a result, you'll often jump to your doom when you'd rather lift something up or something equally as silly. In addition, controlling Abe in the open field is notably difficult. There are points where precision is an absolute necessity, but Abe's veering left when you want him to go forward. For a game of this magnitude, with a control system that was already tweaked to perfection, it's silly that they muddled things like that. You'll eventually get used to the inadequacies of the system, but will never get to the point where Abe or Munch does exactly what you want every single time.Another thing that slightly irked me was the length of the game. Though it's certainly nothing to sneeze at, I completed everything in around eight hours. Maybe nostalgia has fogged my mind, but I don't remember the first two games as being that short. But, as I said, it's a minor issue and not one I'll really take anything away for. Just don't go into this expecting an epic on par with Final Fantasy or Grand Theft Auto.The way this game looks is simply amazing. As a first-wave launch title for the Box, I'll admit I had set my expectations a little loftily, but Munch's Oddysee surpassed even my steep hopes and wishes. Every step of this world is visually stunning, from the soft gradient of the outdoor skies to the brown, crusty grime gathered around the toilets in the later stages. The attention to detail is off the charts, and I'd occasionally just set the controller down and take everything in. It's that good looking.In addition, the pre-rendered CGIs maintain the standard set forth by the previous episodes. The cinemas were always one of my favorite parts of Oddworld, and the envelope continued its trend of moving forward here. Just great, great stuff, brought full circle with some spot-on voice work.The audio tells you everything you need to know when first gaining your surroundings in a new area. With Dolby support, it's possible to locate a lost Mudokan with your eyes shut. You can hear the click-click-click of an enemy slig down the hallway. The music is fresh, maintaining a beat in the background but never overpowering the scene. It picks up when you're being assaulted or chased, and dips back down when you're just patiently exploring. The cartoony sound effects are occasionally out of place and unnecessary, but on the whole don't interfere. My one problem with the audio was more a planning issue than anything else. Every once in a while, you'll run into a 'spiritual advisor', who tells you what you need to be doing in that part of the stage. It's pretty important you understand what he's saying, yet subtitles aren't available in case someone you can't hear him for some reason. A vacuum cleaner was running elsewhere in the house one afternoon, and I had to wait for some time before I could continue because I needed to know what he was telling me. Subs should've at least been an alternative option...The story is pure Oddworld. It kept me intrigued every step of the way, even if what I was doing was repetitive. There's an overlying theme of lightheartedness, and the same issues of extinction and over industrialization are covered in a new and interesting way. With rumors claiming there are three alternate endings, depending on how many innocents you save through the game, there's also the promise of enjoyable replay value without identical results.All in all, the series has made a successful, albeit rocky, jump into the world of 3-D. The graphics are very impressive, even by today's unrealistic standards, the audio isn't flawless (though it's close), the controls need some work, and the story has never been better. This is a really fun game to play, and though it does get a little easy, there's always just enough challenge to keep veteran players occupied without losing interest. It's a great way to kick off your Xbox collection, whether you're young or old, new to gaming or hardened from years of battle.

The original Oddworld game, Abe's Oddysee, was pretty challenging. (I never got around to playing Abe's Exxodus.) It was definitely a thinking man's game. It appeared to be a platformer, but in truth it was a puzzle game through and through. The controls and character animations were not geared towards true platforming action. It was about figuring out what precise series of steps you had to take to reach areas, and how to guide/help/manipulate NPC characters to reach areas. For the most part, Munch's Oddysee is the same sort of game. [Arbitrary edit by one of Amazon's faceless editors.] I never encountered any puzzle that was as tough to crack as the toughest puzzles in Abe's Oddysee. I don't object to the few levels in which you send a squad of allies to attack enemies. When you spend so much time in the game sneaking around and fearing for your life, turning the tables on the bad guys once in a while feels great. One thing that hurts the challenge level is that you can literally save anywhere. ANYWHERE. In the original, if you had to run a long gaunlet of several tough manuvers, you just had to keep trying over and over until you were able to perform them all in one go. In this game, if you're faced with a series of 20 demanding jumps, you can make the first jump, save, make the second jump, save etc. If you miss the final jump, rather than have to start back at the beginning, you can just reload your last "quicksave" and try that final jump until you get it.

A very weird, but entertaining plot, Munch's Oddysee starts off with explaining each characters (Munch and Abe) story.  It's up to you (the gamer) to save Oddworld from the evil Vykkers, greedy bigwigs, and the Glukkons!  You will be playing the game as Munch AND Abe, always switching back and forth between levels, or in the same level.  You will be saving from fuzzles about to fry, to Muddokins about to die!!!  Sound ODD so far?!?Munch's Oddysee has to be the PERFECT puzzle game for pretty much anyone w/ a crazy and funny sense of humor.  Even parents can get hooked on this great puzzler!  With great eye candy, and great visuals of camera angles, this game did not hold back on graphics and creativity!  Through the levels, you will need to work through some puzzles to move through to later stages.  Most of the time, Munch and Abe will need to work as a team.  Although there are some levels that include fighting and violence, its pure fun and excitement, rather than blood and gore.(Making it very suitable for young ages!)  You will also need to save many furry little creatures called fuzzles, and Abes friends called Muddokins.(Who are pretty brain dead, and really needs Abe's guidance! :))If you are looking for a crazy, odd game that will keep you playing for hours on end, and never ending in excitement, im sure this game will be for you!  With great graphics, puzzles, and characters, this game is great for all ages!  You may want to rent this game before buying just to make sure this is the game that you can get into!  I hope this review helped you in deciding if this games for you! :)Sean Barnett

Halo 2 is definetely my favorite game for the Xbox system currently. With amazing graphics, gameplay, sound, many weapons, vehicles and the best online play to ever hit the Xbox so far, halo 2 is is the most playable game ever created.Halo 2 has a basic story, its just that Master Chief has returned and is once again trying to stop the covenant from taking over earth and all of the other planets. Master Chief is also trying to deny a weapon of massive power and one that would have a great effect on the world!Even though this game has a simple story, the gameplay is unthinkable. I will break up my review into different categories listed below...Graphics: One of the best parts of Halo 2 is definetely the graphics. The background detail is superb, the texture is smooth and clear. The water is also very well done compared to halo 1, but still not as good as some games have done. The cutscenes are worth bragging about, for example, when i was watching a halo 2 cutscene and my cousin came into the room he told me to "change the channel," as he obviousely thought i was watching television which i thought was kind of funny. The animations of your character reloading, moving and shooting are truely amazing as well, (you switch off from being the covenant and master chief throughout campaign) as it seems like a real movie like a previousely mentioned. Master Chief looks much cooler then he did in Halo 1, as he has a redesigned suit and many more guns with much better graphics. Although it seems like i am saying that the graphics are amazing, i do think that they could have done just a tiny bit of a better job on them just so that it could be one of the best games in terms of graphics to every hit the Xbox Console, that would be great! But all in all, the graphics are wonderful, and definetely not an aspect of the game to complain about, unless you are picky, wait, lemme refrase that, too picky!Gameplay: There is one word, and only one word to describe the gameplay in this game. Fun! Thats it, this is arguably the best game on the xbox console, and there are many reasons to support that.First of all, you are able to sprint at twice the speed that you could in Halo 1. For those of you who play Halo 2 you probobly do not see a difference really in the sprinting aspect. I didn't either when i first played the game, but after i played a lot of halo 2, and then played halo 1, you could definetely see the difference between the two in terms of the speed that you can sprint, which is much better then the first.You are also able to highjack vehicles which gives the game a little "grand theft auto" them to it which is very fun to do. When your playing on Xbox Live, you get a medal each time you highjack a vehicle. (You get medals for each bonus thing you do such as highjacking, sniping, assasinating, etc.) Of course you could not do this in the previous halo 1 game so thats another difference between the two.Another better thing in this game then there was before in the previous one is that the A.I is much smarter. For example, they can sometimes form a "short time alliance" with another enemy and they can swarm at you, or the grunts can hide behind corners and wait for you to come. The elites are also much better at dodging your shots which makes it much harder to hit them. Also, if you want your allies to drive a vehicle they can which you couldn't do in the first halo game. The only problem is that sometimes they don't show that they're smart by slamming into walls and you have to switch seats repetitively before they'll get there "nack" back.But as a result of my gameplay review, it has changed a lot over the long and painful time that it took for the sequel to come out.New Weapons: There are many new weapons in halo to and i will list them underneath. They include...(Keep in mind that the ratings are intirely my opinion)BR55 Battle Rifle: 2x scope, burst shots, all in all its an ok weapon, not the best. Long range: 6/10, Medium range: 6/10, Close range: 6/10Covenant Carbine: Basically the Covenant form of the Battle Rifle except that its not burst, its just a one shot fire. Pretty good though, as it can fire much faster then the battle rifle. Long range: 7/10, Medium range: 8/10, Close range: 8/10Particle Beam Rifle: Covenant form of Sniper rifle, except that if you shoot two shots in a row it has to charge back up which takes a couple seconds, but i think its better then the sniper rifle seeing that if you have a good aim, you can finish your enemy off quickly! (Or ally, ha ha!) Long range: 10/10, Medium range: 8/10, Close range: 6/10. The reason why the ratings decrease is because the closer you are to your enemy, the harder it becomes to shoot considering that your aimer is unbearably small, so its hard to aim, even from a far distance, but it doesn't take that much skill to be able to snipe people from afar.Brute Shot: In my opinion i hate this weapon. Only the brutes use it (in single player) and they can never kill me with it because it sucks. Its almost impossible to aim at anything moving from afar or even medium range. The only good thing is that the shots can bounce of walls, wooooopy! Long range: 1/10, Medium range: 3/10, Close range: 5/10Covenant Energy Sword: Probobly the best weapon for close range is the sword. Even from medium range you can lock on to your target and unleash a super upercut attack which is a one hit kill unless your openent uses a cheap overshield, which i personally think they should take out of the game, seeing that whoever has the overshield cannot be stopped by one person unless the openent has a sword or a rocket launcher. Long range: 0/10, Medium range: 8/10, Close range: 10/10Fuel Rod Gun: Ahhhh, i wish this gun was in multiplayer but i guess it would be way to cheap, considering the amount of ammo it has and that it is a one hit kill. But for single player it works mighty fine! Long range: 10/10, Medium range: 10/10, Close range: 10/10Two other things i have to add is that you can dual weild certain weapons, but the only problem with this is that you cannot chuck grenades when you are dual weilding which kind of makes sense when you think about it. Also, the rocket launchers can lock on to vehicles which makes it much easier to destroy those cheap @$$ vehicle lovers!Vehicles: I will now mention the new vehicles in Halo 2. They are...M12G1 Warthog LAAV- Basically the same as the previous Warthog, except it uses a Gauss Cannon which is a one hit kill instead of the machine gun. (The previous Warthog is in Halo 2 as well.)9/10Specter: Sort of like the Wraith, (Wraiths can be used in multiplayer now) except its faster and can hold three people, one for the plasma cannot turret at the back, one in the side seat, and one obviousely driving the vehicle. 9/10Shadow: The vehicle that the covenant use, can hold up to 8 combatents depending on the species of convenant, an ok vehicle when your using it. It uses a plasma cannon like the rest of the other covenant vehicles. 7/10Two more things i have to add about the vehicles are that the Banshee can now be used in multiplayer as well as the Wraith which makes multipayer much more fun.Sound: A great game needs great audio right? Well halo 2 listened. From the classic halo chant, to the rather heavy halo 2 beat, comes wonderful sound and definetely good enough quality that you can just sit their drinking tea/coffee and listening to it. Well, i guess if your that obsessed with the audio, you can just by the soundrack right?Online: Now comes the best part. The online multiplayer play. I have to say, i though crimson skies had the best online multiplayer play, but as soon as this hit came out i quickly regreted myself saying that. Basically, there are ranked games and unranked games, (unranked games are known as training games.) As you win ranked games you gain levels, you start out at level 1 and the last level is level 50, but i believe that the highest level right now is 27, so as you can see its extremely hard to work your way up once you get past level 20.The different ranked games are as follows...Rumble Pit: Up to 8 players all dualing it out against each other. Thit matchmake playlist can include normal slayer, all rockets, all swords, all shotguns, odball, or king of the hill. This is probobly my favorite kind of playlist to play.Team Skirmish: Up to 8 players, 4 on 4, on a team obviousely. This playlist usually includes the different types of Capture the Flag, team odball, 3 plots or assault. Pretty fun playlist to play!Team Slayer: 8 players, 4 on 4 against each other can include normal team slayer, team rockets, team swords, Fiesta Team slayer, team shotguns or team phantoms. Probobly runner up for my favorite playist to play halo 2 on.Head to Head: Simple straight up slayer games 1 v 1 can inlcude normal slayer, all swords or all rifles. Very fun, and addicting especially when your winning.Big team battle: Huge game, up to 16 players, 8 v 8 can include team slayer, different types of CTF, Assault, or land grab where you have to take over different areas of land. Very fun playlist as it sounds like, but can get very hard and boring considering that your dying a whole tun, especially when your playing on a smaller map.Clan Battles: Basically, you can join a clan which in different words is like a club and you get your clan together and battle with them in different match types. Pretty fun, good for bragging rights. When your clan starts winning, it will level up.In conclusion to my online review and whole halo 2 review, the online aspect is probobly the best part of this entire game. Its so much fun trash talking to your opponents and so addicting to play ranked games. You can also just play custom games where you can invite all your friends to play whatever type/map you want. You can also customize ever thinkable option which makes this game truely worth your time and money.Halo 2 delivers excellent gameplayer/graphics/sound/online play which definetely makes the game a worthy $50. Halo 2 is definetely not one of those games that you are going to end up returning straight away after you get it, you'll be twice as addicted to it as you were to Halo 1! (Unless you don't have Xbox, and if you don't like halo, no offence, but theres something wrong with you.)COLLECTORS EDITION:With collectors edition, you get a ton of new features which includes a cooler looking game case, a "behind the scenes" footage of halo 2 and how this amazing game was made. It also includes Visualizing the story (Concept Art, Early Level Design From Script to Game, Narrated Storyboards and Character Tests. Also, the collectors edition includes bonus materials which has features such as trailers from halo 1 and 2, Cut scenes, commentaries, Inside Bungie, A bungie history, before halo, the making of halo 1 and Gameographies.GET THE COLLECTORS EDITION, IT IS WORTH YOUR MONEY!

For those of you who play Halo 2 you probobly do not see a difference really in the sprinting aspect. I didn't either when i first played the game, but after i played a lot of halo 2, and then played halo 1, you could definetely see the difference between the two in terms of the speed that you can sprint, which is much better then the first.You are also able to highjack vehicles which gives the game a little "grand theft auto" them to it which is very fun to do. When your playing on Xbox Live, you get a medal each time you highjack a vehicle. (You get medals for each bonus thing you do such as highjacking, sniping, assasinating, etc.) Of course you could not do this in the previous halo 1 game so thats another difference between the two.Another better thing in this game then there was before in the previous one is that the A.I is much smarter. For example, they can sometimes form a "short time alliance" with another enemy and they can swarm at you, or the grunts can hide behind corners and wait for you to come. The elites are also much better at dodging your shots which makes it much harder to hit them. Also, if you want your allies to drive a vehicle they can which you couldn't do in the first halo game. The only problem is that sometimes they don't show that they're smart by slamming into walls and you have to switch seats repetitively before they'll get there "nack" back.But as a result of my gameplay review, it has changed a lot over the long and painful time that it took for the sequel to come out.New Weapons: There are many new weapons in halo to and i will list them underneath. They include...(Keep in mind that the ratings are intirely my opinion)BR55 Battle Rifle: 2x scope, burst shots, all in all its an ok weapon, not the best. Long range: 6/10, Medium range: 6/10, Close range: 6/10Covenant Carbine: Basically the Covenant form of the Battle Rifle except that its not burst, its just a one shot fire. Pretty good though, as it can fire much faster then the battle rifle. Long range: 7/10, Medium range: 8/10, Close range: 8/10Particle Beam Rifle: Covenant form of Sniper rifle, except that if you shoot two shots in a row it has to charge back up which takes a couple seconds, but i think its better then the sniper rifle seeing that if you have a good aim, you can finish your enemy off quickly! (Or ally, ha ha!) Long range: 10/10, Medium range: 8/10, Close range: 6/10. The reason why the ratings decrease is because the closer you are to your enemy, the harder it becomes to shoot considering that your aimer is unbearably small, so its hard to aim, even from a far distance, but it doesn't take that much skill to be able to snipe people from afar.Brute Shot: In my opinion i hate this weapon. Only the brutes use it (in single player) and they can never kill me with it because it sucks. Its almost impossible to aim at anything moving from afar or even medium range. The only good thing is that the shots can bounce of walls, wooooopy! Long range: 1/10, Medium range: 3/10, Close range: 5/10Covenant Energy Sword: Probobly the best weapon for close range is the sword. Even from medium range you can lock on to your target and unleash a super upercut attack which is a one hit kill unless your openent uses a cheap overshield, which i personally think they should take out of the game, seeing that whoever has the overshield cannot be stopped by one person unless the openent has a sword or a rocket launcher. Long range: 0/10, Medium range: 8/10, Close range: 10/10Fuel Rod Gun: Ahhhh, i wish this gun was in multiplayer but i guess it would be way to cheap, considering the amount of ammo it has and that it is a one hit kill. But for single player it works mighty fine! Long range: 10/10, Medium range: 10/10, Close range: 10/10Two other things i have to add is that you can dual weild certain weapons, but the only problem with this is that you cannot chuck grenades when you are dual weilding which kind of makes sense when you think about it. Also, the rocket launchers can lock on to vehicles which makes it much easier to destroy those cheap @$$ vehicle lovers!Vehicles: I will now mention the new vehicles in Halo 2. They are...M12G1 Warthog LAAV- Basically the same as the previous Warthog, except it uses a Gauss Cannon which is a one hit kill instead of the machine gun. (The previous Warthog is in Halo 2 as well.)9/10Specter: Sort of like the Wraith, (Wraiths can be used in multiplayer now) except its faster and can hold three people, one for the plasma cannot turret at the back, one in the side seat, and one obviousely driving the vehicle. 9/10Shadow: The vehicle that the covenant use, can hold up to 8 combatents depending on the species of convenant, an ok vehicle when your using it. It uses a plasma cannon like the rest of the other covenant vehicles. 7/10Two more things i have to add about the vehicles are that the Banshee can now be used in multiplayer as well as the Wraith which makes multipayer much more fun.Sound: A great game needs great audio right? Well halo 2 listened. From the classic halo chant, to the rather heavy halo 2 beat, comes wonderful sound and definetely good enough quality that you can just sit their drinking tea/coffee and listening to it. Well, i guess if your that obsessed with the audio, you can just by the soundrack right?Online: Now comes the best part. The online multiplayer play. I have to say, i though crimson skies had the best online multiplayer play, but as soon as this hit came out i quickly regreted myself saying that. Basically, there are ranked games and unranked games, (unranked games are known as training games.) As you win ranked games you gain levels, you start out at level 1 and the last level is level 50, but i believe that the highest level right now is 27, so as you can see its extremely hard to work your way up once you get past level 20.The different ranked games are as follows...Rumble Pit: Up to 8 players all dualing it out against each other. Thit matchmake playlist can include normal slayer, all rockets, all swords, all shotguns, odball, or king of the hill. This is probobly my favorite kind of playlist to play.Team Skirmish: Up to 8 players, 4 on 4, on a team obviousely. This playlist usually includes the different types of Capture the Flag, team odball, 3 plots or assault. Pretty fun playlist to play!Team Slayer: 8 players, 4 on 4 against each other can include normal team slayer, team rockets, team swords, Fiesta Team slayer, team shotguns or team phantoms. Probobly runner up for my favorite playist to play halo 2 on.Head to Head: Simple straight up slayer games 1 v 1 can inlcude normal slayer, all swords or all rifles. Very fun, and addicting especially when your winning.Big team battle: Huge game, up to 16 players, 8 v 8 can include team slayer, different types of CTF, Assault, or land grab where you have to take over different areas of land. Very fun playlist as it sounds like, but can get very hard and boring considering that your dying a whole tun, especially when your playing on a smaller map.Clan Battles: Basically, you can join a clan which in different words is like a club and you get your clan together and battle with them in different match types. Pretty fun, good for bragging rights. When your clan starts winning, it will level up.In conclusion to my online review and whole halo 2 review, the online aspect is probobly the best part of this entire game. Its so much fun trash talking to your opponents and so addicting to play ranked games. You can also just play custom games where you can invite all your friends to play whatever type/map you want. You can also customize ever thinkable option which makes this game truely worth your time and money.Halo 2 delivers excellent gameplayer/graphics/sound/online play which definetely makes the game a worthy $50. Halo 2 is definetely not one of those games that you are going to end up returning straight away after you get it, you'll be twice as addicted to it as you were to Halo 1! (Unless you don't have Xbox, and if you don't like halo, no offence, but theres something wrong with you.)COLLECTORS EDITION:With collectors edition, you get a ton of new features which includes a cooler looking game case, a "behind the scenes" footage of halo 2 and how this amazing game was made. It also includes Visualizing the story (Concept Art, Early Level Design From Script to Game, Narrated Storyboards and Character Tests. Also, the collectors edition includes bonus materials which has features such as trailers from halo 1 and 2, Cut scenes, commentaries, Inside Bungie, A bungie history, before halo, the making of halo 1 and Gameographies.GET THE COLLECTORS EDITION, IT IS WORTH YOUR MONEY!
What can I say this game is just plainly awesome, and anything I could say wouldn't even describe the feeling of playing this game. If you loved Halo and FPS games you'll love this. Halo 2 takes place after the events on Halo.CAMPAIGN MODE:Campaign mode is really fun, with an awesome story; with all kinds of twists and turns. The campaign modes reveal new charters like the Prophets; leaders of the Covenant, as well as the Brutes, which is more of an enforcer that relies on Agression, and Buggers which are incests that use their speed and agility, and mass in numbers to try in their attacks. Also you you will encounter the Honor guard, which are Elites with tricked out body armor, and they have also given the Jackals a new look. Their are loads of new weapons and toys to play around with:Weapons-CampaignLike the new /Covenant Beam Rifile/- Which is the Covenant sniper Rifle mostly used by Jackals, super effective against every thing instant kill with head shot.You also have the new/ Battle Rifile/- Which is a new good looking rifile with a zoom that can fire three round burst at a time, whihc is very effective mid-close range combat.You also can now wield the/ Covenant Energy Sword/- Which is one heck of a weapon for people who like combat close and personal. Great for stealth I must say with two differet attacks basic mele and critical strike.I also loved the new/ Covenant Carbine/- Which is a very effective plasma semi automatic rifle which is ver effective on mid to long range targets, ggreat toy, more of a fall back weapon though like the Battle Rifile.They also have an new/ Sentile Beam/- Whihc is a weapon you will encounter latter in the game great against fllod along with the shotgun, and Plasma Sword. Shoots out beam similar to the flying sentlies you encounter.You also have a new gernade launcher called the/- Brute Shot/- which can shoot out gernades at a rapid speed. Good for shelling a group of enemies. You can deflect the gernades off walls to hit targets to, a sweet trick that you can use in latter levels of the game.In the game they have created the brand new, DUAL WIELD system, which makes it possible to wield two weapons at a time in different effictive combos, which opens the doors to all new possibiltes.Weapons/Dual Wield-Campaign/SMG/-A new sub machine gun that is very effective, especially when dual wield in different combos, an ideal weapon for close quaters combat. Probably the best weapon choice for efficient killing./Brute Plasma Rifle/-Just like the original, except it's red and called the Brute plama rifle no difference, except for Butes only use it.Just as great as the original./Magnum/- I really didn't like how they took the zoom, off the pistol, but it can be used in alot of effective combos like the the famous SMG and Magnum combo.So you can basically throughout the game use combos with all the weapons for example:Plasma Rifle and NeedlerSMG and Pistol(Magnum)Needler and SMGBrute Plasma Rifile and Plasma RifleSMG and SMGNeedler and NeedlerB.Plasma Rifle and NeedlerPlasma Rifle and Plasma RiflePlasma Pistol and Plasma RifleGraphis/New Changes:... well you get the point the new dual wield system really adds something to the combat. Oh, yeah The Rocket Launcher is now more of an heat seeker, than randomly firing at stuff, way more effective, and they have gave the game a whole new look with graphics ten times better than the original.They have also added destroyable environments like vechile damage, and such. A way better physics engine as well. To be honest the graphics are the best I've see to date.In campaign mode you also have new vechiles like:Other Toys-Campaign:/The Scarb/: Kind of like one of those Imperial Walkers from "Star Wars", That the Covenant has,  very powerful with a powerful laser blast./The Wraith/: A new Covenant motar tank, that is a pretty sweet toy to play with, but is not as effective as the scorpion tank, but does have a speed boost, which the also added to the Ghosts/The Spectre/: The Covenant version of a Warhog, can fit up to 3 passengers along with a driver and gunner fun, in multiplayer action, you don't use it as much in the campaign./The Guass Warhog/: A new vesion of the warhog with mor or a plasma type particle canon einstead of the basic machine gun. great new toy, but best used in multi player./Shadow/: A basic covenant troop transport vechile featured in the game can carry multible passanger as well as cargo, such as a ghost.Instead of drop ships that the original game had, Halo 2 features/Phantoms/ which are kind of like the covenant version of the Pillar of Autumn, used for dropping off troops and supplies at tatical points as well as good for doing som serios carnage.Campaign Overview:As you can see they have added a lot in the the game. Campaign Mode has 15 level, with brilliant landscapes, and unbelivable graphics, with a twist. You play as the Master Chief for part of the game, but you will also play part of the game as a Covenat elite called the Arbiter, this will give you more of the Covenant's side of he story. The game has a lot more depth than the original, and is way more advanced as well!!! Overall Campaign mode is fairly easy until you try Heroic, but will keep you busy for about 15 hours.Some people didn't like the ciff hanger ending so they said the game was rushed, how naive can some people be, the end just leads into Halo 3 which will be coming out with the new Xbox 360. I honestly wanted more after the end of the game, but really I don't like people who try to find something wrong with the game and make such a big deal about it. Halo 2 is a materpiece no doubt about it. The game is what all sci fi movies should be like. Hey I even heard they are coming out with a Halo movie, so watch out in the future.Multi- PlayerYes, Campaign mode is fun, but thee multi player fun is what really makes this game shine, whether it's from split screen action, to co op adventure, or playing against the world on Xbox Live whihc is darn fun. I got new for you the multi player will have you playing this game for hours for example.For example after school one day after I fininshed my homework, at 5:00 PM I started to have some fun playing on Xbox live, so I played and played, so when When I looked at the clock it was 2:00 AM, The game was so fun I played for another hour than I decide to go to bed. So, ipractilly become addicted to it. Lan parties are nice too link up with 15 other people and have some a good time and show your fiends what true marksmanship is all about.Halo 2 has a whole bunch of new maps, that ae very detailed and are so darn fun, with all the new weapons and such. The possiblites are endless. You can form your own tournments and so on and so forth. Multi player is what makes this game really fun. It's just darn addictive. You can eve customize your profile, which makes the game really cool.WHAT MAKES THE SPECIAL EDITION SO SPECIAL:If you are asking if you should go out and spend your money on the special edition, I say yeah go ahead. You get a second disc with "The Making of Halo 2" along with some great reading meterial from the Covenant's point of view, along with the cool silver case. Look, it is only a few bucks more so I say get your money's worth.Well, you don't have too,... if you don't want too and you want to save about a few bucks, but on Amazon. com they have it on sale anyway for about $40.00, at the current moment, so I really suggest you if you're an amazon shopper and you did not buy this game go ahead to. Either way it's still the same game special edition or not.OVERALL:Overall, this is the best game of 2004-2005 in my opinion. Great game, a must buy for an FPS fan, great sequel to Halo. This game gets a 5/5.... outstanding game, bring on part 3!!!-Rogue Fox"Rogue"

From the people who brought us Knights of the Old Republic comes another genre-blending game with a fabulously twisting plot.  If you own an Xbox, you should own this game.  It is not only the best Action RPG on the Xbox but one of the best RPGs played in recent memory.For those who have played KOTOR, this game will be instantly familiar.  At the offset, you pick a character and are thrust into a world of moralities.  Unlike KOTOR, the morality system is a little more complex for the most part.  Instead of focusing on good and evil, your character has the choice of being endlessly helpful, understanding and tolerant of everyone (in other words believes in the power of the human spirit) or someone who reveres strength.  As an example of this strength concept, there is a decision early on about a dam that is open and has caused problems for a town because the sailors are land locked.  A wine merchant wants the dam to remain open so he can make a killing off of the sailors.  If you follow the Way of the Open Palm you would probably close the dam so that the town can prosper in what is should be doing.  If you follow the Way of the Closed Fist, on the other hand, would decide that if the town were strong they will survive this current hurdle and that it is only that, a hurdle.  It gets a little more tricky than that and does open some areas for roleplaying your character and deciding what you would really do in that situation.  Bioware is also wonderful at making you think about your decision as they give you new information just as soon as you make a decision that might change how you feel about the situation.My only complaint with the system is that while they say that the two paths are different from looking at things as good and evil, there are still some instances where there is a "good" and an "evil" way of doing things.  I might have rationalized why I would be doing something that way, yet I would get points from the side I didn't want because it was clearly delineated as "good and evil choice."  So, that's a bit frustrating given that their system isn't supposed to be good and evil.  But, overall the system works well and really makes you think.I didn't really care for KOTOR because of the battle system and that is probably the reason I'm enjoying Jade Empire much more.  The fighting system is simple yet deep.  As you progress you will learn different martial arts style that you can map to the D-pad for quick and easy access.  And you will be constantly changing your styles as the techniques to defeat enemies will constantly evolve.  Some monsters are immune to certain attacks so you will have to experiment and find the best ways of devastating your foes.On the simple side, the combat is really about rock, paper scissors.  You have a quick attack and a time-consuming attack (and a knock back attack that really only helps when you are surrounded and need some space).  When someone blocks you use your time consuming attack, otherwise you mostly use your quick attacks to offset their own long attacks.  It's pretty simple and easy to used to.  However, some battles can become a button masher either way you look at it.  But it's still exhilarating and fast with many ways of deciding how you want to play.  Do you want to focus on using weapons, martial arts, magic, transformations?  A little of the above?  It's all up to you.The game is beautiful most of the time.  The art style is impeccable and really helps create a full-flesh universe.  Since it's based on oriental myth, it doesn't take place in the Orient as we know it but a mythical world that incorporates themes from oriental culture.  Because of this, the desiginers are free to create whatever their imagination can make.  And it's beautiful.  There are some places that I stood for awhile and just looked because it was so surreally beautiful and soothing.  It made me wish that sometimes our world wasn't so industrialized and that we could go back to what was a more simple beauty.  It was that affecting.  However, sometimes, the backgrounds look painted on.  Some of the hills and areas that act as blockades for where you can't go aren't that well designed.  Also my character's body type makes me laugh because his pecs are super large and his abs are indented in his body that I laugh whenever I see it.The game moves impeccably fast as well.  Your character runs and I mean runs through the areas.  The framerate is great.  But, like KOTOR before it, the game stutters sometimes when you are running and turning the camera.  When the camera pans, the game flutters sometimes as it tries to take in everything that happens.  In battles, the game hardly ever stutters.  And the battles can end up having a good dozen or so enemies fighting you and your partner so they can get pretty hectic and the graphics engine does a great job keeping the motion moving.Aurally, the game is a treat.  You will find some cameo voice actors that are immediately familiar (look for John Cleese in a hysterical role).  The music is well done and has a wonderful oriental bent to it (of course).  Also, Bioware hired a real linguist to help create the fictional language used in the game.  It is very familiar to oriental language but isn't real.  It was created solely for this game.  And that's amazing.Unfortunately, my problem with the dialogue in the game is the same problem I had with KOTOR.  It's great and all but all too often the plot developments and dialogue becomes a "talking head" type situation where anyone who has something important to say gets a close up of their face while their lips move and the dialogue is heard.  This is unfortunate for me because I get impatient sometimes and will just read the subtitles and skip through most of their dialogue.  It's never "dynamic" in cutscenes like in some RPGs I've played (hands down the best use of dialogue in an RPG goes to FFX that used dialogue to move the plot but it wasn't a novel dialogue; it was more of a movie dialogue).  The dialogue in Jade Empire is sometimes like a novel.  So, for those who aren't interested in talking heads delivering dialogue this might get annoying after a time.  But the dialogue is genuinely well voiced and excellent.My only other complaint is the load times.  While not as annoying constant as Fable where each and every small zone no matter how small had to be loaded for a good 5-10+ seconds, it still is a pain when you have to go through zones for a quest.  For instance, in the beginning of the game you have to go through the town to the school (a load screen) to get a quest, go back to town (load screen) to talk to someone, then back to the school (load screen).  And it's unfortunate because the actual quest takes maybe a minute, but a good 20 seconds of the time is spent in load screens.  That's a uncharacteristic load time though as generally the areas are big and don't usually require many loads.  Although another incident where it is very noticeable is in an arena combat situation where before and after each arena battle it has to load for a good 5-10 seconds.  The kicker is, some of the arena battles are over in about a minute or much much less and yet you have to deal with two load screens comprising a good 10-20 seconds.  So, in some areas it can be annoying and definitely pulls you out of the game when you should be pulled further in.  And, it becomes especially annoying considering that games like Halo 2 are seamless after the original load.Overall, though, this game is gold.  It's perfectly plotted and paced and has Bioware's trademark in excellence stamped all over it.  It ranks as one of my favorite games this year so far along with God of War and Psychonauts.  I would definitely recommend buying this game.  There are some problems that I have noted but you know regardless of the problems, this is an excellent game with an excellent story.  And, at 22+ hours, this adventure is worth taking.**NOTE: You should definitely pick up this, the Limited Edition of it if you can still find it.  For the initial run they are all Limited Edition and after they are gone, you will only be able to get the standard game.  The Limited edition has a new character and weapon and a making of as well as some other fun things.  Same price, so definitely check this one out if you want the game.
Madden 2002 is a very good football game that falls just a little short of five stars.  I like the game an awful lot and have played a great deal (over 100 games (15 minute quarters of course) so far and will play a lot more) but there are some flaws.  In no particular order...The graphics in Madden are really nothing special.  They aren't terrible and the player animations during the game are nice, but the backdrops are dull and all too often you see players walk right through each other in the after play animations.Not nearly enough work was put into the experience of playing defense.  Madden has a very nice training mode for offensive plays which really carefully explains everything from blocking assignments to reading pass coverage.  There is also a sometimes nifty &quot;Ask Madden&quot; feature in offensive playcalling in which the game will reccomend offensive plays when prompted and even provide some reasoning for the choice but there is no such feature for defense.  You are pretty much on your own when it comes to calling plays on defense beyond the vague reccomendation in the EAsy play mode that you run 4-3 against the run and Nickel or Dime against the pass.  But that doesn't help explain the subtle differences between and 4-3 &quot;Thunder&quot; and a 4-3 &quot;Lightning&quot;.  Which is better against short yardage running plays?  Which is better against play action or screens?  You can get some ideas from looking at the small diagram of the play, but on the whole there is a lot lacking in defensive play calling.It is far too easy to run the football.  Running blindly won't work; but if you pay attention to the way the play is diagramed and follow your blocks, it isn't hard to rush for 250 yards on 20 to 30 carries in every game against the hardest difficulty setting (All Madden) with all the defensive AI settings cranked up as high as they go.  In contrast it is far too hard to pass the ball.  You really must read the defense and go through progressions (just throwing to your primary reciever or throwing to the same reciever over and over will not work) and that's quite fun, but recievers will drop balls way, way too often no matter how softly (or how hard) you throw the ball.  And if your reciever does not have the coverage beat by at least two steps the pass will be tipped or intercepted about half the time as defensive backs controlled by the computer seem to be blessed with superhuman closing speed.Another minor annoyance is the announcing.  Madden and Summerall are clear and conversational, but a lot of their comments are very out of place.  For example, five minutes into the first quarter you get the ball for the first time down a field goal and you run the ball for your first play.  Summerall will announce, shocked &quot;These guys still think they have time to establish the run!&quot;  And Madden, the sage, will respond, &quot;When you're down like this, it's time to put your faith in your quarterback.&quot;  Um, yeah.Finally, it is very hard to play fair, realistic football.  The first three difficulty levels are so easy once you get the basic controls down that it is no trouble at all to win by anywhere from five to ten touchdowns...and that's no fun.  The only level that can challenge you at all is All Madden and it does that by openly cheating.  The opposing defensive line will slice through your pass protection like a battle axe through butter without ever having to blitz, their receivers never drop balls (and, indeed, their defensive line has better hands than your best receiver), the computer's pass protection is near perfect unless you blitz with two extra men.  You will be penalized two or three times as often as the other team (and after about half of your big plays).  I think this could be fixed up some by forcing the computer to play fair (instead of cheating in the most blatant of ways) but then also teaching it how to play against the run a little better so you can't just run them over every game.Despite what it may sound like so far in the review, I really do think Madden 2002 is a fantastic game.  I really like the momentum based physics system and the game does a better job than any other of capturing the *feel* of real football (with the exception of the poor AI run defense).  The game comes with a ton of options in all its formats.  In its franchise mode you can create players, draft players, sign free agents, trade, progress players from poorly rated rookies to top notch stars over a few seasons, etc.  In season mode you can even edit the attribues of existing players (something I found necessary to make some of the players better match their real life counterparts (Mike Vick running slower than most fullbacks was just wrong, for example)).  This is actually a really neat option as it allows you to play the game you're in the mood for.  If you want a real high scorer, go in an jack up both teams offenses.  If you want a real low scorer, go in and pump up the defenses, etc.  There is a robust practice modes (although you can't practice with created or edited teams, which is annoying).  There is also a nice situation mode and a mini-game: the 2 minute drill (go in with any team against any team and see how many points you can score in 2 minutes).  Another nice feature are the Madden Cards.  You can earn challenge points for scoring in the 2 minute drill or for completing &quot;challenges&quot; in a regular game (i.e. throw for 300 yds, etc.) and use these points to buy packs of cheat cards that open up hidden teams and stadiums, boost current players and bring old ones out of retirement, or change other game conditions.In summary, if you like football games, go ahead and get this one.  You'll have a lot of fun with it (especially against friends) but don't expect perfection.  I hope I haven't turned anyone off of the game with some of my rants, but I also hope someone from EA Sports reads this and makes the appropriate adjustments.
Madden 2002 is a very good football game that falls just a little short of five stars.  I like the game an awful lot and have played a great deal (over 100 games (15 minute quarters of course) so far and will play a lot more) but there are some flaws.  In no particular order...The graphics in Madden are really nothing special.  They aren't terrible and the player animations during the game are nice, but the backdrops are dull and all too often you see players walk right through each other in the after play animations.Not nearly enough work was put into the experience of playing defense.

Tiring days of 'wouldn't it be great to have a game that combines the realism, tuning, gameplay and massive car selection of Gran Turismo with all the aftermarket parts, body kits, decal customizations, and mods of Need for Speed Underground' have finally seen a dawn of new morning.  A new day that will not settle quickly like many of the other overdone street, arcade, and simulated racers on the market.  Setting this game apart is a simple concept yet ungrasped by all in it's genre.  One that should have been taken care of with the 3rd or 4th series of Gran Turismo.  Reasons for glory:1) Well over 200 cars to choose from.  Plus X amount of downloadable cars.2) Manufacturers from all over the spectrum, all over the globe have made themselves available in Forza Motorsport. BMW, Volkswagen, Porsche, Chevy, Ford, Toyota, Honda, Acura, Subaru, Mitsubishi, Ferrari, Ashton martin, Bentley, Mazda, Chrysler, Pontiac,  and Lancia to only name a few.3) Upgrades.  Upgrades.  Upgrades.  Throw in 3 or more levels of upgrades of aftermarket parts from performance tweaking: engine tuning, turbos, superchargers, air intakes, exhaust, cambers shmambers, brakes, cam shafts, throws, suspension, intercoolers, rims, and tires etc.. to body kits: hoods, hood scoops, front bumpers, side skirts, rear bumpers, spoilers, and window tint to skin visuals: custom paint jobs and an endless array of decals to slap on.  One hundred layers of decals can be applied to each section (top; roof, hood trunk, sides, and bumpers) of the car.  Many shapes, designs, and aftermarket logos can be re-sized, colorized, tilted, or spun to give your mod car endless potential.4) The gameplay of Forza is a cross between "Gran Turismo" and "RalliSport"., leaning more towards the "RalliSport" side of the house,  which translates to head-pinning ultra driving realism.  Don't like the car's handling? Upgrade the suspension, brakes, or tires or tweak them using the tuning mode.  Each and every car handles, drives and sounds the way it should.  This game offers solid control and a realistic simulated driving experience.  Difficulty level can be set to many different degrees of variation to tweak the game for a challenge that fits each individual.  Harder difficulties will award the driver more credits after each victory.  One does not have to be in first place to earn credits.  All places except for last will be rewarded credits.  Ofcourse, the higher place finishes will earn you more credits.  Credits will be subtracted from the total earned for damage penalties.  Yes, I said "Damage penalties".  Days of ramming into walls and other cars at maximum speeds with no worries of damage or hindered performance have been washed out with the tide.  This game offers one of the most realistic programmed damage engines I've seen to date.  Not only do you see damage done to your car but the damage done is different each time depending on where you are hit and how hard.  Ie Bumpers hanging off, dents, scrapes, dirt, mud, smashed tail lights, broken windows, hoods on the verge of falling off, doors smashed in, side mirrors broken off etc.. I have even seen spoilers fly off of cars in this game from the impact of rear collisions.  These types of collisions can be fun to watch to say the least, especially if you are the car who charged from behind.  Not so fun if you are driving the car that took damage.  Damage done to your car will also hinder it's performance.  Ie the car pulls to the right or left or there will be a decrease in acceleration and speed. A diagram will also flash showing where on the car that body and internal damage has been taken.  This includes wheel well, tires, steering, and surface damage.5) Events of all types will keep this game's tires burning pavement.  Events that are offered are based on Class, Horsepower, Region, AWD, RWD, FWD, Weight, Rivals such as the EVO Vs. STI, Car type, Special events, and events that become unlocked as you reach certain levels.  Your car must meet the specifications of that race to enter.  For instance, the "American Muscle" events only include cars that were made prior to 1975, obviously made in America and must have over X amount of HP and torque such as the Camaro SS, Corvette Stingray, and Dodge Challenger.  These type of events add a whole lot to the game in that it gives you an excuse to take out "Classic" cars or other specialty cars that you would normally not use in a regular event.  I've seen other games make classic cars like this unlockable, however you never get to use them because they serve no purpose for the upcoming events.  But not in Forza.  Win or buy a MUSCLE CAR and you'll have plenty of reasons to use it, which just adds to the excitement.  Like the Corvette Stingray for example, this is a great car to use in a muscle car drag event or when racing other muscle cars but cannot handle sport compact events at tracks with a lot of bends. In Forza, you can just take out the Stingray and match it with other cars of that category and genre, where it belongs.  More tracks become available as your LEVEL increases.  LEVELS increase as more credits are earned.  Credits are earned after each event.  These credits can be used to buy cars or upgrades.  After winning an entire event (an event consist of multiple races), you win a car that relates to that type of event.  Thus the stamina of replay value for this game remains strong.  In other words, addicting to the point of life consumption.6) The graphics in this game will blow your mind's transmission.  The car models in this game are nearly flawless.  You literally have to plant your face next to or on the TV to notice any pixelation.  The reflective skin of each freshly painted car render perfectly.  Microsoft is more of a master of landscapes than they are of architecture and it shows.  Their rendered "landscape" environments are refreshing and beautiful.  The rolling hills, mountains, trees, and area surfaces are some of the best I've seen.  The landscapes in FORZA come off more realistic than say "Need for Speed Underground II".  Although NFSU2 is beautifully rendered, it feels more "plastic" than real.  Which is not necessarily a "bad thing" considering it is a video game after all.  The cityscapes and buildings in FORZA are not as perfect in that they seem too organic and soft as if something out of a dream.  Can you say overdone anti-alias.  This doesn't affect it's score too much as you will be flying past them and thus the whole soft anti-alias thing will at times seem applicable.  Don't get me wrong, they are well done.  Just not up to par with Need for Speed Underground II and Gran Turismo.  Riding through New York City was dead-on with actuality in placement.  Each block, street, building, billboard were depicted almost seamless to what you would see if for some reason Time Square was actually blocked off for you to ride through it.  I think I even saw Robert Deniro trying to catch a cab.  This nearly dead-on placement accuracy is the case with most cities, areas, and actual race tracks in the game.  And you will be more than satisfied with the diversity and amount of tracks there are to choose from.To be continued..Buy this game now!!
I had this game on preorder for nearly a year, and when it came out I purchased the HALO 2 special edition box that came with, the tin case and two CD's one with the game on it, and one with a DVD showing the making of Halo 2. I was also told that there would be a CD with the Halo 2 soundtrack. When I first opened the tin case, I expected a separate place to store each CD, however, the two CD's were stored in the same place on top of each other. Not a big deal, but its kind of cheap that they would do that. Also there is no soundtrack in the special edition case.Overall Halo 2 is a very good game, but not as good as the original in my opinion.  I originally thought this game was painfully boring, but the later levels in this game were in fact very fun and involving.  I just wish it could have been a little longer and also the middle levels to be as fun as the last ones.Graphics: The best part of this game is the graphics. The graphics in Halo 2 are much clearer and crisper than the original, and is the best of my XBOX collection. If you don't look hard enough, you will think that you are watching a movie. The characters and textures in this game are rendered near perfectly and also the lighting effects were done very well.  The scenery looks almost lifelike especially when you are outside.  These are the best graphics I have seen in a game ever in my opinion.  Graphics get a perfect 10.Sound: The sound in this game is also very well done; the biggest disappointment here however is that the sounds of the guns do not have the "punch" as the weapons from the original game. Everything sounds like a BB gun, the only gun that sounds pretty good is the sniper rifle. The voiceovers are a nice touch and I like them fairly well. Even though some of the Covenant voiceovers are cheesy. The music is also pretty well done, but falls a bit short of the original game.Gameplay: This is what hurts the game the most.  Bungie did not do a good job of getting you involved in the game on the first and middle levels. I mean you are there, but you don't feel like you are there. The game does not really have any distinct mission goals and is basically a shoot everything that moves game. There is no shortage of enemies you will often find you run out of bullets and have to run around picking up guns off the ground. The annoying flood is back and they are still very annoying, they even made those flood "bugs" stronger, and they will kill you if you don't shoot them. In the first Halo, you could just let them pop off of you and your shield will only be damaged a little. Now if you do that, you shield will go down fast and you will die fast. Another annoying thing about the game play is that you have no idea how much energy you have left once you loose your shield, expect a lot of "random" deaths because you just don't expect something just brushing up against you to kill you. The middle levels are looooong, repetitive and boring. Good thing you can save at anytime your last checkpoint so you don't have to sit at the TV for an hour just to complete one level.  However, like I mentioned earlier, the later levels are very fun to play and once I got past the last boring level in the game, I played Halo all the time.Another thing I must mention about the game is that I really don't like how the game switches control between the Master Chief and a Covenant arbiter. It sucks and makes the game a bit confusing.  The corniest part of the game is that every character can drive every vehicle, yep, Covenant can ride in Scorpions in the human warthog. If you think that is bad then please let me finish, the flood too can ride in human and covenant vehicles. They can't walk straight or barely shoot, but they have enough dexterity to operate a tank or jeep? Please!! Get the hell out of here!!! When I first saw a warthog driving towards me shooting at me, I thought it was the covenant, but when it got closer, I saw it was the flood riding 3 deep in the warthog! One in the driver's seat, one in the passenger seat and one in operating the turret!! When I first saw that I nearly burst out laughing, it had to be funniest thing I seen in a video game in a long time.I pushed through the boring levels, and was very impressed with the final ones.  However the ending was very disappointing.  I could not believe it was over that quick.  In fact, when I first beat the game, for some reason my XBOX did not play the credits, and I was returned the to main menu after a final cut scene, so I played the final part of the game again, and this time I did get the credits.  I just stared at the screen in disbelief, as I could not believe that this game was over so quickly.  On top of that, it leaves you hanging, I guess that was Microsoft's idea, in order to get even more anticipation for Halo 3, which almost certainly will come out based on Halo 2's ending!I am pretty satisfied with the game overall, does it live up to the hype?  Not in my opinion, but it still is a great game.  I originally said I hated it, but I am glad I did give it a chance.I don't plan to play on XBOX live because it is saturated with immature kids who act stupid and mess up the game.  Not to mention all the lame cheaters on XBOX Live.  In fact I am going to cancel my subscription before it renews next year!

I'm glad these are becoming more affordable because with the state of games today it's hard not to spike these off the floor.
Its flawless. It was cheaper than normal, but the condition was pristine so we were very happy! It holds a charge, and the buttons and joy sticks are smooth and do not stick.
needed a new one, as the other broke, again, but that was not the remotes fault it was the harsh playing by the kids
