This is a wicked bad game. Its its also wicked hard. Basically all you do is run a round like a mad man and kill things. Sounds fun. Guess what. ITS NOT. I mean you have to repair your weapon!! What the heck is that all about. And theres boxes that you open and they turn into ENEMYS! YUCK!

Now this game has gotten great reviews. A lot of my freinds have it and love it. But I just dont understand why. Wiping out is cool and a lot of fun on the stunt mode and thats why I gave it the 2 stars. Racing is boring. I tjought ATVs would of worked but I guess they didnt.Better just stick to cars and motorcycles.

"I will stop you to go forward" the portal watcher of Ulara said to me, the main protagonist.  Of course what she meant was "I won't let you pass."Above is just one hilarious example of the terrible dialogue in this game.  The dialogue is consistently this bad throughout the entire game, demeaning the characters, story, and entire game to amateur level.Dungeons are the heart of this game's gameplay, which are long and tedious.  Same areas are used in different locations with at least one battle in each area.  The numerous battles and repetitious dungeons make the gameplay incredibly slow and dry.Supposedly this game is well known for its cool battle quirks.  This is true, almost everything you do in a battle is effected in some way by player performance.  However I did not find this to be enjoyable.  After hundreds of battles I was pleading for the game to automate my attacks.  Repetition of button-timing and button-mashing mini games during battles became tiresome extremely fast.Soundtrack was quite nice though, paralleling Final Fantasy series quality.  This however doesn't make up for the rest of this mess.With poor story and gameplay, this game is not something I enjoyed playing.

I am forced to admit that GT5 gives you a lot for your money, but there were so many head-slappingly inane decisions made about the gameplay that I am forced to give this a hostile review:1.  The main thing I hated about this game was that there were no difficulty settings.  Basically you must take everything at full-bore difficulty, and woe to you if this is too hard.  But really, it's not that some of the tracks are hard so much as the WAY they were hard.  You're driving a car worth about 45,000 and they put you in races with supercars worth 20 million?  (Not just that, but there's no way you youself can possibly purchase such cars at this point.)  This is neither fun nor fair, but there's nothing you can do about it.  So you just start calculating to yourself, "If I were to come in first place in this race 215 times, I would have enough money to buy one of those Ferraris."2.  Another gripe I have is that in this game, supercars are not supercars.  Naturally after you've been playing for a little while you will shop around for a Ferrari or a Lamborghini.  Don't spend your money:  instead, go to the Internet, where you'll find discussion forums that will tell you that you can get a much better-performing car for a lot less, say the Nissan GT-R.  But this is a little ridiculous.  The game doesn't seem right when a 2009 fully-decked out Lamborghini is getting comprehensively out-performed by a garden-variety Nissan sedan!  Something seems wrong.3.  There are no Porsches to be had in this game, for licensing reasons, I assume.  This is probably not the programmers' fault, but still.4.  One can maximally have only 20 million in the bank.  This really blows since the cars that cost 20 million will cost you more than that, since it's virutally impossible to ding 20 million precisely:  any money earned over that will simply not be recorded.  But what really blows is that when you finally buy that Lamborghini Miura, you'll have to garage it until you can buy tires for it.  This really seemed wrong.5.  There exists a big gap between the Professional Series and the Extreme series.  Basically, if you'd like to continue into the Extreme Series, you're going to need a car that is worth several million dollars.  The problem is that nothing you can possibly do in the Professional Series is going to net you anywhere near that amount of money.  There is simply no way to transition smoothly from the Profeesional Series to the Extreme Series.  Hence the only solution is you've got to sit there for a couple of weeks running your B-spec drivers robotically around Daytona-style tracks until you have enough money to continue on with the next phase of the game.  So basically the game gets held up for a week or two while you get on to other things, such as your homework.  This was an asinine design decision.6.  The player is not able to control realism settings.  You've got no choice but to put up with weather, tire burn-out, car damage, etc.7.  The cars you win for finishing certain series can only be won once.  This doesn't make sense.  Can you imagine telling contestants in any sort of game that they can't win the prize because they've already won such a prize in the past?8.  The game plays with you by racing cars against you that are not readily available for purchase, such as the Yellowbird or the Chaparral.  I did not find this amusing.9.  There are not enough tracks!  This is because so many of the tracks are wasted on idiotic races (e.g., a tournament for the owners of a VW Lupo!?!?) that when you'd like to take one of your cars out for a race, there are only three or four choices to choose from?  You can only select the track of your choice if you're just practicing or if you're running cars that you don't own (i.e., GT mode).  But as for taking your beloved babies out on tracks you never get to see them on, forget it!  Those tracks are reserved for the pickup truck races!10.  One is not allowed to restart races in tournaments.11.  Having the cost of re-structuring the chassis be half of the car's value was totally unfair, as was the cost of an engine overhaul.  These prices are punitive, not realistic.  And what's the point of this anyways?  Next up:  having us pay for gas and insurance?  (Incidentally, I discovered that one's chassis breaks automatically without your even crashing the car.  Here's how:  1)  buy new car.  2)  enter race  3) immediately exit race before driving an inch.  You'll now have the option of restoring the chassis, implying that the car is damaged, since you're not permitted the option of paying for chassis repairs if the car is not damaged.)12.  Your car has to come in for pitstops for new tires and stuff:  other cars don't.  On the Extreme B-spec races, for example, it is only your car that has problems with tires balding out about lap 9:  the other cars never seem to.  Why is that?13.  The physics of the game don't make sense.  First of all, it's impossible to flip your car, no matter what you do.  There is no animation for it.  Neither do cars crash or show damage (though you have to pay for chassis damage).  But it goes deeper than that.  It seems like the physics of crashing and interacting with walls and other cars don't resemble reality.  For example, if you go off the track and hit a wall at, say, a 20 degree angle, your car will be smashed back to about a 160 degree angle, facing the wrong direction.  NEVER are you simply "righted" back to a zero degree angle.  It's almost as if the game is punishing you for crashing into walls, but in a way that doesn't make sense visually.  There's more, too.  There seems to be a sort of magnet effect going on sometimes.  Unlike my first example, this might actually be real physics:  I don't know, but it sure feels wrong.  What I mean is that when you run up on the rear end of the car in front of you, your car seems to "stick" and you can't detach yourself unless you completely slam on your brakes.  You can't simply scrape off to one side.  The same goes if your car is running along a wall, scraping along it at high speeds.  It seems like you ought to be able to steer away from it, detaching yourself.  But instead you're magically stuck to the wall somehow, and you can only veer away from it by greatly reducing your speed.14.  Further, the physics of collisions seem unfair.  Every time you collide with another car, yours is the one that is bumped off the road into the sand, never the enemy's.  It seems like this should happen about 50% of the time, but no.  It's virtually impossible to knock an opponent's car off the track:  if you do, it recovers immediately.  It seems like if there is a collision, it negatively affects only your car.  Why do you always get the short end of the stick?15.  The prices in this game are totally messed up!  You can buy a car for 2 million, deck it out with all the trimmings, and then, when you go to sell it, get about 200,000 for it, even though you haven't put a single mile on it!  This is not how reality works.  Realism-based, eh?16.  The game keeps making you go over to Google to find out what kinds of cars you're talking about.  When you're in the used store, for example, how'm I supposed to know that an SLS AMG is a kind of Mercedes? [This was fixed in a patch.]17.  As of the 2.02 update, the game has started to get more mercenary.  There will be cars displayed available for purchase, but you can't buy them unless you pay the company extra money for additional downloadable content through the PlayStation store.  A good example of this is the VW Golf '07.  Before the 2.02 patch, you could simply buy it from the new car dealership.  After December 2011, however, you had to pay more money (literal money, not game credits) to get that car.  Sheesh.  You figure if you lay out forty or fifty bucks for the game, they'd be done hustling you, but no.18.  There's a huge gap with the difficulty at higher levels of the game:  they don't scale well.  After you get the Formula Gran Turismo, for example, it feels like you entered the cheat code and the remainder of the game is uninteresting, if not tedious.19.  The manual sucks!  This game was released more than a year previous to this review, and by now you'd think people'd know how to play the game.  No.  For example, what causes chassis damage?  Is it aggressive driving?  Collisions?  Or simply miles?  Nobody seems to know.  Various websites have various theories, but nobody seems to agree about this basic thing.  But don't look to the manual to clarify that or anything else:  the most the extremely brief manual will tell you is "if you have an epileptic seizure, you should stop playing."20. The tracks are aseptic, almost lifeless.  If I see the Monza circuit one more time, I'm gonna barf!  I can't put my finger on why the Need for Speed tracks seem so various and invigorating while those of GT5 seem so jejune, but it's definitely a problem.21.  There's no way to upgrade your braking and steering.22.  This game features ads up the wazoo:  currently for Motul, Agip, Dunlop, and some others.  These names will change with time because these companies have paid to have their logos plastered all over the racetracks and there's no way you can avoid them.23.  There's no way to prevent the game from auto-saving.  This would have been useful in trying out a car you suspected was a crock. The Ferrari Enzo, for example, wasn't worth half the money you paid for it, but there was no way to test it out and then get your money back.24.  The "Seasonal Tracks" require you to race with crummy cars or cars with a strict horsepower limit.25.  Why can't I paint my cars any color I want as many times as I want?  I have like a billion dollars!  Instead I have to "earn" paint!?  It's ridiculous!26.  There's some sort of bug (or other fun-ruining mechanism) whereby, in B-spec, your drivers don't get full credit for all the experience they accumulate.  This seems to happen about level 30.  You can put them through a 24-hour endurance race, and they'll only move up one level, not the several levels the raw points they've been given should net them.  Then, those excess points disappear somehow and are never counted.27.  There is (alas!) a rather serious bug that's started to plague the game starting with the patch that came out in December of 2011.  When you are in the camera view that allows you to see the back of your car, the frame will jolt a bit every time you go around a turn to re-center itself.  This only starts happenening after you reach about 10 laps of the same track, but it means that endurance races will give you a headache.28.  Er, howzabout warning me, before I spend more than 10 million on certain cars such as the Ferrari F1s that they cannot be used in normal races?  And that you're not allowed to sell them once you've bought them?  (As you can tell by this review, I played this game day and night for quite a while, but this was the thing that finally soured me on it and inspired me to write this cranky review.  Go, little review! Fly! May you decrease Polyphony's sales and cause them to go under!)In sum, it's a little difficult for me to believe I have so many complaints about this game, but I do.  What's not showing, of course, is that I really got into it and played it for weeks.  Hence despite all these gripes I confess that it is well worth the money.  Here's a couple of things I liked about it:1.  The game really gets you interested in racing history and you start reading a lot more about that subject.  That's gotta be considered a plus for a game.  This kinda starts when you're like, "Wait.  Why would a '69 Ford be going for 20 million?"2.  Initially I thought B-spec was the stupidest thing I ever saw.  Why would I want to watch the PlayStation play itself?  That was only until I realized you can set B-spec going while you went off to classes or to sleep and when you came back you'd have a whole bunch of money.  I admit I actually quite got into this:  it was oddly satisfying, heading off to work or wherever, knowing that you were kinda playing even though you weren't there.  It was a great opportunity to get a lot of other, real-life work done during this time.
Well I was one of those fans of the series who has been playing since the release of Socom 1.Like most people I felt the series fell off after Socom 2.Most people who enjoyed Socom 3 and CA were new comers who didn't know the difference and so they accepted the later games while the original fans left the series and the community crumbled.Socom Confrontation was supposed to be the return to greatness the original fans hoped for.We had all been dreaming of a next gen Socom to wipe out all the issues we had had on the PS 2 such as cheating and lag.The developers promised to return to the roots and restore the core gameplay of the earlier games in the series.They failed on so many levels.To make matters worse while saving some not so important core elements they changed the most important core elements that were directly related to giving this game the Socom feel or atmosphere.You're going to see alot of fanboys who love everything with Socom slapped on the cover drooling all over this game and encouraging you to purchase it which is very ill advised as most people aren't as easily impressed by just the Socom name alone.First issue is well documented,the server errors,logging on is a problem,consoles locking up is a problem,freezing while in the middle of a game is a problem,the problems at launch are far worse then the average launch title.Fanboys say "oh but wait for the patches that can be fixed".Ok so i will tell you know about the gameplay elements themselves that can't be fixed as I am 100% sure Slant 6 won't make patches for anything other then game errors.First off this game was built around OTS (over the shoulder view) and while it has a classic view the contols for classic view are seriously compromised because of the existance of OTS as the default.Plus classic view is not quite the same third person view we used to have,its zoomed in closer to your back (shows about waist up and doesn't show the whole body even in wide open parts of the map unless you look down at your feet.You now need to use motion controls to lean instead of the easy d-pad lean that was much more responsive.Motion controls are a gimmick to label it "next gen" and are never as precise as the simple push of a button.The reason d-pad controls are gone for classic view is that in night vision you are forced into OTS view and need d-pad controls to use for the OTS perspective,so yes they didn't exactly tell the truth when they said we would have a true classic view cause its a different third person perspective and OTS is still forced on you anytime you go into night vision.Gone also is first person perspective that you could use to see through windows and bushes.After having that view for urban warfare in past games you will see how sorely missed it is when you have the hampered view trying to shoot people from windows.Also you can't move the camera up that way to see out a bush so you pretty much have to crawl out of the bush and expose alot of your body to see,so much for hiding like a seal.The control set up is far less intuitive then it was before.The simple quick swap is gone and you must now stop playing and select your new weapon through a weapon wheel menu that hampers the fluidity of gameplay.throwing grenades can be done with a button but to get the furthest range you need to use motion controls and even then your max range is half what it used to be.On top of that the kill radius on grenades is non existant.Its literally like throwing firecrackers at the opponents.For every 4 grenades that land and explode right in the enemies lap you are lucky to get one kill.Most times grenades that blow up right at your feel take away no health at all.Gone is the old knockdown radius that would knock an opponent down and injure him if he was just out of the killzone but in shrapnel range.You either die or you don't no inbetween.The grenade system feels like it is more primitive then even the first Socom on the PS 2 which was made about 8 years ago.Nothing next gen about the grenades here it took steps backwards to the 16 bit era of video games.The lobby system is watered down from past games.The friends list is very generic no longer showing the room your friend is in or allowing you to join off the friends list.There are people already glitching so gone is the theory that PS 3 would bring a cheat free experience.Only time will tell if it can be fixed if they make good on promises to start banning people which will probably be on hold while they concentrate on the bugs first.No person in their right mind can say this is the best Socom yet.If success of this game rides on graphics alone then i can see some people praising this game as the graphics are a definite upgrade from the old Socoms.As far as all the other elements such as controls,gameplay,and the community/lobby features this game is a massive downgrade in every way.New people to the series and graphics fanatics seem to be the only ones claiming this is the best Socom ever.True Socom fans would never embarass themselves by making such a claim.I will say that when you can get into a game its better then Socom 3 and CA but Socom 1 and 2 overall are still by far the best games in this series.After seeing the finished product I wish they had just kept Zipper making the game and fired Seth Luisi as he is the real problem thats hurting the series.A remake of the old Socom 2 with better hit detection and graphics woudl have been a huge improvement over this game.Many will tell you "oh well it needed to evolve and change".I can understand that if the changes were taking the game forward but when a next gen system takes the game backwards in gameplay,controls,and lobby system I hardly see where that is evolving.I think people still praising this game are in severe denial and want to love this game cause its better then to accept that Socom has died.After the newness of the graphics and maps wears off i think they will realize the only real improvements were graphics and sound while everything else is a downgrade compared to Socoms 1 and 2.These are only some of the issues i could go on and on and right a whole book of stupid additions and omissions from this new Socom.Its so lacking that I am literally jaw dropping shocked at how some people claiming to be with the series since day 1 call this the best Socom yet.They had to have forgotten everything that made the old Socoms great or are simply to blinded by new pretty graphics to stop and notice everything thats been screwed up severely.Save your money and get RFOM 2 when it comes out.The first Resistance Fall of Man had a better server on their very first attempt and Sony has gone cheap lackluster servers for 5 straight Socoms now.I played the first RFOM to tide me over till Socom but after playing it RFOM is easily the better online game.Until we get a next gen Socom that truly goes back to its roots RFOM is the new king of online play for the PS 3 and the improvements I have already seen in the sequel coming next month just cement its spot all the more.If you are willing to sacrafice some realism for a fun game with a much smoother server to play with people all over the world the RFOM series is best all around.It took me awhile to adjust to RFOM as I loved Socom and the real military aspects but the gameplay has just fallen so far off its not the same Socom the original players knew and loved.
Sports games are, in some ways, the most difficult games to create, not because of the size of the world or the number of playable characters or what have you, but because unlike most other games, the world sports games attempt to recreate is familiar to all and is known in great detail, particularly for a sport like baseball. It's not difficult for even casual fans to check major details, and a dedicated fan can check things like single-season records or player career totals, so while you may have flexibility in the choices you give to players, the world you put them in is defined for you, and your job is to render it accurately.Something like 75% of this game is done with the care and detail that should be expected from an officially-licensed game: real teams playing in real parks (uh, mostly, although some features are mislabeled because they couldn't get the license or didn't want to pay for it, like the GM fountain in Comerica), infielders shifting uncomfortably from foot to foot as you circle the bases, baserunners flexing their hands as they take their leads ... lots of little details make you feel like you're part of an authentic MLB game.The other 25%, though ... either the playtesters were dismissed early or the project manager just ignored what they had to say, because the game is full of flaws that yank you roughly out of any immersion you may be feeling and remind you that you're playing a poorly-designed, poorly-developed game. The game is mostly free of game-breaking bugs, although I did have a series of crashes over the course of a few days, and there was one particularly amusing training session where I was hitting in provided situations, and the ball rebounded off the cage and out between the mound and home plate, so the pitcher was holding out his hand for the ball and the catcher refused to get it because it wasn't supposed to be there.The blown details, on the other hand, are impossible to miss. Watch the line score in Road To The Show: sometimes the inning-by-inning scores are put up as they happen, sometimes they don't show up until the inning is over, sometimes the zero shows up in the middle of the inning. The W-L record and ERA of the visiting team's pitcher is always 0-0 and 0.00; the home team's pitcher is always shown with 0 strikeouts. Here's a grounder to second for a fielder's choice, with the relay to first for the double play. (That's not a FC. A FC is a force of another runner when the batter reaches base; a double play is not a FC.) Or play one of the training sessions, where the result of each play or swing or pitch is shown, except when it's not, and the goal for each play is clear, except when it's not, and the results of each play are right, except when they're not. Throwing Decisions, for example, are only credited when you pre-select the base you're throwing to, so even if you make the "correct" decision, if you didn't do it early enough, it doesn't count. "Correct" is in quotes because what the game is expecting is not what people who've actually played the game would do in a particular situation, especially if you don't get any guidance from your manager. Bases loaded, 1 out, where are you going to throw the ball? If you said "home", you're wrong, because ... well, it doesn't tell you why. It just says that trying to stop the run from scoring is a bad decision. First and third with 2 out? Don't throw to first, that's a bad decision. Give me a break.Just as fun is getting a Steal 2B session when you're a corner infielder with middling speed. Not fast enough to steal? Too bad. Sure, you could get a fielding session instead - although I went nearly an entire season as a 3B without getting anything fielding-related - but why not train you in something that you don't really need yet? Never mind that it isn't actually Stealing 2B, but rather Steal 2B By Getting A Good Jump. If you leave early, but you end up getting to 2B anyway, it doesn't count, because that's not how they wanted you to do it.The post-play animations are kind of silly as well: your infielder insists on running off the field after an out, even if there were less than 2 outs. (And even if you're in training. What?) Of course, that's not really that important, because it's just for show. What is important is the incredibly stupid camera movement during play. This is actually common to all be-the-player games, the over-the-shoulder camera that always moves on its own and never lets you change it, but it's a real problem in this game when it comes to defense. Runners at 1st and 2nd, none out, ground ball to you at third, what do you do? In real life, you'd step on the bag. In MLB 13, you can't do that, because as soon as you pick up the ball, the camera spins to show you where it thinks you should throw the ball, and if you try to run to a base, it basically circles behind you, making you the drunk guy on the corner. Of course you could just press a button to run to the base ... except there's no way to do that. So there's no way to get the lead runner in that situation ... and worse yet, if you don't decide on a base, the game will start you running to where the play should be, and of course with somewhat-realistic physics, if you want to throw the ball, you have to set your feet, so instead of letting you stop and think what to do, it can actually prevent you from making a play.The other thing that presumably prevents you from making plays is the RPG aspect of this mode. It totally makes sense that for, say, baserunning skill to mean anything, if it's low, you have to struggle to run the bases, but it would be so much more helpful to have an icon flash on the screen when you try to round first on a line drive to the gap and your stupid player stops because second base is so far away or something like that. (It's worse when you're the lead runner and you end up backing up the other runners.) Without that feedback, there's no way to tell if you're doing something wrong, if there's a bug in the game, or if it's just because you're not good at running the bases. Speaking of baserunning ... what's more fun than having your player suddenly take off for home while the pitcher has the ball in his hand? It took several occurrences and a quick check of the settings for me to get that I wasn't doing it, say by touching the back screen (the default setting for that is disabled anyway), and you can learn to press X to stop your runner and move the stick down to get him back on base, but again, without something to tell you "your player is doing this because baserunning aggressiveness is too low" or whatever, it might as well be a bug.The manager doesn't make too many odd decisions, although he does insist on putting you behind the plate on rare occasions even if you don't have any catching experience. Fortunately, it does know not to put right-handed fielders at first ... oh, actually it doesn't. I've been inserted as a PH and then left at both 1B and 2B with a right-handed player. I know these modes tend to get you more action than you would as a normal player, but a right-handed 3B should be at LF, maybe RF if he has a good arm, and that's it.He doesn't make too many in-game suggestions, either. You'll get direction to play in, shade the line, or shift left or right for pull hitters (and I assume DP depth for 2B and SS), but on offense, nothing. No bunt sign, no hit-and-run sign, no steal sign. (There are 1B and 3B coaches, but they just give you stop and go signs when the ball is live.)There's more - and this is just from RttS mode, as I don't typically play the other modes - but I think you get the idea. If you're the type of person who doesn't mind nagging little bugs, then you'll probably have a good time with this game. If what you're looking for is a game that nails the picky little details as well as the overall game ... you're out of luck.
Several months back I was introduced to Ninja Theory's work through Enslaved: Odyssey to the West.  Despite the plummeting price point typically indicative of gaming mediocrity, I found Enslaved wholly intriguing and masterfully crafted.  After discovering that Andy Serkis had also contributed to Heavenly Sword's cinematic and narrative development I decided to immediately make a purchase.Heavenly Sword took me about 6 hours to complete on the normal setting.  6 hours in itself may seem like a valid reason for lowering a review score, but (surprisingly) it does not factor into my scoring.  I have always been a fan of quality over quantity.  The problem is that the game ultimately falls into 3 hours of arena battle sword fights, 1/2 hour of arena/quick-time boss fights, 1/2 hour of cinematics, and 2 hours of sinaxis slow-motion cannon/arrow shooting.For the most part, the characters are very engaging with strong individualized personalities and interesting dialogue.  The narrative often falls more into bouts of witty dialectic than substantial plot driven revelations, but the presentation is so strong that it still draws in the viewer.  Even 4 years later (with the exception of Nariko's squid-like hair) the facial features are stunning.  Facial animations and expressions are still light-years ahead of another game I recently reviewed: Dead Space 2.  The game's "menu" screen that opens after the first battle has some MAJOR lip synch issues, but these are corrected in every other cinematic.  The  scenes with Bohan yelling at his son (who looks like Sloth from the Goonies) and Flying Fox preaching his sadistic ideas about style while prancing like the Flash are definitely entertaining.  The problem is that even 30 min of great cinema does not draw me back into the 5-1/2 hours that make up the rest of this game.Almost every battle is broken into a room, arena, hallway, or enclosed road and does not allow you to progress until all enemies are defeated within that section.  Environments are beautifully rendered, but ultimately all look similar in design and color.  Enemies only come in about 6 varieties of soldier types.  More importantly is that  the only major difference when facing enemies is how often they block, how many hits they take to kill, and how often they strike with "unblockable attacks."  Without exception enemies just don't feel unique like they do in other action games.  The combat system also doesn't do much to keep the game from feeling repetitive.The Heavenly Sword can be used in three different styles: Speed, Power and Ranged.  Each style has its own set of combo attacks and by holding R1 (power), L1 (ranged) or no shoulder button (speed) you can combine combos with the square (regular) and triangle (hard) attacks.  The game actually has a multitude of combos to use.  The problem is that, despite changing the style, every combo is just a combination of square and triangle.  So, depending on which style you use you are still using combos that look like [] ^ [] [] ^ or ^^^ or [] [] [] [] ^.  When you don't touch any buttons Nariko will block a "blue" attack.  Pressing triangle during an attack will trigger a lethal counter.  Since you are stringing together so many combos only using a few buttons, you ultimately end up button mashing combos and keeping different styles in mind.  A typical fight works like this:  (L1 ranged-  HAMMER DOWN THE BUTTONS, R1 power - HAMMER DOWN THE BUTTONS TO KILL THE POWERFUL ENEMY,  roll away, roll away, no button for speed - HAMMER DOWN TRIANGLE TO HIT AND TRY TO INITIATE A COUNTER KILL).  I'm sure that somebody could try to memorize each and every combo to try and use it in the best way possible, but it became an exercise in tedium for me.  Mashing buttons while using different styles depending on the enemy type took me to the end of the game with only 2 deaths.  Rolling to avoid "red" attacks also becomes difficult because you cannot stop a combo mid sequence.  Pressing NO buttons to block a "blue" attack is almost ridiculous because you're almost always mid-combo on an attack when you see an enemy light up.  Quite honestly all of the rolling, flipping, spinning and slicing through enemies began to make me feel nauseous.  The environments, enemies, and attacks all seem so similar you lose focus on what you're doing and begin to see a blur on the screen.  The sinaxis controls are even worse.Now I know some people will love controlling the cannon shots and arrows with the sinaxis.  The controls are actually decent using the motion controller and have a novelty to them.  The problem is that the blur effect used around the object in flight, together with the slow-motion ups and downs of your path are UGGH...NAUSEATING.  I have never felt like this in a game before, and dismissed several of the reviews here on Amazon that mentioned people feeling sick after these sections.  Well, after about an hour of using the motion control I found it could be disabled and you could use the analog to steer.  That helped a lot with the swaying to hit your target with motion control, but the slow-motion blur effect was still awful.  The real problem is that the character you "usually" use for these sections (Kai- the mentally disturbed cat hat girl) can only shoot enemies or jump over them.  The levels are extremely bare and offer only a few barrels to shoot with flaming arrows.  You have to guide the arrow through fire and onto its target to ignite the gunpowder, which results in more boat rocking action.The ending battle was the highlight of the action and was actually quite engaging.  Aside from 2 very short sequences, it also didn't feature a string of 1 second quick time events to memorize like other bosses.  Ultimately Heavenly Sword is best described as an experience with extremely tedious gameplay juxtaposed with AAA visuals and cinematics.  Maybe it will be enough for you, but 30 min of great video was not enough for me to warrant keeping this game in my collection.  I can watch any of the Lord of the Rings to see 3 hours of Andy Serkis doing some great voice acting and motion-capture.  Ninja Theory is a very talented company, as my review of Enslaved notes,  I just hope they keep  diversity (and lack of motion controls) in mind for the reboot of Devil May Cry.  (6.9/10)
I know I'm pretty late with this review, but I only just now managed to force myself to finish the game.  I'll get it right out in the open here at the start.  Resistance: Burning Skies is an insult to this otherwise incredible franchise.  Through it's mercifully paltry six-level campaign, it does manage to get a few things right, but there's so much that goes wrong!  If I had to describe the game in one word, this is what I'd say: amateurish.  Nihilistic Software (now called nStigate Games) seems to either have no interest in learning how to make a proper game, or they're still new.  Judging by the fact that this is their sixth game since 2000, I'd say it's the former.  I'm kind of in shock that Sony (and later, Activision) would hand over IP's that are so high-profile to a developer like this whose track record clearly shows they have no idea what they're doing.  Anyway, I digress.  Resistance.Let's start with the good.  This game's best assets are the controls and the musical score.  The PlayStation Vita is the first portable handheld to sport dual analog sticks, and it absolutely rocks.  This game controls like a dream, and truly shows what the Vita is capable of achieving with first-person shooters from a control standpoint.  Even the touch controls are well-implemented...not intrusive, and without that "tacked on" feeling.  Since the Vita still lacks the DualShock's L2/R2 buttons, using your weapon's secondary fire is mapped to the touchscreen.  It works extremely well, and it really surprised me.  The dreaded rear touchscreen is barely used (thankfully), being resorted to the sprint controls.  Simply tap the rear touchscreen twice and your character is running.  Simple and easy.  The soundtrack to the game is miles above the rest of it.  Play using headphones and the fully-orchestrated music truly takes on a life of its own.  Kudos to Nihilistic for not skimping here.Now, the bad...let's start with presentation.  Nihilistic can't seem to figure out how to make attractive interfaces.  From the title screen to the menus, everything looks like a pre-rendered background.  Static and unattractive.  Their prior game, PlayStation Move Heroes, had the exact same issue.  It's just lifeless and ugly, and fails to make a good first impression for the game.  Next, the cheap cutscenes.  The first thing you notice is how horribly compressed they are.  They look like YouTube videos being played over a 56K modem.  Do you want subtitles?  Fine...the subtitles are shown in front of a HUGE darker translucent rectangle that covers an unnecessarily large portion of the already-unattractive picture.  Plus they're not cinematic, and more like slideshows.  And then there's one of the many ultimate sins of modern gaming: the cutscenes are unskippable.  Every time you boot up the game, the cutscene has to play in its entirety, and they're not very short.  The same applies to any in-engine cutscenes that happen throughout the level.  If the game decides to do a checkpoint before a scene, then you die before the next checkpoint, you get to hear the entire conversation over again with no option to skip.  This is especially infuriating when you get to the fairly-challenging final boss.  Then, there's the graphics.  The Vita's OLED screen manages to save some of it, but for the most part everything looks bland and rough.  Textures are pretty much missing for most of the game.  The sound effects are weak, sounding more cheap than ever.  Compared to the PS3 games, this is a massive disappointment.Then, there's progression issues.  This is a portable game, yet save points are extremely scarce.  While checkpoints are evenly placed, actual saves are few and far between.  The last 45 minutes of the game have to be done in one sitting.  Thank goodness the Vita allows for suspending gaming sessions and standby.  How it should've been was having each checkpoint serve as a save point like the console games.  The levels are, for the most part, repetitive and bland.  Enemy AI is ridiculously stupid and firefights generally consist of waves of 3 or 4 stupid enemies at once.  You might get multiple waves of them, but each is as uninspiring and unexciting as the next.  Also, the upgrade system is completely not well thought-out either.  To upgrade a weapon, you need grey matter...little grey cubes found throughout the game.  Each weapon has six possible upgrades in two groups of three.  You can assign grey matter to only one upgrade from each group per weapon.  So, with only six weapons, it's not long before you max out each one.  Yet, you keep finding grey matter...the stuff is plentiful!  So after the third level there's really no point in seeking out upgrades, because you can't do any more.  At least the weapons themselves do an admirable job of living up to the console games.  The game actually picks up ONLY during the final level.  This level is actually pretty fantastic, and if the rest of the game were as tense and exhilarating it would be great!Finally, the story.  No effort has been taken to make the player truly care about the protagonist's plight.  You're on a quest to save you wife and daughter from the Chimera.  But along the way you meet a resistance group...some sort of rogue militia...and you help them as well.  The characters are flat and lack any sort of personality, and you don't get a real sense of urgency.What really makes my heart ache with this game is when you compare it to Resistance's previous portable outing...Resistance: Retribution for PSP.  That game, developed by Sony Bend, managed to capture the atmosphere of the series perfectly.  Not only that, on this lesser console, the developers threw tons of enemies at you at once and the entire game was just nonstop adrenaline.  Retribution featured fully-rendered cutscenes, great voice acting, a protagonist you cared about and tons of level variety.  It's just sad that Burning Skies just seems like a gargantuan step backward.So yeah, my recommendation is that you skip this entry entirely.  It's just not a good game, and completely fails as a Resistance game.  But if you have a Vita, Resistance: Retribution is fully playable on it, so I'd definitely recommend that (especially since you can map the camera control to the right stick).  Nihilistic Software went on to make Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified for the Vita, and that game tanked even harder than this one.  This prompted them to change their name to nStigate Games, with the goal to abandon console games for smaller mobile titles.  That right there should give you a good idea what to expect.
Right up front, I'll point out the three most obvious things about GT5 Prologue.1. It looks gorgeous2. The AI is abominable.3. There is still no car damage.To use a lovely english expression : it's all mouth and no trousers. Look past the HD graphics and hype and you'll find Gran Turismo 1 lurking here.The Gran Turismo games are known for their accurate car handling and fantastic graphics, and GT5 Prologue is no exception. The problem is that it is all absolutely ruined by the other driver AI. Previous Gran Turismo titles have never exactly shone when it comes to the AI, but in GT5 it's simply non-existent. It's not that the AI is dumb, it's just not there. The other cars all drive on rails, irrespective of where you are. For example, on the High Speed Ring circuit - there's a challenge to get from the back of the pack to the front in a single lap. In the car they give you, it is 100% impossible to come any higher than 3rd, and that's a stretch. The driving-on-rails is so accurate and predictable that you can actually predict exactly where every car will be at any given point. You'll come up behind the Ford Focus at the end of the second turn, and don't even think about passing him on the outside because he will always jink to the left for no reason as he goes across the bridge. If you're in the way, then tough. The game will just force you off the track. At the next corner, the Mazda 6 will always follow the identical line inside the corner, again irrespective of whether you're there.The same is true in the other types of race. Within minutes of playing this game, you will find yourself making a tidy corner only to have a much faster car come right up behind you and ram you off the track because you're in the way of it's pre-programmed line. To see how truly awful it is, start a race at the back and watch the 15 cars in front of you. They'll all cut the same corner in the same way, every lap, all with the identical puff of dirt as they do it.It is simply abominable.The problem is that this issue was solved long ago by the likes of - well - just about every other racing franchise out there. It's compounded by the fact that there is still no car damage or dirt in GT5. You can stuff any car into a concrete armco at 175mph and it will simply bounce off without so much as a scratch. To think that Polyphony could put out a game with no car damage and ruinous AI on a next-gen console in 2008 just boggles the mind given how accomplished the competition is (think: Project Gotham Racing).So what about the eye-candy aspect? Well - it runs at 1080p (full HD) and it looks absolutely spectacular. The textures are crisp and don't blur out at highly obtuse angles like they would on an X-Box. The car models are beautiful as are the various effects like the real-time reflections and the colour-flip paint jobs. There is some aliasing on high-contrast areas but detail popup is minimal. There are very noticable level-of-detail swaps on some of the cars where they swap from a low detail to a high detail version. It's most noticable on the Daytona circuit where you'll occasionally see the shading on the back of a car pop noticably as the model swaps to it's higher resolution version. In fact the eye-candy aspect is only marred slightly be the fact that the game clearly doesn't run at 60 frames per second. Well - it does on sparsely populated tracks but in the thick of the action on some circuits, you'll see noticable slowdown which you just shouldn't have on a console as powerful as a PS3.What other things to know about? Well the online aspect of the game has a lot of promise but it's buggy at best. If your PS3 isn't set up pefectly on a broadband network (NAT type 1) it just won't connect to the servers. If you're lucky enough to have a good setup, then even when it does connect, the racing is a bit dodgy. It's obvious that the sample rate for your system communicating with all the others is fairly slow as you'll often see your opponents cars jump across the circuit from one side to the other, or suddenly appear to brake or accelerate at light speed as the servers catch up.When you come to use the game for the first time, be prepared for a long wait. It seems to copy the entire blu-ray disc on to the internal hard drive which takes a good 15 minutes, then as soon as you connect, it will download a huge update which will take 5 to 10 minutes to download and another 5 minutes to install. So out-of-the-box to first race is about 30 minutes. That seems a bit odd to me - I was entirely expecting the game to run off the disc like many of the other PS3 titles.So GT5 Prologue : it's great eye-candy, sure. But the two biggest, most long-standing problems with the GT franchise are still present. Awful AI and no car damage. The press previews and talk from Polyphony indicate that the full game will have car damage, but historically, they've never been known to change their underlying game engines between the 'Prologue' and the full versions of GT. They have always claimed that they've fixed the AI with each successive version of the game, but honestly - GT5 Prologue has taken a massive step backwards. They say it's better than ever but it's actually worse than ever. So when they say there will be car damage in the full game, I say 'cry wolf' I'm afraid.It's an ominous omen for GT5 later this year. Sure it'll have more cars and more tracks. But chances are it will have the same problems the GT franchise has always had, and that's simply not good enough. Couple that with the questionable frame rate and online problems and that could be disastrous.I dearly love the GT  franchise - I've had every one of them and I've been hoping and praying that they would one day fix the AI problems and the lack of car damage. If they've not done it on the PS3, then it's just never going to happen, and that is a sad indictment of Polyphony's marketing strategy. I've played this game a lot, desperately wanting to like it but I always put the controller down and am left with an empty feeling. It's just not exciting.
I've been a gamer now for about 18 years. I've played plenty of games on all types of platforms. I love my PSP as I can take my habit anywhere and get my fix. There have been many games put out for the PSP so far, some really good, and some horrible. Having finished Untold Legends - Brotherhood of The Blade, I was looking for another fun game, but something more current. On searching, I found two games, one of which was Resistance. I always thoroughly read all reviews to get a general feel for the game and what others think about it. I have to say, most got it wrong with this game.On receiving the game, I read through the manual. I was disappointed straight out of the box. The first thing I look for when searching for a game is if the controls are PSP friendly, and that means, that character movement is completely controlled by the analog stick. Most reviews said that is how the character is controlled in this game. Wrong. On reading the manual, I find that only forward and side to side character control is afforded by the analog stick, and to turn the character you have to use the triangle, circle, square, X pads in conjunction with the analog stick. This was exactly what I wanted to avoid because games that are not modified from the two analog stick control format of the PS2 and PS3 suck on the PSP because you don't have enough fingers to both control the character AND select weapons, AND aim, AND fire at the same time. Proper control on land should be totally by analog stick.I gave the game a run for its money. I'll be honest, the graphics and art work are excellent, and the story line is interesting. Sounds and music what little there is are very well done. But as one progresses through the levels it becomes increasingly difficult and then impossible to adequately control the character. This first becomes apparent when you try to swim the first time. You get an indicator to press down arrow to dive. OK, fine he goes under the water then what? You have to move the analog stick forward, but if you need to dive further, you have to press the down arrow again, hard to do when your using that hand to move forward. Turning is a joke as you attempt to use the Square and Circle buttons while pushing the analog stick. Down arrow will get you down under and diving, the up arrow button is all but useless as you die, lost and hopelessly disoriented as you've lost all sense of direction. Just to ice the cake they toss in a few Screachers later to attack you while you drown. Frustrating. The proper control set up for swimming should have been forward movement by analog stick and up, down, left, right by the symbol keys.As you progress you naturally encounter more and more enimies. Most of the earlier enimies are fairly easy, and ammo seems plentiful. Eventually you'll cross paths with an enimie called a Boiler. These lovely creatures look like the aliens you saw in the movie Independence Day. They have thick skin though so you have to shoot them forever to kill them. That uses up all or most of your ammo. The idea is, you shoot them in the head and their head explodes killing them. If you fail to do this, they explode their head of their own accord next to you taking away health. Problem, you cannot maneuver and aim and shoot at the same time because your both hands are having to control the character. You get used to shooting at the same time by pressing the R button, but unless you aim with these guys, be prepared to get blown up. Whoops, cannot aim, using that hand to do two other things, sorry. BOOM! This is a recurring major problem that only gets worse as you play along farther into the game. More enimies, less control, more of you dying instead of them. Half the time your out of ammo, even if you pick most or all of it up that you come across, which is pretty easy to do. Health is usually fairly plentiful, but there are some areas they could have cut you a break and laid one in a corner. There are some campaigns where you don't have any health options, you have to beat the gazillions of enimies overwhelming you or you die first. Again frustrating.Another poor design cue is with the weapons. There are plenty of weapons to use, and you get most of them in the beginning campaigns. Ammo is fairly plentiful, but because of control issues, you waste so much of it, you find yourself defenseless with useless empty weapons most of the time. A real problem is that each gun has different abilities, and dual capabilities. One for example is a regular gun in default mode, but acts as a grenade launcher in the other mode. The problem is, you have to aim the grenade and most of the time your needing to move while doing it. So that means your left hand is on the analog stick and your right hand is on the symbol keys, and they expect you to move, seek cover, and fire using your right button, but if you want to use the alternate weapon mode you have to press the left button, hold it then press the right button. So unless your a danged octopus, your not using the alternate weapons often. The other frustrating thing is, you eventually learn that for example the LAARK has some pretty good power. So you decide to select it, would you not think that a well designed game would display a tiny box or something with the gun name shown as your selecting weapons? Maybe the ability to press a button to refresh you memory as to what the selected weapon can do. Yes, you would expect that, but not in this game. Your on your own, all you get is a small icon, so unless you can recall in the heat of a battle while getting your butt blown off what the LAARK looked like, your SOL and DEAD.In the end this game was nothing but a lesson in total frustration. I did not enjoy playing it at all. Every turn was a struggle to control the character and stay alive only to die because the controls flat out suc'd. Designers of games like this where they are too lazy to change the control functions to PSP friendly should be put out of a job, there is no excuse for that type of poor planning and design. I can fully understand now why this game in spite of all of the glowing reviews was marked down to $14.99, still $14 too high in my opinion. Do not waste your time or hard earned money on this turd, buy God Of War first, now that is an incredible game.
The key bad points in this game are:1:Way too much grinding and farming2:semi decent graphics just slightly better than ps23:boring music but just below average4:It has some nice armor and weapons textures but not much differences between them expect new armor and weapons may look worst than what your wearing and it takes too long to make them in the item creation, to make all of them could take over a year of boring grind/farming. Possibly over 900-3000 hours of gameplay is a big turn off for me.If you go online to the game servers its a scam, the amount of time consumed when playing online is ridiculous the farming is hard the amount of rewards are rare and if you go on DLC psn network you know why, all the DLC combined is over 100 $150+ buy this and that such as increased drop rates, and have it lasts for 30 days only, a lot of the best gaming is supposed to be done online but at a high price, the game is a 2/5 at best such a game should not be so hard to play online with all that grinding, You've been warned its a serious grind game just as bad as world of warcraft, I'm a hardcore gamer but this game White knight chronicles is only just okay offline. The moment i went online i was scammed out of so many hours spent and only little reward to be had. A lot of people reviewing this come from the game company themselves. Trust a real person a real gamers review, I will say this offline it has some fun to be had with it, go through a half decent storyline your main character remains silent and boring throughout the story which doesn't make sense, its very anti-climactic for all those hours u could spend creating your character is only useful online.So when you do go online your whole world changes you have to grind and farm even more than a typical hardcore gamer is used to, I gave up playing this online as the game isn't good enough to promote such grinding and rare drop farming. Just to make your gear/outfit/armor that overall has better stats than what your wearing but lacks in style and appearance, such as I'm wearing a cool armor and weapon but I make or find something that has way better stats than what you already have on, just kills the whole point in spending hours farming and grinding to make the new piece or armor and weapon look really shabby and crap all that time spent to look more ruined in the game???A lot of people stopped playing this game so the community online is dying, I'm sure this is because of the lack of game mechanics to keep you playing, this is what happens when you force people to spend more than 300 hours doing nothing but rare item hunting which does nothing but waste your time. Imagine this going out looking for groups to do a quest for rare monster drops, you spend some time getting a group then you all go out together when you go through the level and kill the end boss say spending 1-2 hours or more in it and the boss doesn't drop the necessary material thats needed to make a piece of armor or weapon? You catch my point in games like this thats not an MMORPG massively multi-player online rpg all boss drops should be once defeated a 100% drop rate so people can work on other pieces of gear instead of farming the same one over n over. A note to the developers this game isn't an MMORPG so don't try to emulate the grinding and farming on doing the same repetitive quests over n over.The game is full of materials and a lot of them cost a lot of time and money to get, and the game isn't rewarding when you kill enemies you do not end up with much money at the end and mats you have to grind for a long time to get quantity of them just enough to build the next armor/weapon. The music in the game is just below average, the storyline super cliche, The graphics are just slightly better than Playstation 2 quality, the only thing thats decent is the texture of the armor and weapons, but most of them are too similar in design and only have different designs on them so really I'm going to farm 400 hours just to get another piece of armor thats worst looking has better stats than my good looking armor and weapons and with slightly different characteristics? No thank you. I completed the game and the sequel because I'm one of those hardcore gamers even though I don't like a game if i find something of small interest in it I will continue to play it till i finish it, but that damn online mode that kills out your psn wallet for little reward isn't worth it or the time spent in building the rest of your gameplay. The problem is you have to go online to get the chance to make all your weapons and armor as some quests you need help from other people to complete. Having to spend months to a year or so on one game... that to me is just super lame.If you want a decent RPG that will last you a decent time without the process of involving a 400-500+ hours of pointless grinding/farming avoid this game at all cost trust me you will thank me.I miss the days of Grandia, Final fantasy 6-7-8-X, Xenogears, Chrono Trigger, Secret of mana, Star ocean 2, Valkyrie Profile, Zelda 1, 3 and Ocarina of time just to name a few top ones there. So you guys know I'm for real a hardcore rpg fan since the release of Zelda 1 NES and even further back Heavy on the magic keyboard adventure game on the Amstrad.
Ok, let me start of by saying: I have played dozens of tactical shooters in my life, Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield would have to be the best shooter I've played (online & single player). So I understand how they work...but this game just utterly fails as a tactical-shooter from the start.INSTALLATION:How you ask? Well, for one - once you open the game and pop the disc in, it automatically starts. So what you say? Not when a message tells you, you need to QUIT THE GAME and install it from your XMB...why would they make a game, once you start up you have to quit and install it separately? I mean I don't mind installs, BUT why couldn't they have just made the install while in the game? Doesn't make sense if you ask me, especially since the install is 2 GBs long! But that's nothing too bad, unless you need conserve space. So after that you need to install the patch, which is where the extra 1GB comes from (3GB are needed for the game)...all in all it took about an hour or so and it was 1:00 AM when I finished all that...now comes even more failure...SERVERS:The servers would have to be one of the worst. They tried to make the server lobbies like other PC games, but the thing is this is PS3, you cannot mix PC with PS3. It takes a while to join a game, and at times you can't join a channel - it would tell you that it failed to join and you need to join foreign channels (Japan etc)...you think that's bad? Not even close.GAMEPLAY:The game play is not the worst I have encountered but it is BAD. It is it too slow. Most tactical-shooters are somewhat what you would call slow, but the game play in this is TOO SLOW. There are too many button configurations to do one simple thing. Aiming is a pain, there are 3 types of zoom, but it doesn't work - it's pointless. To switch weapons is also annoying, you can only switch 2 weapons ON-OFF with the L1 button, but to switch to grenades or your secondary weapon you have to hold O move with the D-Pad on what you want, and release O while holding the D-Pad button. What a great concept, especially when you run out of out of ammo and switch and your grenades come up instead of your handgun (while getting shot at) [/sarcasm] - that just takes up too much time! Grenade tossing is a joke, it's like I said, SLOW and the blast is so weak, hardly anyone would die with the grenades you throw at them...The reticule is also a disappointment; when you start shooting your crosshairs jumps all over the place, you cannot really get a steady aim - not even when you are still. And not just that but the 3rd person view just gets in the way...the camera is too close to your character and when you have your crosshairs to the left-right your guy will get in the way the person you are shooting and can't see where he is at; this mostly happens when he is close to you. What a joke! You can also peek left/right by moving the SIXAXIS, but what's the point? It doesn't work with 3rd person shooters like this. Not to mention the response is slow, turning around is a pain since most of the time when I die I get shot from behind and to turn around takes forever, by the time I do I'm already dead. Not to mention there too many glitches in this game, there is lag but nothing too bad just getting in the game sucks. Although the game play is bad, I ended up getting used to it and it was somewhat "fun" playing at first, then I got disconnected after an hour playing because of "server-maintenance" -- what a crock. Then there are the maps:The maps are too big for the style of the game, too little people hiding and too much time is wasted looking for someone. The spawn points are also ridiculous, you can easily get spawn raped. Not to mention the maps are terribly designed, which moves onto the next flaw.GRAPHICS/TEXTURES:Ok, I usually don't care for graphics in a game, to me it's all about gameplay / story - but since the game play wasn't anywhere near good. I have to look at graphics, which aren't that great either. In fact, SOCOM looks like a beefed up PS2 game. Heck, a majority of PS2 games look much better than this. The texture for the maps were bad, looked really crummy and there was so little detail in the game...I don't know what the real resolution of the game was but I was running it in 1080p and the game still looked choppy.BLUETOOTH HEADSET:You probably already know the game comes with a bluetooth headset, which is awesome at first but somewhat pointless. No one in the game really uses it except clans. I only used it once, and that was in another game. But other than that, it's good to have so you can use on your cell phone - which is exactly how I am going to use mine. The headset is a very sleek design, very cool and not bulky or ugly like other headsets.CONCLUSION:Overall, SOCOM: Confrontation is not the worst game for PS3; with it's outdated, confusing, slow gameplay and choppy graphics...it is pretty bad. Let's just put it this way, Ghost Recon 2 for PS3 was far more worse than this.The game fails to interest, there is nothing new at all. And like I said, it's bad gameplay would probably make you want turn the game off. The sad thing about this is that this was Christmas gift from my brother in which I told him the game was decent the first day I played it, and it was true it WAS decent at first, and within a period of 3 days I have come to dislike the game but NOT hate it...I would probably not pick up and play the game again anytime soon.I would not really recommend this game for a friend or as a gift to someone, it's a game you should RENT before thinking of buying it. In the end, this game fails as a tactical-shooter...they wanted a PC-like-game for the PS3 but it didn't succeed, this is another fail on SONY's part.
I love RPGs. The PS2 has produced some really excellent games for the genre including Final Fantasy X, the Shadow Hearts series, and Disgea: Hour of Darkness. Wild Arms 3 is not going to be joining this list of RPG awesomeness any time soon. It's not even going to be joining my list of decent RPGs. This game is terrible, and I just could not finish it! Trust me I tried and there was a period of two weeks when I couldn't bring myself to even turn the game on.I thought a western-themed RPG would be something really unique, but I was wrong. This has got to be one of the most cliched things I've ever seen. It's the third in a series that appears to be rather popular. I did end up hating this game, but strangely I'm not totally put off from playing a Wild Arms game ever again. Maybe since this is the third game, it's just an unfortunate casuality of sequel-itis.The Good:The music's pretty good. It's appropriately whistlely and twangy like the fare you'd find in most spagetti westerns and really sets the western tone.Fighting on horseback! This only unique from a visual point of view. The game still plays in exactly the same turn-based Final Fantasy-esque way as if you were on foot, but it looks really cool as you race across the desert fending off creepies.Save Anywhere! You can provided you have an item called a Gimel Coin, but luckily those are easy to find.The Bad:Cliched plot. It starts out with promise. Your four heroes meet up during a train robbery when some burly gunmen try to steal an artifact belonging to this Indian Shaman tribe called the Baskars. Classic Western! Then the adventurers, called Drifters, team up and take an assignment from the Baskar's head Shaman to awaken the four guardians of the planet Filgaia so maybe the desertification of the planet will stop. It's down hill from there. Suddenly, instead of a Western game, I'm playing a cliched find the four scared elemental crystals/dragons/betamax VCRs quest.... but with firearms! Soon our foursome discovers that this weird demon cult is out to infuse the planet with evil energy and transform it into a demon world or some other rot by using guardians and ancient artifacts. So they set out, to discover why Filgaia is dying and play follow-the-bad guys. It's almost like playing Final Fantasy VII over again, and I never liked that game much in the first place.Characters that come right out of anime central casting. The characters are very archetypal and never try to break out of their mold. You have Gallows, a ne'er-do-well Shaman, who learns some bland lesson on freedom, heritage, and self-actualization on the journey. Brainy, tough guy Clive, who might have been a better drawn character if his marital troubles were explored in more detail. Jet Enduro, surly anti-social amnesiac, and worst of the bunch Virginia Maxwell. For some reason they make her their leader even though she is the least expirenced of the bunch. She's naive, gulliable, and not all that smart trusting people she should know better than to trust and walking into obvious traps. She's one of those annoyingly perky types and her "Come on guys! Let's do our best for Justice, Truth, and blah blah" is more Big Bird than Clint Eastwood. She's also looking for the dead-beat dad she hasn't seen in 10 years. The anime feel is helped along by the video sequences (complete with corny songs) that sandwich the game when you begin and end it during each period of play. Trust me. It's frickk'n annoying after you've seen them ten times.Sandcraft battles. During the game you get a sandcraft vehicle. If you run into a monster in this thing, the way the battles plays out is very different than on foot or horseback. That's not good because they battles are so bloody slow that they can last for over five minutes each!The Ugly:Healing Items are hard to find. Healing Items are scarce, so it becomes neccesary to ration stretigically. There are some sections of the game that are so hard that having a big cache of heal berries is the only way to stay alive. It adds challenge, but since I didn't enjoy the game it just it that more annoying.Search system. If you want to find something on the map, you need to get directions first and move slowly across the map sending out some kind of sonar to make the ruin, town, or whatever appear. It's time consuming and also makes the game extremely linear.Boring Level Design. You'll send more of you're time trekking through the various ruins that litter the landscape. In the ruins, you solve various puzzles ranging from easy to what am I supposed to do here? difficulty. A critic once said level design was key, and Wild Arms 3 makes me see how right he was. All the ruins look exactly the same. I know I'm throwing a switch in the ruin in the North, but I did the exact same thing in the ruin to the South which also had a box puzzle like the ruin in the West.  Get my point? It feels like I'm doing the same thing over and over again. I'm not traveling to a Forest of Doom or a Cloud City of Eternal Happiness. It's just ruins and towns, and they all look the same!

I'm sorry, I cant slap on the kudos that the other Syphon Filter die hards did for this version. I thought Syphon Filter 1 was the best console game available when it came out, Period. Really good first person action and controls that were superbly responsive.Syphon Filter 2 came on 2 CDs and was truly massive with lots of well thought out sections and excellent challenges.Syphon Filter 3 is exactly what I said it is. A series of OK to Lame leftovers they didn't think were worth including in 1 and 2.In case you didn't know, the company that produced one and two sold out before three and it is completely obvious that the people who cludged together 3 were using the leftovers.One and two broke a lot of new ground and the increased scale of two alone justifies it, but 3 does nothing new and is kind of like one of those Death Wish 13 movies. They really should have stopped at two in this case. This even came in a 2 cd box (with only one CD and a lame little meaningless pamphlet)They obviously had more planned, but decided just to exploit Syphon Filter fans instead, [taking money] out of them before they learned the truth.Sorry Guys, your first two were great, but this one is pure financial exploitation.MGS2 on the PS2 is intriguing, but really wordy and a little strained in the control department even if you don't like true first person as much as I do.However, Halo on the Xbox is the new best console shooter, Period!Played through Heroic level, hard but great fun. Legendary is continuous Suicide, also Period.If you like shooters, it is time to move on.

I thought I wasted my time writing a review on this crap, but apparently not.  I played it for about an hour and wanted to get rid of it the same day.  Syphon Filter used to be a sure thing, but now it's up the creak without a paddle.  The controls suck, the mission objectives are unclear, and the map is hard to read.  I'd swear the developers that made the previous Syphon Filter editions enjoyable retired and passed on the torch to the makers of "No One Lives Forever."  That game is as fun as having your your legs broken twice a year, every year, for 10 years straight.  I'd give this game 1/2 star if it were possible.

This is Sony's showcase of what the PS4 can do. It has pretty good graphics but that is it. It is very repetitive and has a very boring and generic story. I guess anyone can slap a new name on a game and improve the visuals and call it a new game and make lots of money. Pure disappointment!

Dark Cloud is a Zelda/Actraiser hybrid that seems to try too hard to be perfect on the town buidling part and neglects some things in the dungeon battles. For one, having to throw powder on your weapon to keep it from breaking is stupid. What idiot thought that idea up? Plus the weapon building system is long and complex and not really explained well enough. They should just have better weapons lying in treasure chests as you go along.

Why spend [money] on something that does NOTHING for you except possibly make your PS2 look better.  The PS2 is in no danger of falling over when it in horizontal, so whats the point of putting it verticle, now you controller ports detract from the look even more than having it horizontal.

One general word of advice.  Whenever you see a game that says &quot;randomly generated dungeons&quot;.........run.  A few high profile failures have tried this, (Anarchy Online anyone?).  The problem with random dungeons is just that........the whole game seems random.  There is no sense of fighting thru the underlings, to get to the &quot;boss&quot;.  Yes there is a boss at the end of every dungeon, but there is no progression that's immersive.The graphics are also very &quot;cutesy&quot;.  This is a good game for children under 12 or so, would be a nice first &quot;RPG&quot; for someone, but for serious gamers it becomes very boring very quickly.By far the most &quot;fun&quot; to be had in this game is goofing around arranging the towns you have to put back together.  Unfortunately, most of your time is spent in random dungeons, fighting random mobs, and it all begins to look the same VERY quickly.Rental only

Strange how some people regard Grandia as the best Saturn RPG and one of the best on the PlayStation. While Grandia possesses some interesting qualities, it is completely dismantled by a series of devastating flaws that cripple the game. This review will be formulaic, but it will get the point across.The graphical engine was very good. 2D characters and 3D environments that can be rotated at will. I like nuances, and Grandia possesses many. I like knocking over teapots and making clotheslines as I walk into them. The spell effects were boring, however, and the FMV, while technically good at the time, just wasn't exciting.The music is overwrought and almost silly. The main themes seem bombastic and pretentious, as if the game is saying, &quot;Come look at me, I'm important!&quot; The compositions are impressive musically, but they feel emotionally hollow. There is one song, a piano &amp; violin duet, which I loved. It was completely gorgeous. I also liked how the combat music changed as the game continued. RPGs often frustrate me by giving me the same combat music through the entire 40 hour game.In Grandia, using specific kinds of magic or weapons makes you more skilled in that capacity. Naive gamers have said that Grandia's character growth system is innovative and interesting. It is not innovative, in my mind, and not interesting. Such systems have been done in 8-bit Final Fantasy games and reams of Japanese RPG with lower profiles (the SaGa games come to mind). Also, because the game is so long, you'll probably learn every spell and weapon technique about 50% though the game. Since this removes any real incentive to engage in combat, all future battles are suffocating in how boring they are.The combat is boring. This is mainly because it is incredibly easy. I didn't spend extra time advancing my characters (I tried to finish the game ASAP, actually), so I definitely wasn't too strong. Still, not a single boss offered any form of challenge. Even the final boss felt like nothing more than a ponderous standard encounter. It seems evident to me that a game cannot be exciting when there is no threat...no sense of danger or challenge. This wouldn't be _that_ bad if the battles didn't take so long. So, you get thousands of long, boring, simple fights over the course of the game. The dungeons are amateur in design, and made about 10 times more dreadful because of the combat. There's also a gauge in combat that shows when when each character will take an action. However, this does not create any real strategy because all the characters move at different speeds, so it's just a funky gimmick.The story is not bad, but it is badly told. It uses about every hackneyed Japanese RPG element imaginable, but it doesn't remedy this problem with interesting characters or compelling twists. The translation is just dumb. Sony broke it down to simple diction and pure, fatuous juvenalia. The &quot;romantic&quot; relationship between Justin and Feena is basically insulting -- it has the maturity of an elementary school infatuation. Sue is an utterly pointless character, who's involvement in the story is simple arbitrary and ridiculous. What is the creature &quot;Puffy&quot;? The game never explains. I expected some kind of enigmatic quality to the creature, with a revelation disclosing all at some point (like Nall in Lunar). This never happens. It's stupid. The voice acting is hideous. Attemps at humor fall flat. Attempts at emotional expression are cringe-inducing.The game took me about 50 hours to beat (though I tend to be slower than some). In my mind, the game is about 35 hours too long. So, expect the &quot;meat&quot; of the story to be padded with superfluous side-quests packed with obnoxious combat and torturous dialogue. I like side-quests...when they are optional or purposeful. In this game, the side-quests are neither. Adventures in a ghost ship or on a mysterious prehistoric valley might sound fun on paper, but without important story revelations or fun gameplay, it's boring. Granted about 10 hours of the game is pretty interesting. But that's a mere 20% of the game. In school, that would be an 'F'...a FAILING grade.The game is just tedious. It's boring and insipid and hackneyed to death. I'm sure there will be many who say, &quot;Grandia rulez! you lie!&quot; and give me a &quot;not helpful&quot; vote. I didn't write this to please anybody...I wrote it because I think Grandia does not deserve the praise it receives. Heed my word, and perhaps you will save 50 hours of you life. That's a long time! 50 Law &amp; Order episodes! A genuinely good RPG! Think about it.
Strange how some people regard Grandia as the best Saturn RPG and one of the best on the PlayStation. While Grandia possesses some interesting qualities, it is completely dismantled by a series of devastating flaws that cripple the game. This review will be formulaic, but it will get the point across.The graphical engine was very good. 2D characters and 3D environments that can be rotated at will. I like nuances, and Grandia possesses many. I like knocking over teapots and making clotheslines as I walk into them. The spell effects were boring, however, and the FMV, while technically good at the time, just wasn't exciting.The music is overwrought and almost silly. The main themes seem bombastic and pretentious, as if the game is saying, &quot;Come look at me, I'm important!&quot; The compositions are impressive musically, but they feel emotionally hollow. There is one song, a piano &amp; violin duet, which I loved. It was completely gorgeous. I also liked how the combat music changed as the game continued.

This game was a sinch to beat,its boring and it doesn't deserve to be rated.  Thats all I have to say.

The combat system of this game is painfully slow. Populating excel spreadsheets for IRS tax audits is more exciting. Not at all worth $[...].
I never could get in to this game.  I think the "top down" view just didn't seem right to me.  Plus the graphics aren't all that great.  This game basically fell into the large pit of boring PSP games that everyone complains about.  I can't think of any redeeming qualities that this games possesses.  It's just boring.
Was very much looking forward to this game,unfortunately it falls flat. Cute yes,but dull gameplay.DULL!!!!monotonous, repetitive, uneventful,insipid, uninteresting, unexciting,uninspiring, unstimulating, jejune,flat, stale, tired, banal, lackluster,stodgy, vapid, mind-numbingand wearisome...Odd how such an imaginative lookinggame can have such unimaginative play.
Although this video game is designed for everyone. Our sons almost laughed us out the door. They made it perfectly clear that this game is more targeted for elementary school aged children and not teen agers. They found this game to be boring and too much money for the features included.It did not make the &#34;Big Hit&#34; list, but it did make the returned item list. SorryHowever, don't let our rating be your determining factor, read others and even try it. You may like it, but our sons &#34;hated it&#34;.

Only a baffoon would not see this coming.  If it can't even handle Deus Ex 1 and Rainbow Six 3, what makes you think it's going to be able to run a halo clone.  Call up any psychic, they'll tell you the same thing I'm telling you.  Sattle up the syrup boys, we are headed to the flopzone.

I was a big fan of Parappa the Rapper and I was seriously disappointed with this sequel. It's bad enough that you can beat it in 30 minutes, but what's worse is that you wouldn't want to! The music is just bad and that is inexcusable for a music game. Where are all the catchy tunes? I can't remember one line from this game, whereas I have all of Parappa the Rapper's songs memorized. It's missing those great lyrics found in Parappa like my favorite: &quot;Sunny in my life, she's like a dice, I can't tell which way to turn 'till I spice!&quot; Skip UmJammer and get Parappa.

This could be considered the companion to Alien Trilogy as it takes place in the Fourth Movie following the first three presented in Alien Trilogy.  This game featured controls that people are more familiar with in these days, but didn't understand at the time.  The controls may be above average, and the graphics are excellent for the time, but seriously, the level design is a piece of crap!  What kind of space ship is this?  Very illogical design leads to BORING gameplay that is only fun for 5 minutes with invincibility turned on, otherwise you'll die in 2 minutes without it because you move soo slow.  An interesting thing is that if you get impregnated by a facehugger you won't be allowed to go through airlocks or elevators, which is interesting that they followed through on this principal with the chestbursters, and you'll have to find a device to take out the creature before the time runs out.  The thing that doesn't make sense with this is that even with a chestburster inside you, aliens will attack you, and that makes no sense.  Facehuggers can also attack you by hitting you with their tails.  Don't play this game, I'd rather watch the movie.

The game has nothing to offer. The races are boring and you get nothing out of the game play. Trash trash trash trash TRASH!!
Look, I loved the first PaRappa game so much that I imported the soundtrack.  Heck, I even love UmJammer Lammy despite it's vomiting catipiller's forcing women to give birth, but this game just doesn't measure up.  The main problem is the lack of a fun story-line.  The entire business about all food being turned into noodles is even dumber than it sounds, and the events  leading up to the actual levels are just plain unfunny.  The fact that the songs aren't catchy is also a big let-down, and then add in the fact that you have to play an annoying practice level before each song, and well......it just gets worse from there.  The two player version isn't much to write home about, and the load times hasn't improved much at all.  All in all, this game has had the fun beaten out of it with a large bat, and that makes me all too sad.  You can find the first two games waaaaay cheap, so if you haven't played a PaRappa game, then pick them up and avoid this unless you're a die-hard fan.  In that case, just rent it.

This would be a great game, had Konami already not released five (six when the American Idol one comes out) better Karaoke games for the PS2. You would think that when releasing this game in 2006, Sony would look at its competition and make it equal or better. They did not. I apologize that so much of the review is comparing it to the Karaoke Revolution series, but it's a natural comparison, and unfortunate for Singstar Rocks, as SR is by far an inferior product.I have a lot of the same complaints as others. There are no unlockables. Even though KR's strange costumes are seldom used in our household, it's nice to see things being unlocked as you sing more and better. Singstar Rocks does not do this.The big thing is with the PS2 having two standard USB ports, why they would utilize the mini to USB adapter. This renders the mics useless to the KR games. If they're worried about being able to use an EyeToy simultaneously to two mics, maybe they should have included a USB mini hub instead. It infuriates me that with all the decent USB mics on the market that Sony again would go proprietary (of sorts).Another complaint is the lack of adjustments. In song, KR (dating back to the original) allows you to adjust the vocals, mic and music. Singstar Rocks has only a master volume that doesn't see to do much.It's also unfortunate that Sony stuck with only Sony artists, as they are missing out on a ton of others. The song selection is very random due to this and a couple are very strange selections to have on a sing along disc. There are multiple songs on here that do not make a lot of sense. Of all the Rolling Stones catalog, why would Forty Licks' "Paint it Black" be the one to appear. Lame!In a vacuum, the game is fun, but its song selection, lack of options and its proprietary options all make it fall extremely short to any of the other Karaoke Revolution. Don't waste your time with this one. Get *any* of the KR series over this one.

From the first BOF down to this one, the quality has gradually declined. Sure, it looks prettier than it used to, but with few weapons, fewer spells and less variety with each passing episode, the series is looking more than a little thread-bare.The combat system is good, though it hasn't changed hardly at all since the last time. The spells and skills are copied more or less directly from number III, including such goodies as Flare, Jump and other low-cost, useful abilities. The multi-elemental spell thing was cool but made less useful by the inclusion of a variety of useless or near-useless combinations. Some of the high-power spells require the combination of elements boss-level monsters are immune to and do an overwhelming amount of damage to regular monsters; they simply aren't necessary.The monsters are just slighter higher resolutions of old beasties from the last three games and the dragon spells, while nice to look at, just aren't all that useful or interesting. I used them once and then stopped using them alltogether.The fairies are about the only thing that's improved over the last installation, with multiple uses for fairies and the opportunity to build a significant and powerful attack force with the fairy spells.The movie clips were a nice touch, but they aren't as good as some other RPG movie clips. Check out the new Chrono Trigger/FFIII disc and you'll see what I mean.On the whole, it just wasn't all that great. Still, I've now defeated all four games several times over. When BOF V comes out, I'll check it out before buying it, though.

Grand Turismo is the best racing game on earth. The cars are exactly like the real thing. The reflections onto the car are very realistic as if you were driving it for real. The creators of the game made the speed, handling, acceleration and braking exactly as it would be in real life. they have millions of cars in the game like my pesonal favorite the viper GTS. like the first one the drivers test part is complicated. This time there is a line for the drivers test part that tells you what to do with the diferent coloring of the line. They have these new tracks for of road races. The tracks are somewhat complicated yet fun. So if you're a racing game freak then you'll love this game.

I cannot believe how high a rating this game is getting. This supposed "Zelda killer" is nothing more than a dungeon crawl along the lines of Evolution on Dreamcast. Zelda tramples this bore into the dirt. It's got many similarities to Evolution: randomized dungeon levels, repeat visits back to town to restock on supplies so you can go back to the dungeon, bland enemies, that feeling of inane repetition. As for combat, where's the strategy? Where're the backflips, the dodges, the ability to take out an enemy in more than two fashions, the feeling that you're actually in the middle of a fight instead pressing one button a lot? Basically, you either combo them to death, or you use your charge up super move. Dungeons are bland. Basically, it's a bunch of rooms connected by tunnels. There are no puzzles or unique obstacles that have to be dealt with. There's no sense of discovery, no "Aha!" moments that are the great moments of Zelda style games. Every dungeon just feels like a dungeon. You're not discovering whole new worlds filled with nooks, crannies, and secrets waiting to be found, you're dungeon crawling, looking for loot and the key to the next level so you can do it all over again. Gameplay is repetitive. Venture to the dungeon, find the mystic balls and key, go back to town, build (which does have a minor appeal to it) and get supplies (did I mention your character has to have a drink of water every three minutes? Or that his weapon starts to wear down and break after killing five or six enemies?), venture to the dungeon and find mystic balls on the next level which looks exactly the same as the first. Ugh, ugh, ugh!

I've played dozens of games in the this genre, and while this might have been great in its day, every mechanic in Dark Cloud is done better by another title I've enjoyed more.  Compared against other mystery dungeon runners on PS2, The Nightmare of Druaga is much better, and Baroque just blows this game out of the water on style points. If you are an adult gamer who likes sci-fi, and wants a unique mystery dungeon experience, buy Baroque PS2 instead."Repetitive" is the game's theme. Graphics aren't varied -- only tunnels and the same rooms, with no secret tunnels/areas that make the genre surprising and enjoyable.  (Azure Dreams on ps1 does this so much better...)  The "lock on" makes the camera go crazy, and crazy cameras give me a headache. So because this function was useless, I was forced into clumsily seeking after enemies, who often got easy hits on me, and that experience quickly bored and annoyed me because I fighting the controls, not the monsters. I only played for a few hours before I decided there were randomized mystery dungeon games I enjoy more with similar themes. (This is no Zelda... heck, it's not even as fun as Dark Legion: Vampire Apocalypse or Chocobo's Dungeon.)Don't buy this one.

Dark Cloud is a Zelda/Actraiser hybrid that seems to try too hard to be perfect on the town buidling part and neglects some things in the dungeon battles. For one, having to throw powder on your weapon to keep it from breaking is stupid. What idiot thought that idea up? Plus the weapon building system is long and complex and not really explained well enough. They should just have better weapons lying in treasure chests as you go along.

People say this game is like left 4 dead 2 with police which is why I bought it. I guess I see similarities but I want to correct this statement by saying that it IS like left 4 dead 2 with police except its not fun.
Pros: 1. Copied many concepts from MVP 2005 such as hot/cold zones, pitching meter, anologue stick power.2. ESPN like replay quality with the two teams playing each other shown.3. Good broadcasting.Cons: 1. A clone copy of the two other games from LAST YEAR.2. Poor Graphics.3. Limited announcing phrases.4. Wasn't having nearly as much fun as with usual video games.Overall: This game had more negatives than positives. I liked last years version better.

This 3D tv glasses use a shutter which is not that great!  Dolby 3D is the best 3D out there.  Vivzo is coming out with a 3D TV that uses glasses with no shutter.  The price is going to be low.  $495.00 for this TV is not worth it!
First of all, why the HELL is this thing $15 dollars PLUS tax. I have PlayStation2, and I don't generally like it. I thought Microsoft was trying to steal your money, but now this PIECE OF GARBAGE comes along and it is a JOKE. Why is Amazon selling this for $15 dollars. i got mine with my PlayStation2 and now they are selling it just to keep space. This is a total joke...........Now that I have cooled down, this can be space saving. If it was free, well, it would be a good buy. PlayStation2 is not THAT big, and if you don't have enough space 1)Your poor and can only put everything in one room or 2)You have those TV's which have a million plugs. That is why it gets at least two stars, because nothing is THAT bad, (well...some games and equipment have gone over the edge).So, instead of wasting $15 dollars, go out and save up for some games. The blue color is not impressive, and it doesn't cool down and it doesn't scratch your discs. Actually, it only does one thing, wastes your money.

The combat system of this game is painfully slow. Populating excel spreadsheets for IRS tax audits is more exciting. Not at all worth $[...].
You shouldn't have to be patient and wait for a game to get better. The playstation2 to this point is the most awful RPG system I have ever played. I miss the playstation already. This game is acceptable has a "cute" story but not an epic by any means, good rpg for newbies and kids.

I will list the reasons why this game doesn't add up.  First and foremost, controlling the character (Hammond) is almost impossible.  He runs slower than my grandmother, and as he loses health, he runs even slower.  He cannot run up or down stairs-- he tends to prance up them-- not kidding.  The characters use the F word in every cutscene, which is just stupid.  When your player gets in a car, he cannot drive more than 40 mph for some reason, regardless of the type of automobile.  You cannot shoot weapons out of cars while you drive, yet other gang members can shoot at you from their cars.  In out-of-vehicle gun battles (on foot) auto aim is sluggish and often unreliable.  When you get shot, you have to limp to a wall and lean there for 60 seconds to regain health, which gets annoying when gang members are shooting at you.  controls are HORRIBLE, and the weapons selection is very limited (shotguns, MP-5's and AK-47s are the most powerful weapons.ON THE POSITIVE SIDE:  The Getaway has incredible graphics and takes place in a virtual London (downtown area) that is almost a replica of the British city.  Real brand names exist-- you can see popular fast-food places and clothing stores, which adds a lot of realism.  All the major London landmarks are in the game, Buckingham Palace, Trefalgar Square, Big Ben/Parliament, Tower of London/museum, London Eye, etc.. The traffic AI is very impressive, and there are many more cars on the streets than in the popular GTA3 games.Summary: Graphics and cityscape are very realistic, but the sluggish play control makes the game very annoying.

The graphics are stupendous. The images are great. The detail is fantastic. But it isn't any fun to play.The reason for this is GT3's overburdensome menu system. You spend so much time tweaking your cars and going through the tremendous amount of menus and sub menus in order to qualify or enter a race, that the whole process kills the fun of the game. GT3 is basically GT2 with superior graphics. The courses are the same...just better looking.Qualifiying for licenses is also a big chore. While it was fun during the first two GT's, this third one is just another step that removes you from the action of racing. The experience is frustrating.I had high hopes for GT3, but it fell way short of being entertaining. If a racing game prevents you from racing, then what is the point? The game is beautiful graphically. There is no doubt about this. However, the game is pure frustration because you do more menu navigating then actual racing. If racing is your interest, check out WipeOut Fusion as an alternative.

I bought this game because the sales charts revealed it was a top-seller... But now that I've played it, I can only assume that everyone else was as duped as I was. This game is terrible. The graphics, I will admit, are amazing, but the game play is just down-right uninnovated. You can't take shortcuts (even tho the box says &quot;careen off the dirt path&quot;) and the machinery isn't different enough.They did spend a lot of money on the music and instruction booklet, as the first includes tracks from Alice in Chains and Soundgarden and the later which is a full-color 49 page manual. But if you want a good off-road racing game, buy Rumble Racing.

In order to be impressed by the graphics, you need a HDTV.  Without one it's a touched up GT3, jaggies and all.  The city tracks are nice to look at, but the actual race courses(laguna seca) are poorly done, especially considering there are only 6 cars per race.  I didn't want to use the F word(I'm not even getting it), but the side-by-side video between GT4 and Forza's Laguna Seca is an eye-opener.  The PS2 is capable of more than this.To notice the physics differences, your going to have to have the $150 wheel.  This is the only real addition worth buying the game for, but most people are going to skip it due to it being as much as a new console.  The bottom line is the game in this day in age feels dated and wooden without the wheel.  Now this doesn't apply if you didn't play the other GT's, but what the hell kind of racing fan hasn't.The interface is pretty much the same as always.  Sure some things like races are better organized, but they are just sprawled all over the place on the map.  And you know that little Garage icon from earlier GT's.  Say goodbye to that.For all the delay hoopla, nothing meaningful was done except PD playing around with obscure japanese cars.  No online play, AI or damage will mark the GT series' downfall.  Enthusia, nevermind inevitably forza, might take the crown away this year.  Unless you meet the far-fetched criteria needed to see changes, you are better off passing on this game.

Just as a disclaimer, my standards are very low when it comes to racing games. So when I say this game sucks, I mean most normal gamers will think this game sucks.I loved GT3 so I thought this would be an improvement. But I was wrong. This game sucks in every possible way, interface sucks, the graphics are worse than GT3, and the events are the same as GT3. The license tests are embarrassing to the franchise.I was hesitant to buy the game in the first place but after I saw the positive reviews on amazon (124 5stars and 36 1stars) I thought that many people can't be wrong, but I was SOOO WRONG. Those people were either paid off to make good reviews or the sellers of the game made fake reviews to con us into buying it. Either way they were wrong.PLEASE DO NOT waste your money on this game.

What a generic title. Given the game, that's par for the course. The Legend of Dragoon is certainly the most generic game I've played on the Playstation. It's sort of sad, in many ways, that it was released by SCEA only months before Chrono Cross and Final Fantasy IX, and over a year after Final Fantasy VIII.What's generic about it? Damn near everything. The main character is a spiky-haired blonde dude whose small village is destroyed by an evil empire, and who is designated the "chosen one" by a pendant, previously possessed by a mysterious stranger. Can you even name how many other games that borrows from? Do numbers go that high? And I forgot to mention, his representative color is red. Of course, the empire is still on the prowl, and Dart has to chase them with a diverse group of heroes.And that's not even touching the translation- The Legend of Dragoon boasts some truly embarrassing translation errors. Square learned this lesson after Final Fantasy VII, which took a lot of flack for its stereotypes and writing, but that game had an interesting setting and strong enough characters to make up for it. The Legend of Dragoon wasn't just several years behind, it was at least two games behind by PS1 jRPG standards.While the story is generic and perfunctory, it's not really the problem. Let's talk about the combat. The Legend of Dragoon's basis for combat is a series of timed button presses known as "additions." When one chooses the attack option, a reticle focuses in on the enemy, and a button must be pressed to time with the animation. While this basic idea has been done in other games, like Vagrant Story, Final Fantasy VIII, and the Mario and Luigi series, The Legend of Dragoon makes it the core of combat, and that's a fatal error. While timed button presses were integral to the games I mentioned, the important thing is that they didn't slow down the combat. The Legend of Dragoon's combat forces you to do this chain of animations every time you click attack, and when you miss, you get to see your character freeze in place as a number appears only once in front of the enemy. Random encounters, which are the majority of the game in RPGs, take forever and feel clunky. The Dragoon transformations- a flashy sequence comparable to Power Rangers- are also longer than necessary and the Dragoon attacks do little to change my complaints about the rest of the game.The look of the game is very generic as well. While the pre-rendered backgrounds of the game look fine, the character models outside of combat are simplistic and poorly animated. The in-combat look is marginally better, and while the Dragoon transformations look good, the default character models aren't very detailed, and neither are the enemies. The combat environments look especially poor- many of the floors and walls are a single polygon with a blocky texture applied to it.As far as I'm concerned, the great-looking cinematics don't count when we're talking about graphics, though it is worth noting that the ones in The Legend of Dragoon look great. But you might as well jump on youtube and watch all of them instead of playing the game, or rent Advent Children or The Spirits Within, or Shrek for that matter, if that's all you care about. The art design of the game doesn't lend itself to Playstation's technology.I hesitate to speculate on matters like this, but The Legend of Dragoon strikes me as an attempt by Sony to cash in after the success of Final Fantasy VII. The game looks an awful lot like that game, with a fantasy setting substituted for a steam/cyberpunk one. I wouldn't call that an improvement.

Legend of Dragoon is one of those games that you either love or despise, I of course belong to the later group.As one reviewer already mentioned, Legend of Dragoon was Sony's answer to rival Square-Enix's insanely popular Final Fantasy VII. I have to laugh when it took them three years to cook up this title that can't even dent the Final Fantasy fanchise.I don't think the Final Fantasy series is the greatest thing since sliced bread (I actually like the Wild Arms series the most), but the only thing Legend of Dragoon really had going for it was its graphics, which I will admit where pretty sweet at the time.Outside the graphical engine, Legend of Dragoon is second rate RPG in every category. Lame enemies, lackluster story, generic locations, and some of the worst music to ever accompany an PSX RPG ever (it's really that bad). Fights are also annoying due to the so-called "Additions" system which has you doing timed hits all day (yeah, that's what I call fun when I have to hit a button 8 times in a row at just the correct moment just to attack).Other problems also arise, such as the fact no one can use magic outside of their dragoon transformations, meaning their is really no way to heal your characters except for items (which you become way too dependent on in this game, and can only carry so many). Outside the dragoon tranformations the battle system is very weak.Play Legend of Dragoon only after you have destroyed every other PSX PRG. By that time you'll realize that this is not what any and all PSX RPG's should be compared against. Even if Final Fantasy is extremely overrated at times, even the worst FF is better than this. I don't think I'll play this one again.

who is giving this good reviews? This has to be the worst RPG on PS1. Interestingly, Sony initially believed that JRPGs wouldnt sell well in the west, and they released japanese games only if they were action/ arcade games. This was the first JRPG released, and it was something of a surprise "hit". Its strong sales showed that there was a ready western market for JRPGs and led to the later high profile releases of classic rpgs such as final fantasy 7 and breath of fire 4.Like many PS1 owners at that time, I eagerly anticipated this game, hoping for an epic experience similar to final fantasy 6 on the SNES, but with incredible PSX graphics lol. Instead I got this horrible rubbish. Its completely generic with no personality whatsoever and includes every RPG cliche there is. Its extremely easy, with extremely simple mechanics, and also very long and tedious with endless dull battles.

The game play is kind of complicated, also, you get an interminable chain of fights that makes the game quite monotonic.
It could be he's too young for racing games and I can see how someone older would enjoy it .. but my 9 year old simply wasn't into it... and he's a big fan of Super Mario Galaxy on the Wii, played that until beating it then beat it a second time playing as Luigi instead of Mario.. so it's not that he can't handle complicated games he simply wasn't into it.. could be he doesn't like racing games?
The storyline seemed borrowed, the first game that came to mind was legend of legaia. A big problem for me was the battle system ussualy i can stay up late and play videogames, but with this the attacks were insanely hard to do. I ended up missing more than i was hitting. The best part was the videos were crazy cool and probaly why it was so many cd's. It's a long game and if you like it you will love it and if you hate it you won't be able to get through one cd.

This game is great if you have 12 or so hrs to spend getting your Drivers lic. There are a total of 42 test you must pass to get all 6 drivers lic. Infact, I wouldn't be suprised if it takes someone 24 hrs to pass them all. Shouldn't these test be optional? They could award cash or the best cars after finishing each lic test. But they make you go through this [garbage] of taking these useless test. I'm on the last test of my B lic. I spend nearly 5 hrs total. I doubt I will pass it. Sorry, but that is not fun!! I love a challenge but the developers made the test way to difficult..

Despite the highly impressive introductory scene and menu screen, don't be deceived.  This game is far too conventional and undeniably sloppy.  Terrible low quality graphics and messy animation, lifeless paper diorama-like environments, corny cliched looped background 'noise' which fails to evoke a dark, haunting atmosphere.  The controls can become extremely confusing and frustrating in times of crisis (plenty of mutilation, blood spillage and cleavage wobbling though).  The characters are in many ways stereotyped and dull yet cheaply sexy and appealing (in the busty exotic bombshell type way - a cross between Elvira and Mortal Kombat's Sonya Blade).The concept and storyline (or lack of) is shallow and focuses more on show-casing stereotypical gothic style, lacking substance and depth.It's a shame, this game potentially could've been much better.  It certainly doesn't do justice for the X-box either...  It's still an appealing short-lasting novelty like playing old platformers for nostalgic value.  It's fun and wasteful but certainly not for those who want a worthwhile challenge.

First off, this game features the most downright ugly hero you'll ever see.The controls are sluggish and annoying. 'Ammond runs like a Thunderbirds puppet and it becomes a feat in itself to simply move about.Can't run and shoot. Very innovative. When you stand still, the baddies shoot you. Go figure.In this realistic game, our gormless hero can't open doors, jump over foot-high blockades (or jump at all) and recovers from shotgun blasts to the face by leaning against walls.The game isn't 'fun' in the same way GTA is- the car chase bits are deathly dull, due to the fact that you'll crash into a car or pole every ten seconds. The cops can't pull you out of your car either, so it's more of an endurance test than a challenge, just keep ploughing along.The regular cars barely move at all, only the Lexuses and sportscars are worth jacking.No camera angles in the car sections, so mission briefs like "Bring the triads to our HQ, and make sure that they follow you" are nonsensical as you cant look behind you. No onscreen maps or info either. Or ammo counts for that matter.Everything is so big on the screen- compare the feeling of space that you have around you in GTA with this. In GTA, traffic and baddies can be seen approaching, whereas in this they appear right on you.Again, the 'lean-against-a-wall-to-gain-energy' system. Even the non playable characters comment that you're standing around like an idiot. Sorry love, can't help it.Glitchy graphics. A friend of mine encountered a horde of giants in Hyde Park who shrunk to midgets once neared. Is perspective reversal common in the UK?Negotiating stairwells cause 'Ammond to perform a very camp jig. Can't the man just bound up them with dignity?And so on and so on...

I'm going to forego my usual in-depth reviews for this game. We all know what Twisted Metal is and this is nothing more than a rehash of those same games. Here's why:Pros:Excellent GraphicsCool Mini-moviesEndurance & Challenge levels are interestingGood to pass time withCons:Short game with small levelsRepetitious gameplayBoring endings to each characterSame old rehash of earlier TM gamesNot enough "total-destruction" of buildings and such for this type of game.If you want to be "burned-out" by a game, I recommend "Burnout, Test Drive, and Twisted Metal: Black." Not worth the money. A renatal at best.

I expected this game to really rule. I thought to myself, &quot;Tens of thousands of players rpging together? It will be chaos! People will be banding into nations and battling each other for dominion! Imagine my disappointment when I found that pking is not only disallowed(or restricted), in most servers, most players I talked to professed DISGUST at player killers! Worse, guards are now near invulnerable. What? Can't a guy have a little fun and slip a 6-inch dagger between a guard's plates and into his back? It's only an AI. I pray for the day that someone with a sense of fun (dreary drugdgery, which is what this game is starting to feel like after four months) takes over this company and point this world into the right direction.

ANY songs you download with this game will be tied to the machine you downloaded them to. They cannot be redownloaded or repurchased on any other machine with the master account you used to purchased them. This is a SERIOUS problem for anyone who makes a significant investment into additional songs, especially if you ever have to replace your PS3.There are multiple postings in the PSN newsgroups about this problem--wish I knew about it before making my purchase.The game is tons of fun, but consider investing elsewhere if there is an alternative.

I got this game after purchasing a PS3, thinking that even if this game wasn't all that great, I could use the two microphones (which came with a USB adaptor) for Karaoke Revolution games.  I was wrong.  Because the microphones are not actual USB mics and have to plug into a USB adaptor, Karaoke Revolution games do not detect these "SingStar" mics.Secondly, SingStar does not give you the option to remove the lead vocals from the songs.  This defeats the whole purpose of Karaoke.  Even on Karaoke mode, the lead vocals are still there.Lastly, The game has a very small selection of songs, and there are a handful of tracks that are "medleys", which are basically a medley from choruses of the same songs that are already on this game.Conclusion.  This is NOT a Karaoke game, as it does not give you the option to strip the lead vocals, and the microphones included with the game are not compatible with any other games for the PS2 or PS3.  If I was given the option, I would give this game ZERO stars.

I could understand Guitar Hero and Rock Band not having any non Rock & Roll songs.  But SingStar has no excuse with this kind of song selection since it is being marketed as a Karaoke Game.No Motown, no classics, just bunch of songs that the guitar hero and rock band demographics might be familiar with.
If you like advertisements at every turn, on every vehicle, in allmost every song played and know how to for real really race a car down a buteiful looping course with cutt out cardboard fans. Then for all means purchase this game, I'll use it for charcol to barbaque some nicely portion pieces of slaughtered cow.

I love the game when I get to the snowboarding parts, but its way too much work getting to ride. The graphics are really sweet. I love the way snow gets kicked up into the camera when you land, but I dont know if I can get over the glaringly annoying features of this game:1) I feel like I am playing one of those Barbie dress-up games when I get to buy coats, pants, and goggles, give me a break. New equipment such as boards and bindings make sense, but jackets?!?!2) Too much menu wrangling to get to the actual game play. If I lose a competition, there is no retry button. You have to go back to the lodge and walk over to the cheesy box head guy and enter all over again. Then at the end of the run you have to choose between replay and proceed, with the default always being proceed. Its just a major hassle. They should learn from Tony Hawk. They have it down.3) Too much loading, especially in multiplayer session stuff. Nobody likes spending more time loading than playing.4) Not enough thought put into the session competitions. For instance, there is one race with rails and windy, narrow lanes that have huge drop-offs on either side, if you fall off either side, you lose. It ends rather abrubtly this way, right before either player can get into it. Why not just send the rider back to the beginning of the course?

In my time I've used many microphones but I've never seen one that died as quickly as this set. The sound quality on the pink/red one never was very good - you had to sing very loudly into it for it to pick up your voice. It died quicker than the blue but the blue one started to go soon after. We had these microphones for about 3 months of light use and careful storage before we had to replace them.The only good thing I can say about this set is that the adapter works great for other microphones. We bought Audio-Technica Unidirectional mics to replace these and they work wonderfully with the Singstar adapter on our PS2 and the Wii. No need to buy a new adapter or microphones. It's the adapter that kept me from rating this product as 1 star.If you're looking for microphones for a singing game, I'd only recommend these for the adapter. For the actual mics go with something else.

&quot;EverQuest: Planes Of Power&quot; was obviously designed to cater to &quot;Uber-Guilds,&quot; an expression used in the EverQuest online community to denote player guilds which are rather advanced in skills and prior experience, and large in numbers. The single adventurer, as well as the casual gamer or relative newcomer, will find little to no content whatsoever which is available to them in this expansion pack (past a certain point). It is all about groups and large scale raids. Solo gameplay in the &quot;Planes of Power&quot; zones is next to impossible, and that is appparently by design. In fact, several player class abilities were &quot;nerfed&quot; by Sony just prior to the release of this expansion, ostensibly to &quot;better balance the classes.&quot; It is far more likely that those &quot;nerfs&quot; were enacted to prevent any possibility of traditional solo classes (such as Wizards and Druids) from being able to do any effective soloing in the new zones.Another problematic feature of this add-on is the overpowered &quot;gear&quot; that one can obtain from the high-end encounters featured in &quot;PoP.&quot; Introducing too much &quot;uber gear&quot; to an MMORPG game is precisely what ultimately ruined &quot;Diablo 2&quot; when the &quot;Lord of Destruction&quot; expansion was released. For many gamers, the focus becomes shifted away from roleplaying and game content, and instead toward greed for items which they can strut and show off to other players. It also tends to make player characters who *can* manage to obtain those items a bit too powerful, which hardly seems to fit in with Sony's highly questionable assertions... that several prior ability nerfs were done to &quot;better balance the classes.&quot; If anything is true about &quot;Planes of Power,&quot; it's that it is decidely UN-balanced in the extreme.Painfully short on game content, all too few and sloppily written quests, overly lengthy encounters and a generally poor payoff in the &quot;Plane of Time&quot; endzone are what one can expect from this mediocre expansion pack. Whilst it is a &quot;must have&quot; for all EverQuest players, it hardly stacks up well against prior expansions such as &quot;Scars Of Velious&quot; or &quot;Shadows Of Luclin&quot; so far as actual depth, atmosphere and overall content is concerned. This is also the first EverQuest expansion set which the original game designers (Verant International) had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with, and it shows. Moreover, &quot;Planes Of Power&quot; is an expansion pack which 99% of all players will never see the bulk of, due to their being unable to assemble the &quot;muscle&quot; required to fully explore the additional zones and adversaries. Not being able to see three quarters of a game you pay for is rather disappointing (to say the least), so unless you already belong to a highly-skilled player guild, do not expect to progress past a very superficial point in this add-on to EverQuest.Lastly, &quot;The Planes Of Power&quot; tends to look and play more like a Sony PlayStation 2 game than an add-on for a classic PC based MMORPG. Storyline depth and roleplaying content has been replaced in favour of eye candy, overpowered enemies, and ridiculously and unnecessarily overpowered items designed to appeal to player egos. &quot;PoP&quot; is not entirely without merit, but depending on what you look for in a roleplaying game, you may be disappointed overall. Defenders of this add-on have often said to me  &quot;Well, Sony knows what sells, that's why PoP is the way it is, and that's the bottom line.&quot; Naturally, I have no problem with manufacturers of PC games making a profit on their merchandise, but I see no reason why profits and product integrity need be mutually exclusive concepts.Thumbs down overall, but a necessary add-on for all EverQuest players.

The general consensus amongst the MMORPG community would seem to be this: EverQuest II is yet another example of Sony's fanatical obsession with eye candy over content.There's little to no "meat" here... in fact, Sony's own online websites can't seem to provide any sort of storyline behind EverQuest II, other than it being set 400 years or so from the time of the original EverQuest, the moon of Luclin blew up, and now the entire huge, sprawling world of Norrath has been reduced to two measly starting cities, on one continent......sounds pretty cheesy to me. Wanna see another red flag..? The sheer size of the installation of this game positively SCREAMS that it's loaded with resource-sucking bells and whistles, which Sony is well-known for focusing on when their overall storyline and content are weak.Most veteran EverQuest players have watched Sony Online Entertainment completely RUIN the original EverQuest, ever since late 2002 when Sony bought out Verant (the originators of that once-classic MMORPG game). Given what we've all seen from SOE over the past few years (the destruction of EverQuest, the absurdly pointless Star Wars Galaxies, horrible customer service, and insultingly shameless greed), I see absoultely no reason whatsoever to believe that EverQuest II will be anything short of an overpriced, inane memory hog of a "game" that will ultimately leave the player feeling unsatisfied and cheated....

Champions of Norrath: Realms of Everquest grafts the top-down (seen from above) hack 'n' slash action engine ofBaldur's Gate: Dark Allianceonto the names and places that define the world ofEverquest I: The Anniversary Edition.  As evidenced by my reviews ofAlien SyndromeandPhantasy Star Portable, I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to this kind of game.  It has to be pretty awful for me to actually not play it, especially if I have someone to play it with.  My girlfriend decided she'd dive into some game or another with me on the PS2, so we'd be playing together on one screen, sitting together on the couch, nice fire going in the fireplace, and so on.  I happily dug out this dungeon crawler that I'd gotten some time ago, but never played.If you want only to know if Champions manages to deliver on the very most basic elements of this kind of game, then you can stop right here, because this will take awhile.  The answer is "yes," it generally lets you do what a dungeon crawler should.  You have a few different classes, you have a few different locales, you can kill things and take their stuff, and you can keep on doing that for hours, as the game offers three successive difficulty levels, each making the same story progressively tougher for higher level ranges.  It supports up to four players locally with multitap, and has a client/server network mode that is probably based on a server that is no longer running.A few basic archetypes common to this sort of game define the classes; healer, tank, ranged DPS (damage-per-second), and magic DPS, as well as a hybrid melee/magic class.  However, though they hit all the right notes in concept, execution is sloppy, to be polite.  The tank class, while quite hardy, has no real tools for managing aggro (who the enemy non-player characters are attacking), which means that the healer isn't really free to heal, since they're defending themselves instead of relying upon the tank.  The magic DPS class doesn't really do much damage, considering all of the drawbacks it has with such a narrow focus.There's nothing inherently wrong with this sort of gameplay, but it's frustrating to see familiar terms and trappings, sit down to play, and discover that there's really nothing like what was described in the manual, insofar as gameplay, anywhere in the actual game.  It's not really a cooperative multiplayer dungeon crawler so much as it is a simultaneous overlapping single player dungeon crawler.Champions makes use of a pre-patchDiablo 2-style skill tree for each of five classes.  When I say pre-patch, I refer to the fact that when Diablo 2 first released, one of the chief complaints players had against it was that early skills in any given skill tree often felt like they served no purpose other than gating access to higher-level, and presumably better, skills later in the tree.  Towards the end of the game's life, later patches included an update that made earlier skills improve upon later ones in the same line of the tree, such that "maxing" those skills, or raising them as high as the game allowed, wasn't necessarily a waste of points, since it improved the function of a descendant.No such luck in Champions, as we get skills that not only have no impact on later skills in a tree beyond gating access to them, but skills that often seem as though they're only in a certain part of the tree because there wasn't any better place to put them.  With a little digging online, you can find out what each skill does for each class at each level (some classes share a skill, but with different levels of effectiveness by level for each).  However, the game itself has almost nothing to offer in that regard, as it only ever tells you what the current skill level does, and the next level, if it exists.  There is also a surprising lack of skill-boosting gear in the game, at least so far as we've played it.Combined with the all-sales-are-final approach to skill point management, the game progressively feels more and more punishing, as any skill point regret you may suffer can only be assuaged by starting over and being more miserly.  Not only do you have no real good idea how any given skill grows to its maximum level of 20, such as when it hits a point where you would personally consider it to be offering diminishing returns, but if you decide to really commit and dump a bunch of points in, only to discover you wish you hadn't, well.  Too bad.In action, skills are assigned by means of an eight-way radial menu, managed with the D-pad, in concert with either the Triangle or Circle buttons.  This menu can be arranged from the character sheet, and used while playing, without pausing, to assign skills to either button.  When the action ebbs, it's a passable enough system, which manages to pack a whole lot of skills into two teeny, tiny buttons.  But when the blood and gore are a-flyin', its clumsiness is exacerbated.Say you're a Cleric, for example, which often lives or dies by its numerous self-buffs, skills that improve stats in various categories for their duration.  For each of them, you must press and hold the D-pad in the direction of the skill you wish to assign, press the button to which you wish to assign it, then release the button, then release the D-pad, then press the button to actually cast it.  Then you get to repeat this process for each buff, all of which start with impossibly short durations, before finally re-re-assigning the button to a more regularly used active skill, like Holy Strike, a ranged spell attack.  Annoying enough when you're not even in combat, but potentially lethal to your character when you are.  (According to its manual,Champions Return to Arms, the sequel, solves this problem by allowing the player to press the Square button in combination with the D-pad to simply trigger a skill at that location, in addition to the assignment model from this game; a vast improvement, but that's another review.)Like any other dungeon crawler, Champions is very loot-oriented, with the rapid cycle of kill something, take its stuff, equip it, and repeat generally making up the entirety of the game.  A storyline of sorts is sprinkled about here and there, but it's really just an excuse to change the backdrop and offer more things to kill, because those things have stuff you can take.  Whenever you're full, you use a gate scroll or one of the portal stones scattered about the landscape to return to the town for that act, sell what you don't want, keep what you do, resupply on health or mana potions, arrows, throwing spears, etc., and then return to the fray.Unfortunately, the encumbrance system which limits how much you can carry (with the exception of quest items, which are uniformly weightless, regardless of how absurd that often is) is unbalanced and half-baked.  The answer is to raise your Strength stat, which directly increases the amount of weight you can carry, and/or to put points into a passive skill that every class shares, which increases the amount you can carry as well.Naturally, this is a pretty useless skill for the Barbarian, which has a combat-based reason to raise Strength, as Strength impacts melee damage output.  On the other hand, this means it's also not really a problem for the Barbarian.  Unfortunately, our poor friend the Wizard has to decide where he wants to be wasteful; with a skill that has no impact on his already pathetic damage, or with a stat that's equally without value in all other regards.Champions does make use of a slotting system, also very reminiscent of Diablo 2, wherein various items that have no purpose on their own can be irrevocably attached to an equippable item, provided it has enough slots to accept them.  These items can raise base stats like Strength or Intelligence, add elemental damage, provide resistance to such damage, etc.  Each comes in five tiers of effectiveness, but there is no mechanism by which lesser types can be cashed in for greater.  There is also curiously no level bar, or any other bar, to using them, although you cannot stack the same type multiple times in the same item.  That is, if you slot a rune into your sword that raises Strength by 45, you cannot put another one into that sword.  You can, however, put one into every single other piece of equipment you have (provided it does not already have a Strength bonus), effectively raising your Strength by over 300 right at level 1.  (For scale, your starting strength is anywhere between about 25 and 50.)There is also no storage area, so if you find something that is for a Cleric but you're a Barbarian, and you think, "I'd like to make a Cleric and use that item," you will need to survive the obstacle course that is Champions' save and load system.  While your current game is indicated with an asterisk in the save and load menu, the rest of the data is almost uniformly worthless.  It tells you to which difficulty the game is set, it tells you the date and time it was saved, and it tells you the area in which it was saved.  No character names or levels, nothing to tell you who's actually in there.  That wouldn't be so bad if the entire save and load system didn't take so long or occasionally crash the system.If you are careful, though, you can work around the lack of a vault by spawning endless copies of mules, characters who serve no purpose other than to store loot.  And since you can load any character into any game at almost any time, regardless of difficulty, you can also make as many copies of that loot as you want.  While this makes for some insanely overpowered items when slotted with infinite copies of socket items, it simultaneously neuters the cool-sounding "unique" items.  Ordinarily, if you couldn't make infinite copies of everything, finding a named chest plate, for example, that has a couple so-so mods and one free slot would be a boon.  However, given the choice between that item, or one with a similar armor value, and three slots, the decision is obvious.The resistances, which can also be acquired on some jewelry, range from the very obvious (fire) to the completely obscure (magic).  But, much like the skill tree, since it's never really clear exactly what resistance does (whether it be reducing your chance to be hit by the damage type, or reducing the amount of damage you suffer from it), and in some cases, it's not even clear with which damage type you're being attacked (unfortunately, "not fire" isn't a category), the advantage of having some is equally murky.And then there's presentation.  Voice actors don't seem to be sure what sort of accent they're affecting, and sadly, however unsurprisingly, a clear gender bias is present throughout.  Leave a female Shadow Knight idle long enough, and she'll let you know that "if you keep looking at me like that, I'll have to charge extra."  Because she's... already charging you to look at her?  You know, like a woman.  Take her into a lava-filled cavern, and the first thought that pops into her head, predictably, is that "this place is hotter and steamier than I am."  But, aren't you also really handy with a sword?  Sure, but who cares about that?  Hot and steamy!I realize this game is now over six years old as I write this, but even today, this remains a real problem with this industry in general.  I understand target markets and all that, and I don't see anything wrong with visually pleasing characters of either gender being used to draw an audience.  At the same time, however, for the gaming industry to muse upon the mysterious, illusive female gamer while simultaneously and needlessly filling the huge majority of games with any sort of violence with such shameless sexism is hypocritical, not to mention lazy and pathetic.  Its degrading to women at large, and insulting to male gamers as well.For the meat of the gameplay itself, there is some faint glimmer of elegance, as upgrading the speed of your weapon by way of a misty globe series socket item will change the pace with which you may use it.  That does not mean, however, that you can get away with just mashing the button as fast as possible, and capitalize on this.  It means instead that you must find the precise rhythm your weapon's speed requires (at the default speed, and each of the five varying tiers of misty globes), and tap the X button accordingly.  If you manage to do so, you will be rewarded with that increased attack rate, which offers potentially significant boosts to your damage.  It's not much, but frankly, in one of the worst dungeon crawlers I've played in years (and that's saying something), it's a welcome relief.  A game that was made bearable almost entirely because I was playing with my girlfriend, as we at turns shook our heads in disbelief at some aspects, and laughed at others, sometimes because we just didn't know what else to do, was elevated somewhat by the discovery of a crude semblance of challenging gameplay.On the other hand, faced with more than two or three enemies at a time, at least in a two-player simultaneous game, the engine chugs, and there is noticeable slowdown.  This of course impacts that timing in a way that isn't quite sporting.  Mind you, it's still painfully easy to slog through the enemies of this game.  Player deaths are few and far between, and owe in equal measure to tactical error, a random itch now and again, and the occasional sudden appearance of absurdly cute little kittens in various unexpected parts of our home, the latter two of which we have found far more interesting.  The discovery that there was actually some challenge to aspire to meet anywhere in the game at all was a godsend.I could go on for hours about everything that's wrong with this game, and cover what's right in just a few short sentences.  But, as I said, I'm generally pretty easy on this kind of game.  Can I kill stuff?  Check.  Can I take its stuff?  Check.  The graphics are as good as anything else on the PS2, so I should be good to go, right?  Well... given the limited selection of dungeon crawlers on PS2... yeah, I guess.
Champions of Norrath: Realms of Everquest grafts the top-down (seen from above) hack 'n' slash action engine ofBaldur's Gate: Dark Allianceonto the names and places that define the world ofEverquest I: The Anniversary Edition.  As evidenced by my reviews ofAlien SyndromeandPhantasy Star Portable, I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to this kind of game.  It has to be pretty awful for me to actually not play it, especially if I have someone to play it with.  My girlfriend decided she'd dive into some game or another with me on the PS2, so we'd be playing together on one screen, sitting together on the couch, nice fire going in the fireplace, and so on.  I happily dug out this dungeon crawler that I'd gotten some time ago, but never played.If you want only to know if Champions manages to deliver on the very most basic elements of this kind of game, then you can stop right here, because this will take awhile.  The answer is "yes," it generally lets you do what a dungeon crawler should.  You have a few different classes, you have a few different locales, you can kill things and take their stuff, and you can keep on doing that for hours, as the game offers three successive difficulty levels, each making the same story progressively tougher for higher level ranges.  It supports up to four players locally with multitap, and has a client/server network mode that is probably based on a server that is no longer running.A few basic archetypes common to this sort of game define the classes; healer, tank, ranged DPS (damage-per-second), and magic DPS, as well as a hybrid melee/magic class.  However, though they hit all the right notes in concept, execution is sloppy, to be polite.  The tank class, while quite hardy, has no real tools for managing aggro (who the enemy non-player characters are attacking), which means that the healer isn't really free to heal, since they're defending themselves instead of relying upon the tank.  The magic DPS class doesn't really do much damage, considering all of the drawbacks it has with such a narrow focus.There's nothing inherently wrong with this sort of gameplay, but it's frustrating to see familiar terms and trappings, sit down to play, and discover that there's really nothing like what was described in the manual, insofar as gameplay, anywhere in the actual game.  It's not really a cooperative multiplayer dungeon crawler so much as it is a simultaneous overlapping single player dungeon crawler.Champions makes use of a pre-patchDiablo 2-style skill tree for each of five classes.  When I say pre-patch, I refer to the fact that when Diablo 2 first released, one of the chief complaints players had against it was that early skills in any given skill tree often felt like they served no purpose other than gating access to higher-level, and presumably better, skills later in the tree.  Towards the end of the game's life, later patches included an update that made earlier skills improve upon later ones in the same line of the tree, such that "maxing" those skills, or raising them as high as the game allowed, wasn't necessarily a waste of points, since it improved the function of a descendant.No such luck in Champions, as we get skills that not only have no impact on later skills in a tree beyond gating access to them, but skills that often seem as though they're only in a certain part of the tree because there wasn't any better place to put them.  With a little digging online, you can find out what each skill does for each class at each level (some classes share a skill, but with different levels of effectiveness by level for each).  However, the game itself has almost nothing to offer in that regard, as it only ever tells you what the current skill level does, and the next level, if it exists.  There is also a surprising lack of skill-boosting gear in the game, at least so far as we've played it.Combined with the all-sales-are-final approach to skill point management, the game progressively feels more and more punishing, as any skill point regret you may suffer can only be assuaged by starting over and being more miserly.  Not only do you have no real good idea how any given skill grows to its maximum level of 20, such as when it hits a point where you would personally consider it to be offering diminishing returns, but if you decide to really commit and dump a bunch of points in, only to discover you wish you hadn't, well.  Too bad.In action, skills are assigned by means of an eight-way radial menu, managed with the D-pad, in concert with either the Triangle or Circle buttons.  This menu can be arranged from the character sheet, and used while playing, without pausing, to assign skills to either button.  When the action ebbs, it's a passable enough system, which manages to pack a whole lot of skills into two teeny, tiny buttons.

Faulty junk. Crashes regularly and HDMI output cuts out. Fugly box with dust collecting slot all the way round it...
Cheap Chinese POS don't buy this knock off, the thumb sticks squeak loudly and it weighs 11oz less then the real one. I tore this apart after it broke in 2 weeks and nothing was salvageable. I tossed this in the fire pit. Don't waste your money on crap that is probably full of lead. Screw you china

I remember seeing previews for this game a couple of years ago; beautiful, sweeping lanscapes and dragons floating through the sky. I decided to buy the game about a year ago (I was poor, and waiting for the price drop). I had hoped that this could fill the void as I awaited the release of Final Fantasy X on the Playstation 2.Well, FFX has come and went, as have countless other games, and I STILL cannot muster the energy to put the sad, sad "Legend of Dragoon" out of its misery. I don't even know where to BEGIN damning this game, so let's begin at the beginning...Firstly, who in the WORLD conceived the lousy, pitiful soundtrack? From the opening title screen on, it seems as if the music was composed by some hair-metal band after a suicide attempt. And the plot? Can't Squaresoft sue? I mean, I have never seen a bigger ripoff of Final Fantasy VII, from the spiky haired lead character to the silver haired foe leading him by the nose across the world! Unfortunately for all, the results are far inferior to the Square offering...Also, who in the world TRANSLATED this thing? (I assume it is translated, I HOPE it is translated, I PRAY it is translated, sigh). Every character needs about a paragraph to say what could be thoroughly explained in a sentence. Does anyone even CARE about these characters? I sure don't...Oh, let's not forget the battle engine. Before every (RANDOM) encounter, the screen melts away like sand, followed by a sweeping camera laying out the poorly drawn field of battle, followed by a shot of the characters, and then one of the monsters. This happens before EVERY battle! I estimate a good ten hours of playtime is wasted just from this...Oh, and the battles? Don't even get me started. I will describe but one of the (uncountably infinite) shortcomings: a character can only cast magic while in the "dragoon" state. This makes every battle unbearably long, and expect to be hit with a random encounter every 5 seconds or so...I guess I'm left to ask, "What was the big deal?" Personally, I feel sorry for the schmoes who plunked down full price for this stinker (and apparently there were a lot of you; this game is a best-seller!). I suppose this is the reason for the ridiculously high rating this knockoff has received. Well, if there is anyone else thinking of buying this, DON'T! I hope the rant has dissuaded you! ZERO STARS!!!

Este juego es solo para ser jugado en red, tremenda limitante!!! Tomen esto en consideraci&oacute;n cuando decidan comprar este juego.
el material; deja bastante q descear no luce muy bien y la calidad es bastante pobre para ser un articulo oficial de sony y psvita
This game shows off the PS2's graphical prowess, or what passes for graphical prowess on a PS2.  The controls are very easy to pick up, and if you don't demand anything from your games then this will probably satisfy you.  However, I found that collecting power cells and eco was a tedious task rather beneath someone of my intellectual stature.  The physics of the game were astoundingly poor; who ever heard of a &quot;double jump&quot;?  Even on the moon, with its unique gravity, Neil Armstrong was unable to do a double jump, and so the suggestion that a spiky-haired cartoon character can transcend the laws of physics is both preposterous and offensive.Furthermore, it has been noted in countless reviews that Daxter, the sidekick, is not irritating, and even perhaps amusing.  Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong!  You plebians know nothing!  Daxter is the Newman of video games characters, the annoying sidekick that you hope will go away but never does.In conclusion, the game looks nice, plays nice, but is ultimately boring and undeserving of my attention.  Go play Dynasty Warriors or SSX Tricky instead!

The physics of the game were astoundingly poor; who ever heard of a &quot;double jump&quot;?  Even on the moon, with its unique gravity, Neil Armstrong was unable to do a double jump, and so the suggestion that a spiky-haired cartoon character can transcend the laws of physics is both preposterous and offensive.Furthermore, it has been noted in countless reviews that Daxter, the sidekick, is not irritating, and even perhaps amusing.  Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong!  You plebians know nothing!  Daxter is the Newman of video games characters, the annoying sidekick that you hope will go away but never does.In conclusion, the game looks nice, plays nice, but is ultimately boring and undeserving of my attention.  Go play Dynasty Warriors or SSX Tricky instead!
If you want a somewhat good wrestling game, consider ditching your junky PS2 and get a real game game console - XBOX! and get yourself WWF RAW, where there is at least some resemblence between the game models and the real wrestlers.

This is the worst outfit around in the MMOG world, and that is saying something.From game design, to playability, to long term appeal, their games are bottom of the barrel.And regarding customer service - forget about it! You are just a dollar figure to them, they don't give a you-know-what about anything else like improving their products or listening to feedback from their customers and making appropriate changes.For an example, go to the Sony station forums for Everquest 2. There you will see a section titled "The Glass House" (the title alone is a dead giveaway of SOE's attitude towards their customers), where customers who complain about EQ 2 threads are all locked and sent. This gives you an idea of what SOE thinks of their customers. If you don't love their game and act like a sycophant and praise every boneheaded decision they make, you are persona non grata.EQ 2 continues Sony Online Entertainment's abysmal track record.

Before playing this game you should play the preceding title of the series "The Mark of Kri" which is a truly fantastic game. It introduces a beautiful atmospheric world, unique controls, great action, and an interesting story. One of the best title's I've played for the PS2.That said, I have a bone or two to pick with the sequel here. I really wanted to give this game a shining review but I have to be honest with you. For the record I found this game to be quite beautiful like MoK and the controls were very much alike. I became accustomed to fighting alongside a computer controlled ally and learned to like it. I played as the new characters and came to like them too.The painful things about this game are the bugs/glitches! I've played a lot of PS2 titles, I can safely say that even among the worst titles I've played, none of them had this many bugs. What happened Sony? Did you pull the plug on this one and rush it to store shelves? Here's a list of bugs I have experienced commonly in this game:1. In stealth mode, half the time, enemies somehow magically see you when you're completely concealed around a corner.2. Floors disappear and stay gone during play, and make you appear as if you are walking on air. Sounds cool but it isn't. It's sloppy.3. Sometimes when you flip a switch and you computer ally attempts to flip it too, door jam closed instead of opening for you.4. Your character gets stuck in a wall sometimes permanently.5. When attempting to complete level challenges such as completing certain combos on enemies, the correctly and successfully performed combos will go undetected after dozens of attempts. (this one really irks me)6. You computer controlled partner freezes in place7. The entire game freezes.It's heartbreaking really. I love the series and the story but I can't help but get really frustrated at the sloppy programming behind this game. I expect more from Sony, especially since MoK was such a wonderful game. Try it at the very least.

**UPDATE June 27th, 2009: Not that anyone cares, but I take back some of what I said in this review back in 2006. Or at least I take back the overly hateful tone.I haven't played the game again, but I overreacted, and I feel stupid that I crapped all over a piece of art like Shadow of the Colossus. It's just that I enjoyed Ico so much - it's one my favorite games of all time - and I had a knee-jerk and emotional reaction to not getting Ico 2. One day I'm going to play SotC again, and I still don't think I'll like it as much as Ico, but this review sounds very immature.**Old original review:It's probably my fault but I was hugely disappointed in this game. I was hoping for something more along the lines of Ico since the makers of this game also made that one. Ico was one of the best games I've played on the PS2, up there with one of my all time favorites. A beautitful game filled with challenging puzzles and tons of emotion and atmosphere. For Collosus They kept the beautiful, artistic graphics and same look and feel yet dumped everything else. All that's left is riding around on a horse with absolutely nothing to do in between fighting the collosi. No I'm not looking for wave after wave of meaningless monsters and fights. This is an unfinished game. I really believe the developers started with this outline but couldn't finish perhaps because their ideas were too grandiose. This is a demo.The horse is an excellent idea and everything about is well done so it's a shame it goes to waste. Fighting each collosus is interesting and fun, but after 5 or 6 of them it's gets very repetitive. You spend time and energy finally figuring out their patterns and weak spots, which is good in itself, but you get nothing for your effort except to do it all over again.Come on let's stop with all the way overboard rave reviews here. Someone said it's like "Ico meets Metroid Prime." Stop it, it's nothing like Metroid Prime and all the stuff that made Ico good was taken out. I know I'm going to get a lot of negative votes for this review but somebody has to step up and give an alternate opinion and warn Ico players before they waste their money.The bottom line: Ico was a fantastic, once in a lifetime game filled with umatched atmosphere, emotion and gameplay. Surely something close to Ico 2 would be made right? No, Ico didn't sell all that well. Water it down, take out the complexity and puzzles. Fight big monsters. Ride horse. There ya go, Shadow has been a best seller. What a disgrace.
This game is absolutely horrendous.  You go back and forth to the same ugly looking dungeon looking for georama pieces.  On top of that he gets thirsty every 30 seconds and is sword breaks which makes it weaker.  Very very annoying.  What is up with the building of the town?  I want to play an RPG not sit there and build a town.  If I wanted to manage a town I would go play Sim City or something like that.  I bought this game a  while ago, and played for a total of about 2-3 hours before saying &quot;screw this&quot; and shelving it forever.  I recently bought a game called ICO, which is also made by Sony, now that is a masterpiece (Sony's redemption).  This is a horrible title, go buy ICO instead you'll be happier...trust me.

Okay, here's the gist of things.  EQ finally got to a point where it was almost bug free.......then out comes ROK.  They still run patch after patch trying to fix little problems, and graphics glitches....and then they come out with yet ANOTHER expansion?  Don't we get the picture yet?  It's not about quality of gameplay, people.........it's about the bottom line.  I could go into a 5 page dissertation on why I despise Verant and their company, and why the majority of people who are looking for a good gameplaying experience will walk away shaking their heads sadly....at the potential wasted, but I digress.  Fix the car before doing a brand new paint job.  Otherwise, you have something that LOOKS real great.......but goes nowhere.

This mark of kri game is fun but only like three levels long! This has plenty of blood, gore, and violance for me but it is just too short for me. The good thing is though I only bought it for two bucks at game stop!! So overall this game is fun but too short!
