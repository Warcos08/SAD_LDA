Sim Copter is a quite old game (1997). The idea is that you start out with A helicopter and some money, you need too complete missions to earn more to buy new copters, and accesories. After you've completed all the missions you move on to the next city with tougher missions (and more money). The gameplay is OK but the controls aer'nt very realistic. The graphics are horrific the cars, sims, and some buildings arent even textured . The music and the sound effects are lacking and there's no ambiant sound. You can upload SimCity 2000 cities and play in them but its useless with SimCity 3000. The game does have quite A few bugs, sims can get stuck, your pilot can get stuck too and if you do it right your pilot can jump out right as your taking off and your copter will crash. Overall this game is OK but maxis ought to remake it with better graphics, less bugs, more levels and stuff to buy, and to work with SimCity 3000 cities. But you still should'nt get it there's just to many problems.

This game was'nt fun for me at all.  It was to hard riding the bike and it's just a boring game overall.  Planing to trade it in for beowulf.
But it is a very bad game. The story is barley there,you pick a hero/villian and fight 7 people. Thats about it, there is a little paragraph tellin you about your enemy like what he/she is doing and who they work for. The sound is decent pretty low quality but it is'nt completely terrible, the only saving grace is the graphics, while cool it doesnt save the game and, as much as i was hoping for a good game this one falls flat.

What a snoozefest! Whenever a game review includes "Fun for the whole family", that is always a good warning sign. Most of these Blockbuster-movie based games are usually pretty lame but this one is actually playable; this is probably why people are gushing all over it. It does not mean that it is good, no way! Harry Potter is just a well polished, slapped together, cash-in quick game. Parents will be forced to buy it, so it will automatically generate alot of cash. It really does'nt need mine.

First off, this game features the most downright ugly hero you'll ever see.The controls are sluggish and annoying. 'Ammond runs like a Thunderbirds puppet and it becomes a feat in itself to simply move about.Can't run and shoot. Very innovative. When you stand still, the baddies shoot you. Go figure.In this realistic game, our gormless hero can't open doors, jump over foot-high blockades (or jump at all) and recovers from shotgun blasts to the face by leaning against walls.The game isn't 'fun' in the same way GTA is- the car chase bits are deathly dull, due to the fact that you'll crash into a car or pole every ten seconds. The cops can't pull you out of your car either, so it's more of an endurance test than a challenge, just keep ploughing along.The regular cars barely move at all, only the Lexuses and sportscars are worth jacking.No camera angles in the car sections, so mission briefs like "Bring the triads to our HQ, and make sure that they follow you" are nonsensical as you cant look behind you. No onscreen maps or info either. Or ammo counts for that matter.Everything is so big on the screen- compare the feeling of space that you have around you in GTA with this. In GTA, traffic and baddies can be seen approaching, whereas in this they appear right on you.Again, the 'lean-against-a-wall-to-gain-energy' system. Even the non playable characters comment that you're standing around like an idiot. Sorry love, can't help it.Glitchy graphics. A friend of mine encountered a horde of giants in Hyde Park who shrunk to midgets once neared. Is perspective reversal common in the UK?Negotiating stairwells cause 'Ammond to perform a very camp jig. Can't the man just bound up them with dignity?And so on and so on...

looks gorgous, boring shooter.
I, too, was excited about Spore until I heard about the DRM. That's a dealbreaker.

Prepare yourself for this game. It's not what you think.I had read all the ballyhoo about it and it was perhaps my heightened expectations that ultimately let me down when I first started playing it.First of all, it's pretty much the same game. The core values are the same, the way it works is the same; not much has changed from 3000 to SC4.Yes it's prettier graphically ... I like to equate it to the changeover from Windows 3.1 to 95 -- but only on a visual level. The add-on functions of SC4 are pretty slim. The game playing changes unnoticeable.One of the &quot;changes&quot; is the importation of your SIMS from The SIMS. Before I purchased this game I had visions of watching my imported SIMS walk into stores (like in Hot Date) in SC4 and see them go about their daily lives, but on a much bigger scale -- a whole growing city.Be warned, this is not the case at all. You import your SIMS, they live in a neighborhood and then proceed to bug the hell out of you about various things they're thinking. Import one and he's a chatterbox. Import the six they offer and it's a veritable zoo. You know how annoying pop-up ads are on the Internet? Think that. It's about the same.Don't even think about installing pipes in your city. They'll spring a leak every two seconds (even if you have water utilities fully funded) and destroy surrounding neighborhood housing.Fully funded police stations are lazy. You have to direct them to the crimes and have them pick up the criminals. There's no patrolling with these boys.Drop funding a tiny bit for the firestations and they're out protesting with picket signs. It's cute for the first five minutes.It seems that Maxis has forgotten what was attractive about its games in the first place and is now only after a buck. This trend started with the runaway smash hit that was The Sims and followed with (what? we're up to six?) upgrade packages -- all providing extras that should have been in their initial game in the first place -- or at the very least combined into one extra service package upgrade ... six is tantamount to exploitation of its consumer's wallets.The same goes with SC4. While it is prettier visually, it's not the blowout wunderkind game you're expecting. Get it only if you're a HUGE fan of SimCity, or if you've never played SimCity before ... otherwise, it'll likely let you down the same way it did with me.

Only a baffoon would not see this coming.  If it can't even handle Deus Ex 1 and Rainbow Six 3, what makes you think it's going to be able to run a halo clone.  Call up any psychic, they'll tell you the same thing I'm telling you.  Sattle up the syrup boys, we are headed to the flopzone.

BUYERS BEWARE:  Brett Favre is not in this game.  I got this game thinking Brett Favre was in it, but Brett Favre was not in it.  Also it was really hard to get the plastic wrap and stickers off the case.  Not happy.  At all.  Get the Madden with Brett Favre on the cover.
NHL 2004 shows some signs of being a quality game, but lacks far too much to actually achieve this. Some features were improved, others took a step backwards and the result is an average at best game that could have and should have been so much more.We'll start with the gameplay. The computer is able to use this incredible little &quot;Hold/Hook&quot; feature to get the puck from you at will. Last I checked Holding and Hooking were penalties, but the computer is hardly penalized for these infractions. Naturally you might think that turning around and hooking/holding them would be successful, but don't worry, the computer is able to skate right through hooks and holds. This leads to many frustrating encounters as the computer effortlessly strips you of the puck while you have to bash a computer guy through the glass to get the puck from him.The passing can also be frustrating, guys often cut or spontaneously change their direction after you fire off the pass. I thought I had finally got passing down, was getting 80-85% passing and then I was hit with a game in which I completed a whole 56% of passes. As far as I know I didn't change anything. The nature of the beast? At any rate, passing, while it isn't guarenteed anymore (that's good) is perhaps a bit too random now.The camera angles are also rather poor. I don't know why EA messed with it's cameras, but for any of the vertical camera angles the &quot;up&quot; net and the area behind the &quot;up&quot; net is impossible to find the puck in.The off-ice features are a mess as well. First of all, no more NHL Cards. OK, OK, so you never used them anyway right? But you could unlock stuff with certain cards and earning points to buy card packs was a nice extra element. Well all that is gone. Instead in NHL 2004 there is a menu option called &quot;Unlockables&quot;. Oh, how original. I believe it is tied in with your EA Sports Bio and periodically it pops up and gives you a new unlockable. Exciting, isn't it?Now how about that new Dynasty mode you ask yourself? Well, it's a start at a good mode but is riddled with problems. First of all is this upgrade stuff. You get your team in a crippled state, their facilities are horrible and you have to use upgrades to get them to average and then beyond. Until you do that's a big ol -10 OV to your players. But every other GM faces this problem too, so the playing field is level ... everyone just plays with slow 70-75 OV players until they get their facilities up.Of course, that'll take about 35 more upgrade points than you start with, so you'll need 3500 exp points. That'd be 350 trades or 1750 wins. Win a Stanley Cup or two along the way and it's probably only 500 wins.That's not the only problem either. Dynasty Mode conviently forgets to mention when players are injured and refuses to even give you an injury estimate. Perhaps this may be related to the medical upgrades, but I should still be able to know if he's in serious health trouble or not. The effect of back to back games on your players is also ridiculous, don't expect to win the back end of any back to backs: your players are literally pylons out there.The big effort of NHL 2004 seemed to go into its Dynasty Mode. This means the other features are very bare bones and you really must use Dynasty Mode to get anything worthwhile out of the game. Unforetunately, while Dynasty Mode had some good ideas the execution wasn't there. And sadly the gameplay certainly isn't about to &quot;hook or hold&quot; you in where the features fail (haha haha ha ...)The motto of NHL 2004: It had some good ideas, but the execution just wasn't there.

This game is a waste of time to play after you get to blacklist member #5 JV. In the milestone section where you have to hit 28 cop cars and then evade them you can't cause they either run you into walls, have too many cops on you or spiked roadblocks you don't know about until is too late.  According to my husband you have to play this game for more than 500 hours a day.
This game surprised me. Loved the graphics, had an interesting story, but I gave up on this game for the simple fact, I can't get into a game that promotes gratuitous violence by depicting cops and orher drivers smashing cars in high speed pursuits. The story to me was too violent and depicting police in a bad way. I like car games mostly Gran  turismo titles. That is more to my taste. I may bump the car up, but I'm not trying to do a demolition derby.  I do appreciate the people who sold me the game. My assessment is of the game itself, not the people who sold it.
I bought this game like day or or 2 after the fay it came out and i was all exited when i was installing it had this little game of some sort to entertain you will it installs the 4 discs but when i was done installing it it said "Failed to find DirectX 9.0c compatible graphics adapters in this system! Please make sure you have DirectX 9.0c compatible graphics adapter and have installed the latest drivers by the manufacturer. The application will now terminate." i was shocked because i was waiting a long time to play this game and i have not played it on my computer because of this error.i suggest that you do not buy this game unless you have a new computer or all upgraded things on your computer

I have been a simpsons fanatic for the past 5 years and am humiliated by this ...video game. for 1 thing the Simpsons is a great show so it shouldnt have a scummy video game like this one. they must have been on a low budget making the game. Here are 5 good reasons why this game shouldnt have been invented 1. The graphics are bland, their entrances to the car are absurd. (Hans Moleman doing a flip into a car?!) 2. The mission mode is unbelieveably sinchy. 3. They dont even have all of the characters. (No Patty + Selma, no Julius Hibbert, No Lenny + Carl to name a few) 4. The lines get dull + repetitive in 10 minutes and most of the lines are from old simpsons episodes. 5. This is just [an]... imitation of some game i forget the name of........ oh yeah, CRAZY TAXI!!!!!! I rest my case.

Ummm... no thanks. I don't care HOW pretty it is, I, as well as just about every EQ player I know (and I know many of them) all agree: The timesinks stop at EQ1. There will be no starting over for any reason. We've all invested too much time on EQ1 to just drop it and move forward, especially with Sony's infamously horrific customer service.I am a paying beta tester for Everquest (in my opinion that game still hasn't left beta, and since I pay to play it, well, that makes me a paid beta tester doesn't it hehe). I will not pay Sony for the privaledge of testing their new game.IF Sony was smart, they would make Everquest II a complete rewrite of EQ1 with this fabled new engine of theirs and allow people to import the characters into it that they have worked so incredibly hard on.EQ2 is going to be a total loser, mark my words--regardless of it's prettiness or features. It will be another Anarchy Online, UO2 (ummm WHAT UO2? heh), Dark Ages of Camelot, etc. It simply will never reach critical mass because EQ1 players will NOT switch in droves like they are hoping.Sony is crazy to make EQ2 incompatible with EQ1. Not smart at all.It truly seems that the "soul" of Verant has left the building, in a big way, since their acquisition.

When EQ2 came out I screamed horray!!!! But as I played it I felt let down, betrayed, scammed, etc. I switch over to WOW and I am having a good time, but graphics are toonish though.Do not waste your money!

This is the buggiest game I've ever purchased, and it does not stand up to EA Games shining (but rapidly fading) history.  For example:  I've been stuck on a rooftop early in the game covering some guy name Klaus while he picks the lock on a door.  Meanwhile, Nazis are coming out of the woodwork.  After about the 10th try, he finally opens the door and we go to the bottom of the stairs where . . . nothing happens.  The game is stuck.  I cannot walk past him, and he just stands there.  I go back outside and nothing happens for several minutes.  Eventually the Nazis show back up and I run out of ammo.  This makes no sense because we supposedly on a covert mission, and we should be running away once through the door.In addition, the graphics engine is severely showing its age, and overall the gameplay, AI, etc. is way behind.

Before playing this game you should play the preceding title of the series "The Mark of Kri" which is a truly fantastic game. It introduces a beautiful atmospheric world, unique controls, great action, and an interesting story. One of the best title's I've played for the PS2.That said, I have a bone or two to pick with the sequel here. I really wanted to give this game a shining review but I have to be honest with you. For the record I found this game to be quite beautiful like MoK and the controls were very much alike. I became accustomed to fighting alongside a computer controlled ally and learned to like it. I played as the new characters and came to like them too.The painful things about this game are the bugs/glitches! I've played a lot of PS2 titles, I can safely say that even among the worst titles I've played, none of them had this many bugs. What happened Sony? Did you pull the plug on this one and rush it to store shelves? Here's a list of bugs I have experienced commonly in this game:1. In stealth mode, half the time, enemies somehow magically see you when you're completely concealed around a corner.2. Floors disappear and stay gone during play, and make you appear as if you are walking on air. Sounds cool but it isn't. It's sloppy.3. Sometimes when you flip a switch and you computer ally attempts to flip it too, door jam closed instead of opening for you.4. Your character gets stuck in a wall sometimes permanently.5. When attempting to complete level challenges such as completing certain combos on enemies, the correctly and successfully performed combos will go undetected after dozens of attempts. (this one really irks me)6. You computer controlled partner freezes in place7. The entire game freezes.It's heartbreaking really. I love the series and the story but I can't help but get really frustrated at the sloppy programming behind this game. I expect more from Sony, especially since MoK was such a wonderful game. Try it at the very least.

Did you pull the plug on this one and rush it to store shelves? Here's a list of bugs I have experienced commonly in this game:1. In stealth mode, half the time, enemies somehow magically see you when you're completely concealed around a corner.2. Floors disappear and stay gone during play, and make you appear as if you are walking on air. Sounds cool but it isn't. It's sloppy.3. Sometimes when you flip a switch and you computer ally attempts to flip it too, door jam closed instead of opening for you.4. Your character gets stuck in a wall sometimes permanently.5. When attempting to complete level challenges such as completing certain combos on enemies, the correctly and successfully performed combos will go undetected after dozens of attempts. (this one really irks me)6. You computer controlled partner freezes in place7. The entire game freezes.It's heartbreaking really. I love the series and the story but I can't help but get really frustrated at the sloppy programming behind this game. I expect more from Sony, especially since MoK was such a wonderful game. Try it at the very least.

this is one of the most overrated piles of tripe ive ever playedthe graphics are pretty but you'll need a pretty hefty card and processor to get the most out of them. my voodoo3 450mhz struggled almost constantlythe gamneplay, although hyped up something massive is dull at best. it just boils down to the people want wood so put some trees in the store. the people want food so put some food in the store. the other god wants you to get more land, put food and wood in another village's store. etc...sound is good but it doesnt reallt matter considering the rest of the game is so dullthe creatures although made to seem like real children are boring and essentially boils down to ape picks up man, god slaps ape, ape goes &quot;ooh&quot;, ape picks up another man. etc... i suppose eventually the ape will learn not to pick up the man but you'll have flogged this game by then.my rating: zipmaybe 4/5 if you coiuld use the cd as a coaster maybe

I love RPGs. The PS2 has produced some really excellent games for the genre including Final Fantasy X, the Shadow Hearts series, and Disgea: Hour of Darkness. Wild Arms 3 is not going to be joining this list of RPG awesomeness any time soon. It's not even going to be joining my list of decent RPGs. This game is terrible, and I just could not finish it! Trust me I tried and there was a period of two weeks when I couldn't bring myself to even turn the game on.I thought a western-themed RPG would be something really unique, but I was wrong. This has got to be one of the most cliched things I've ever seen. It's the third in a series that appears to be rather popular. I did end up hating this game, but strangely I'm not totally put off from playing a Wild Arms game ever again. Maybe since this is the third game, it's just an unfortunate casuality of sequel-itis.The Good:The music's pretty good. It's appropriately whistlely and twangy like the fare you'd find in most spagetti westerns and really sets the western tone.Fighting on horseback! This only unique from a visual point of view. The game still plays in exactly the same turn-based Final Fantasy-esque way as if you were on foot, but it looks really cool as you race across the desert fending off creepies.Save Anywhere! You can provided you have an item called a Gimel Coin, but luckily those are easy to find.The Bad:Cliched plot. It starts out with promise. Your four heroes meet up during a train robbery when some burly gunmen try to steal an artifact belonging to this Indian Shaman tribe called the Baskars. Classic Western! Then the adventurers, called Drifters, team up and take an assignment from the Baskar's head Shaman to awaken the four guardians of the planet Filgaia so maybe the desertification of the planet will stop. It's down hill from there. Suddenly, instead of a Western game, I'm playing a cliched find the four scared elemental crystals/dragons/betamax VCRs quest.... but with firearms! Soon our foursome discovers that this weird demon cult is out to infuse the planet with evil energy and transform it into a demon world or some other rot by using guardians and ancient artifacts. So they set out, to discover why Filgaia is dying and play follow-the-bad guys. It's almost like playing Final Fantasy VII over again, and I never liked that game much in the first place.Characters that come right out of anime central casting. The characters are very archetypal and never try to break out of their mold. You have Gallows, a ne'er-do-well Shaman, who learns some bland lesson on freedom, heritage, and self-actualization on the journey. Brainy, tough guy Clive, who might have been a better drawn character if his marital troubles were explored in more detail. Jet Enduro, surly anti-social amnesiac, and worst of the bunch Virginia Maxwell. For some reason they make her their leader even though she is the least expirenced of the bunch. She's naive, gulliable, and not all that smart trusting people she should know better than to trust and walking into obvious traps. She's one of those annoyingly perky types and her "Come on guys! Let's do our best for Justice, Truth, and blah blah" is more Big Bird than Clint Eastwood. She's also looking for the dead-beat dad she hasn't seen in 10 years. The anime feel is helped along by the video sequences (complete with corny songs) that sandwich the game when you begin and end it during each period of play. Trust me. It's frickk'n annoying after you've seen them ten times.Sandcraft battles. During the game you get a sandcraft vehicle. If you run into a monster in this thing, the way the battles plays out is very different than on foot or horseback. That's not good because they battles are so bloody slow that they can last for over five minutes each!The Ugly:Healing Items are hard to find. Healing Items are scarce, so it becomes neccesary to ration stretigically. There are some sections of the game that are so hard that having a big cache of heal berries is the only way to stay alive. It adds challenge, but since I didn't enjoy the game it just it that more annoying.Search system. If you want to find something on the map, you need to get directions first and move slowly across the map sending out some kind of sonar to make the ruin, town, or whatever appear. It's time consuming and also makes the game extremely linear.Boring Level Design. You'll send more of you're time trekking through the various ruins that litter the landscape. In the ruins, you solve various puzzles ranging from easy to what am I supposed to do here? difficulty. A critic once said level design was key, and Wild Arms 3 makes me see how right he was. All the ruins look exactly the same. I know I'm throwing a switch in the ruin in the North, but I did the exact same thing in the ruin to the South which also had a box puzzle like the ruin in the West.  Get my point? It feels like I'm doing the same thing over and over again. I'm not traveling to a Forest of Doom or a Cloud City of Eternal Happiness. It's just ruins and towns, and they all look the same!

Despite the highly impressive introductory scene and menu screen, don't be deceived.  This game is far too conventional and undeniably sloppy.  Terrible low quality graphics and messy animation, lifeless paper diorama-like environments, corny cliched looped background 'noise' which fails to evoke a dark, haunting atmosphere.  The controls can become extremely confusing and frustrating in times of crisis (plenty of mutilation, blood spillage and cleavage wobbling though).  The characters are in many ways stereotyped and dull yet cheaply sexy and appealing (in the busty exotic bombshell type way - a cross between Elvira and Mortal Kombat's Sonya Blade).The concept and storyline (or lack of) is shallow and focuses more on show-casing stereotypical gothic style, lacking substance and depth.It's a shame, this game potentially could've been much better.  It certainly doesn't do justice for the X-box either...  It's still an appealing short-lasting novelty like playing old platformers for nostalgic value.  It's fun and wasteful but certainly not for those who want a worthwhile challenge.

This game is regularly voted as one of the worst video games of all time (if not THE worst), and I won't argue with that, but I think that the game is actually strangely fascinating. It's so bad it's actually comical! In fact, it's even almost like it was intended to be that way (although I'm sure it wasn't). The game has a storyline that makes minus zero sense. The way it starts is, Shaq is in Japan before a charity basketball game, and he comes to this karate dojo (by the way, there is a bit of prominent Pepsi product placement [how's that for alliteration?] here), where an old man informs him that he (Shaq, that is) is the Magic One, and that he (again, Shaq) must go into another dimension to rescue some kid named Nezu. Then Shaq goes through this portal into the other dimension. The story begs multitudinous questions, and never answers a single one (unless I've missed or forgotten something, or more than one thing). Some examples: Just why is Shaq (the "Magic One") the ONLY one who can rescue Nezu? Why can't anyone else do it? Why was Nezu kidnapped in the first place? Why is there a portal to the other dimension inside the dojo? How does the old man know that Shaq is the Magic One (that is, the one who must rescue Nezu)? This next question doesn't really have so much to do with the story, but just exactly how do you pronounce "Nezu"? ("NEZ-oo"? "NEE-zoo"? "NAY-zoo"?) If I tried to list all of the questions that the storyline (and other things in the game) make me ask, the list would probably go on for miles before I finished it! As for the actual "game" part, I really don't think that it looks or sounds that bad (although MANY other games, including other SNES games, have done MUCH better). I wouldn't say that the controls are that good, though. Your opponents are really bizarre --- a catlady, a mummy (who is the main bad guy), and assorted other weirdos. Before each match, you and your opponent engage in a bit of smack talking --- bad smack talking, at that. It seems that your opponents all have much better moves than you do; they can whip your butt in no time. I find it odd that Shaq has no basketball-related moves; shouldn't he at least have the ability to throw basketballs at his opponents? (By the way, get a load of the mummy guy's name: Sett Ra. Those who are familiar with ancient Egyptian deities, or at least their names, will probably get a laugh out of that.) And, for those of you who may not want the ending of the game spoiled, SKIP THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH!The game ends as ridiculously as it begins (almost). Shaq returns to Earth (with Nezu) in time for that charity basketball game --- and who is there at the game but Shaq's enemies from the other dimension (or at least a couple of them, anyway). Then Shaq dishes out a little more smack talk, and that's it.Overall, a supremely cheesy game. It really makes no sense that Shaq is even on the game. The game indeed appears to have been mainly just a cheap attempt to cash in on Shaq's (then-)celebrity, as he was very big at the time; making a truly good game (let alone one where Shaq's presence actually makes sense) doesn't seem to have been a priority. If you like games with storylines that make actual sense (any sense at all), this definitely isn't one of those games. If you like games that play really well, this isn't one of those games, either. But if you just want a game that is good for a few laughs (even if that was unintentional), this game might work for you, though it certainly isn't worth paying much for.

Legend of Dragoon is one of those games that you either love or despise, I of course belong to the later group.As one reviewer already mentioned, Legend of Dragoon was Sony's answer to rival Square-Enix's insanely popular Final Fantasy VII. I have to laugh when it took them three years to cook up this title that can't even dent the Final Fantasy fanchise.I don't think the Final Fantasy series is the greatest thing since sliced bread (I actually like the Wild Arms series the most), but the only thing Legend of Dragoon really had going for it was its graphics, which I will admit where pretty sweet at the time.Outside the graphical engine, Legend of Dragoon is second rate RPG in every category. Lame enemies, lackluster story, generic locations, and some of the worst music to ever accompany an PSX RPG ever (it's really that bad). Fights are also annoying due to the so-called "Additions" system which has you doing timed hits all day (yeah, that's what I call fun when I have to hit a button 8 times in a row at just the correct moment just to attack).Other problems also arise, such as the fact no one can use magic outside of their dragoon transformations, meaning their is really no way to heal your characters except for items (which you become way too dependent on in this game, and can only carry so many). Outside the dragoon tranformations the battle system is very weak.Play Legend of Dragoon only after you have destroyed every other PSX PRG. By that time you'll realize that this is not what any and all PSX RPG's should be compared against. Even if Final Fantasy is extremely overrated at times, even the worst FF is better than this. I don't think I'll play this one again.

The Road to Rome is an expansion pack forBattlefield: 1942(BF1942). It covers the Italian campaign. It comes with 6 new maps and two new armies (French and Italians). These armies can only be used on certain maps. The expansion also has an assortment of new weapons and vehicles which again are only for use on certain maps. These includes for the Americans M3 Grant (medium tank) and M3 GMC (tank destroyer/mobile artillery), for the British the Mosquito (bomber) and the 25pdr (stationary AT gun), for the Italians the M11-39 Carro Armato (medium tank), and for the Germans the Sturmgeschutz (tank destroyer),PAK75 (stationary AT gun), and the BF 110 (fighter/bomber). Two infantry assault weapons include the British Sten SMG and the Italian Breda Modello 30. The maps are fun and fairly well balanced. I would also note that even though this is very old title there is still an active multiplayer community. I was able to jump right into a multiplayer game with no lag. However, there are very few servers that actually play the expansions.The biggest question is really is it worth getting. If you already have BF1942, I wouldn't bother unless you are a diehard fan.  But if you are looking at getting  BF1942 then getBattlefield 1942: World War II Anthologywhich comes with this expansion andBattlefield 1942: Secret Weapons of WWII Expansion Packor getBattlefield 1942: The Complete Collectionwhich comes with both expansions andBattlefield: Vietnam.

I own all the expansions except Hot Date, and this is the first in the series that is badly bugged and unstable.  In Windows 98 it drops to desktop frequently, some Sims become completely unusable as certain crashes happen at the same spot for that Sim every time.  You could lose your entire family if you have 98 and use this expansion.Under XP it doesn't crash but there are still nagging problems:- the 'superfast' clock speed, the one that pops up automatically and you cannot go to yourself, frequently stops in mid-day or mid-night for no reason.- Water leaks under toilets and tubs and cannot be cleaned up by the Sims (though the maid gets it).- The movement AI was never good, but now it's even worse than before.- Neighborhood stray pets are a nuisance, especially skunks and el bandito (racoon), though I've had fewer burglars so they may merely replace burglars.- Sims seem to need substantially more sleep than before.  I had a steady schedule for my family, and now I have lost an hour or so due to new, higher sleep requirements.If you have Windows 98 I'd pass on this expansion rather than risk losing my existing families.If you have XP I wonder whether the game adds more than it subtracts in problems.  The pets are okay, and the larger neighborhood is nice ...

Rushhour is CRUCIAL to the satisfactory play of Simcity 4. The game was released as the game, then this Rushhour expansion , then the combination (called SC4 Deluxe).

This game was released about 2003 and developed over the 5 years prior to that. It also is completely unsupported by its "owners" EA (which bought it from Maxis)and has been for pushing a decade (it is a "cash cow" only). It is out of it's element on todays machines. The game is single-threaded and has its own scheduler. It is not well-adapted to a multitasking environment. It also can be rather snarky in getting along with some graphics cards. This means it has some real quirks and issues such as occasional failures to save, or lost cities, or "crash to desktop" (CTD's). On the other hand these can be countered by frequent saves and backups along with certain "habits" in the play methodology.If one does this, this game has some real appeal to many people.The game was released as a core game, Simcity 4 (SC4) and an expansion, Rush Hour (RH) which in combination was dubbed "Simcity 4 Deluxe" SC4D. The Rushhour expansion used to be available seperately, but is quite scarce and/ or very expensive nowSimCity 4: Rush Hour Expansion Pack.This particular release is only SC4 and frankly is essentially unusable by itself as much of the elements of the game, and much of the expanded customizable hooks, especially the "networks" part.. that part which handles the commuting and travel mechanics, allowing a wide array of "transportation" simulations. To be really useful you MUST (IMO) have the FULL set available in several forms (see below). My low rating is for THIS VERSION ONLY. I really quite like the game itself in its full, properly-registered form.There also is a very active community, especially in the USA, Germany and Japan and lessor followings in many other countries. This group is very community oriented and supportive. Maxis was clever to embed into the game "stubs" which support a wide array of end user customization content, and this community generates active interest which carries the game well beyond its years. This group congregates on a half dozen or so "support sites" (all free) which are accessable by all. I'd estimate there are probably about a half million fairly active players worldwide.The game is not played versus other players (other than in comparing accomplishments or progress or sharing custom content). It is a "strategy" game based on figuring out the operation and biases of the game and designing your city designs to best overcome and conform to these needs. There isn't "an answer" but rather a broad array of approaches that work to varying degrees based on what you are trying to achieve (dense ghettos, idylic contryside, sleepy towns, etc) A single "regional development" can easily take weeks to months of off and on attention to work through these issues. If these kinds of things appeal to you, this may be the game for you, just not in this version.The game uses a copy protection scheme that requires the CD to be in the machine to play (or in the downloadable Amazon or Steam versions a running "game support" program that validates the game) Some folk are rather put off by this.In summary, though this is still the core of the game, DON'T BUY THIS VERSION.. buy the full set.SimCity 4 Deluxe Editionor the downloadable versionSimCity 4 Deluxe Edition [Download] (also available via Steam) or as a subset of a box set with other games includedThe SimCity BoxI have heard there are support problems with the patches on the box set, but don't  have personal experience with it.

You know what I love about The Sims?  I enjoy builing houses and adding furniture as my income increases.  I also enjoy enhancing my Sims skills and advancing them in their jobs.  I do not enjoy just watching them interact so that I can "play house." Because of that, The Sims Vacation was the last expansion I bought because it disappointed me for the same reasons the Hot Date expansion did.  I'm sure there are people that love to role-play their Sims in new downtown districts (i.e. Hot Date) or hotel resorts (i.e. Vacation) but I found both of those additions boring.  It's already hard enough to keep all the Sims hygiene, social and other tabs updated, and it becomes even more difficult when you take your Sims on vacation.  Sure, it's interesting for a few minutes to watch your Sims ride an attraction or another expansion feature but it's not what made the game fun for me in the first place.  I would only recommend this expansion for the diehard fans of The Sims series.  I'd check out The Sims Unleashed or The Sims Superstar expansion packs (the two most recent expansions) first because they seem to focus on normal gameplay enhancements instead of the "side attractions" that make up The Sims Vacation or The Sims Hot Date.  Of course, if you only want new decorations and furniture, Vacation adds it own fair share of the normal expansion extras.  Honestly, I'd wait for the next deluxe edition that packages several expansions together.  With the upcoming sequel, you can expect some good deals as The Sims tries to repackage all sequels for one last sales push.  Or you can just wait for the sequel which will be out in a few months and has the same gameplay but much better graphics.

Yes cause he's f**king you over rather ya like it or not. The controlls are not very good but you know this is a bad game when your storyline is I stumbled upon a Dojo an old man says fight for me this was made when Shaq was with the Magic so the old man says you are the magic 1 so you fight a cat huminoid a boogger Sheets a dude from Aku Locka Polkistan a chick who uses voodoo guess what her name is Voodoo Beast and the boss Sett Ra a boss so stupid he would even be passable for a Killer Instinct character. M Bison and Shao Khan were better Bosses cheap but beatable and your attacks are difficult to pull off but everybody attacks you and there specials are more powerful this would have been a decent arcade game but but play it for 2 player mode and the bad 1 liners at the end of everty fight. Good game if you need a good laugh.

As anyone reading this review is doubtless aware, this game is based on the third installment in the Harry Potter movie franchise, which is in turn based off the third book in the Harry Potter series.  This one concerns the third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley as they attend class, learn new spells, fight various enemies, and - by the way - deal with the fact that the notorious wizard criminal, Sirius Black, has escaped from Azkaban prison with the intent to murder young Mr. Potter, and he is being pursued by Dementors, which are Ringwraith-like creatures that act as prison guards and they are intent on recapturing Sirius Black, and woe to anyone who gets in their way.This is my second foray into the world of Harry Potter gaming.  About a year ago I played Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, which was a great (though not perfect) game with a well-realized, immersive Hogwarts, lots of challenging combat, fun sidequests and mini-games, Quidditch matches, good-looking graphics, and engaging puzzles.  I went in to Prisoner of Azkaban expecting more of the same.  I was rudely shocked, to say the least.But before I get into the negative, let's talk about the positive.  In this game, you control Harry, Ron, and Hermione at various times, and each of the three has different strengths and abilities.  Harry has access to the Marauder's Map, which allows you to see mini-maps or the levels, complete with secret passageways and locations of other characters and enemies.  Harry is also able to jump gaps, climb ropes, and is generally the most acrobatic of the trio.  Ron can find secret doors and items.  Hermione can access tight spaces that the others can't.  In addition, though this game offers many spells to be learned and used, most of them can only be used by one or another of the three characters (though the basic spells are common to all three).  All of this does make for a more varied gameplay experience, and adds a certain amount of depth to the (still too easy) puzzle-solving.  Another positive thing about the game is the Expecto Patronus spell, which allows Harry to conjure up a Patronus to use against the Dementors.  This is very well done and is the most enjoyable thing in the game, although controlling the Patronus effectively will take some getting used to.  But that's about it as far as positives go.Combat in this game is much easier than before.  Your Expelliarmus spell for defense will almost never be used.  The basic approach to any enemy is just cast Filipendo at it over and over again until it goes down.  This is complicated by the fact that your lock-on targeting system in clearly flawed in this game, as many times you will attempt to target an enemy and lock on to an inanimate object instead.  A couple of the enemies are slightly more challenging, but for the post part it is just point and shoot.  This even applies to the several times you will encounter Draco Malfoy in the game.  Malfoy is no more difficult to defeat than any other enemy in the game.  This doubtless makes the game easier for young players, but it was a disappointment for me.The puzzles in the game are very easy for the most part.  They are made even easier by the fact that the characters will continuously shout out things like "I wonder what that button does, maybe you should push it!" or "Hey Ron, why don't you cast Lumos Duo on that object over there?" or other such things.  So if you should ever experience some momentary hesitation about what to do next, don't worry - the game will spill the beans quickly enough.The most annoying thing about the game is the fact that, whichever of the three characters you are playing, the other two will constantly run along behind you shouting unhelpful and annoying remarks.  For example, when you have completed all the tasks assigned to you for a level, but you need to explore the castle a bit, the characters will gripe about how tired they are and how they want to go to bed approximately every 5 seconds.  Or if you should ever deviate from the shortest path through a level, they will start spouting off about how you're going the wrong way.  This will drive you insane in a hurry.  I can't believe EA thought this was a good idea.  At the least you should have an option to turn the voices off.The mini-games in this game are dull to say the least.  As I said before, there is no Quidditch, in fact you don't touch a broomstick in the game.  Yes, you do get to fly Buckbeak aimlessly around the castle grounds if you desire, but this is a very poor substitute.  The other mini-games are pointless and boring, and one of them, Owl Racing, was apparently deisgned as torture for your fingers, since you have to tap a button over and over again in a precise rhythm for several minutes in order to make your owl flap her wings and fly.  I did it one time and never again, since I don't particularly enjoy finger cramping.Graphically and sound-wise the game is also below par.  Most of the characters look and sound nothing like their movie counterparts.  The worst is Professor Snape.  I don't know who did his voice acting, but they could have gotten the guy who does Spongebob Squarepants and it would have sounded better.  Of course, you don't hear much of his voice anyway, since every time you encounter him outside of Potions class in the game, he will look at you and immediately go into a fit of coughing and hacking - bascially Snape has a year-long bout of emphysema in this game.  What is up with that?You spend far too much time in this game staring at loading screens.  Every time you open a door, even to enter the tiniest room - loading screens.  Running from outside the front door of Hogwarts to Gryffindor tower takes about 2 minutes of play time and about 90 seconds of staring at a loading screen.  This is far too much, and EA really needs to fix this recurring problem in their Potter games.  Other simiar games don't have this problem, why should this one?  It certainly isn't the great graphics.Outdoors is another disappointment.  Yes, you can fly Buckbeak over a complete version of Hogwarts, but, except for the relocated front door, it is the exact same building and grounds layout as in the last game.  In addition, in the last game, the grounds were inhabited by lots of students running around the castle, which did a lot for the immersion factor of the game.  Here, there is no one outside at all.  It's almost enough to make you feel lonely, running over the huge grounds all alone.  Also, in previous games, exploring the grounds and castle had a purpose - there were secret items all over the place waiting to be found.  Here, there is nothing beyond one or two chests with Wizard cards.  Outdoor exploration was one of the best things about Chamber of Secrets, but in this game it is yet another disappointment.Overall, this game let me down severely.  It's like EA decided that, since the Harry Potter games were intended for younger players and Chamber of Secrets might have been too difficult for them, they decided to make Prisoner of Azkaban much easier and get rid of all the fun and challenge and, in the process, most of the "Hogwarts" atmosphere.  (Although, young kids will probably have a lot of trouble with the Patronus spell).  Unless you just have to play every game with the Potter name on it, avoid this one.  Play Chamber of Secrets instead.  Let's hope that Goblet of Fire is better.

Jak & Daxter:  the Precursor Legacy was the first title in this series, and it very much set the standard on the Playstation for the Platformer genre.  I have played and beaten the prequel thoroughly, even getting the extra ending for finding all the Precursor Orbs. I loved the game from one end to the other.When Jak 2 opens, it's clear that the story will be taking a new turn into a dark place:  our heroes are in a bad future, and we take control of Jak only after an interval (told through cutscenes) of his having been tortured and mutated.  It seemed to make for an interesting new take on the series, but very quickly you realize that unlike its predecessor, Jak II imitates more than it innovates.  Even worse, the imitation isn't even in the same genre:  Jak 2 dovetails its platformer formula into a more "sandboxed" open world that heavily mimics the Grand Theft Auto series.  I've played the GTA series and loved it, but here the fusion fails miserably.  As the storyline progresses, frustrating side quests and attempts to inject variety into the gameplay are quickly derailed by the fact that a single mistake blows the entire operation, bumping into someone during a race can trigger a full alert, and you can easily get shot out of the sky, have your vehicle explode out from under you, or find yourself surrounded by a never-ending stream of guards.I'd like to say the awfulness ends there, but unfortunately the amount of effort quickly outweighs the payoff.  There are times when "puzzles" amount to "how often can you kill/smash things before you're caught and killed?"  In more than one sequence, you become convinced that Jack Thompson has finally found his "murder simulator":  the goal is to bang on the trigger, again and again, as fast as you can, while guards die screaming at your feet.  The difficulty is balanced by a bonus "Dark Jak" feature that makes you super-powerful. However this feature gets seriously annoying: it takes a lot of dark eco collecting to charge it up, and during these murder-fest stretches, it's all too easy to accidentally bang the lower trigger and blow your charge.  If you plan to use this power burst to get yourself through a difficult spot, if you don't survive to the checkpoint, you won't have it available to you again because there won't be enough Dark Eco lying around to recharge you.Where I finally gave up on this game--at the 94% mark--was when the number of pointless conveyor belts with hard-to-reach switches over boiling lava and/or radiation pits made me realize that this was no longer "challenging", it was more like a test to see how angry the player could get before they take the disc out and throw it against the wall.  I have beaten many a game and put up with many, many death sequences, and in the end Jak killed my desire to go on far deader than any of the bodies I'd stacked along the way.  Not clever, not fun for long, and not recommended.

I have beaten many a game and put up with many, many death sequences, and in the end Jak killed my desire to go on far deader than any of the bodies I'd stacked along the way.  Not clever, not fun for long, and not recommended.
The area isn't exactly the fantacy world Jak and Daxter 1 was set in, that is one of my all time favorite games, everywhere he went it looked plesant, but this game is mostl building reuins, geto, and swamp. You have to check back in to the same location after each mission, and it's hard to find since everything looks the same, and when think you are about to find it you run into the sombody and a large attack begains; by the time you escape you have totaly lost your way again. Jak does have a cool hover board he can flip out at any time, and a laser rifel he can use to shoot the bad guys. I do like the hover vechiles that Jak can "jak" anytime they fly over head

Jak II is suposed to be cool but it isnt. Its a babyish game that was supposed to be cool. I have no idea why its reated T. It should be E or lower. It is almost the exact same thing as Jak and Daxter. Dont buy it even if you liked Jak and Daxter.

The novelty of this game wears off very quickly. At first it was fun to play as several of the Simpsons characters but when they started repeating their dialogue for the 50th time it became mighty tedious and tiresome.The gameplay is very simple. If GTA: Vice City is the Lego Technic of road rage games then Simpsons: Road Rage is, without a doubt the Lego Duplo. It is SOOO aimed at kids. No one over the age of 13 will be particularly impressed with this. It's just far to `safe'. The Simpsons TV show is full of satirical humor and intelligence but this game is just a cheap spin-off aimed at a much younger audience.

SimCity 3k has great graphics hands-down, but if you've played oyther SimCitys then you've played SimCity 3k. The gameplay is identical with minor tweaks here and there, but with most of the hype that went into this game left out. You can't tweak individual buildings, or really get into the management of a city as you would like to. Once again things like subways and buses operate without an revenue generation (what country in the world gives away public transportation?), thus tying your economic fate to basically taxes (which are a simple model as well) and some policies. Graphics are great, but the gameplay is the same as before.

Don't buy Thunder.  It's not a bad game, just that you can better spend your money on NASCAR HEAT: Dirt to Daytona.  Thunder only offers stock car racing whereas Heat offers *4* games in 1: Dirt/Go-Kart(modifieds)/Truck/Car and therefore Heat offers a lot more variety and fun.  Buy NASCAR HEAT: Dirt to Daytona instead.

Please listen to me and realize that this was a very dissapointing game.  What went wrong I don't know.  EA &quot;Challenged&quot; their reputation making this game, cause it freaking sucks.Pros:- Graphics (Everything is more lifelike and seems almost that you can zoom in further than the other SimCity/s)- Terrain Builder (You can build mountains, hills, or make valleys and lakes)- Airport (This airport actually brings in people to your city and is no longer a zone.  It is pre-made)Cons:- Difficulty (Certainly not for the younger crowd)- Budget (I'm having a lot of trouble keeping money... no matter what- I have like three toxic waste dumps and a naval base missile tester and still my monthly income is negative.  I've raised my taxes and lowered matinence and buses and everything- nothing works.  MAJOR FLAW!)- Zoning (The zoning puts in streets that don't line up with other streets and if you delete you wast money because it's part of the zone.)- Overrated (look at the front of this game.  Never will you see buildings like that- trust me.  I never see blimps or helicopters.)Overall- 2/10 (I like the terrain builder a lot... but that's the only thing better than SimCity3000).Final Word- I was terribly dissapointed with this game.  SimCity3000 is just so much better.  Get it, and save some $.Have Fun w/ SimCity300, cause you WILL not have much fun with this.

El juego no es malo, pero me siento TOTALMENTE decepcionado. Soy comprador de FIFA desde el 2007 y esta entrega se la vendi a un amigo porque me parecio una falta de respeto TOTAL a los usuarios del juego.Como primera medida, las diferencias entre el FIFA 2011 y el 2012 a nivel de juevo NO SON tantas como anuncian, salvo detalles, el resto es mas marketing que otra cosa.Por otro lado y el PEOR punto del juego es Ultimate Team.En la version anterior usaba Ultimate Team TODOS los d&iacute;as, jugaba online TODOS los dias y hasta en el trabajo estaba detras de que item habia vendido o cual habia ganado... asi que era una adiccion total... hasta que salio el Fifa 2012. Cambiaron el dise&ntilde;o de la web a uno que a mi como dise&ntilde;ador no me lleva mas de 5 hrs de trabajo, minimizaron el tama&ntilde;o de las cartas, la resolucion en la calidad de las imagenes de los jugadores y lo que es peor: LA INDUMENTARIA ES MAS CHICA Y DIBUJADA! Ahora ya no se le ven los detalles como antes, de logos, costuras, publicidades, detalles de cada indumentaria en si...Es por todo esto que yo NO RECOMIENDO en lo mas minimo la compra de Fifa 2012 y espero que la version 2013 la mejoren porque sino me pasar&eacute; directamene a otra entrega como PES.Exitos.
el juego fue parte del combo para la PS3 80GB, asi que uno siempre le busca el lado positivo.pero un juego que se jacta de soportar hasta 12 jugadores, como es posible que no sea capaz de simplemente dejar que dos controles se conecten y puedan jugar.uno se pregunta si los dise&ntilde;adores son inexpertos o simplemente no les importa ofrecer un buen producto para obligarlo a comprar otro.  verdaderamente una decepcion.en si el juego es bueno sino fuera por lo anterior y definitivamente no vale la pena comprarlo.
Compr&eacute; este juego basado en comentarios y en un poco de nostalgia por otros juegos de boxeo, sin embargo, esperaba m&aacute;s'. ahora lo tengo guardado esperando que alguien me lo pida prestado pra no verlo mas...
Este juego es solo para ser jugado en red, tremenda limitante!!! Tomen esto en consideraci&oacute;n cuando decidan comprar este juego.
el material; deja bastante q descear no luce muy bien y la calidad es bastante pobre para ser un articulo oficial de sony y psvita
i recived this in the mail it was the case and booklet but LEFT FOR DEAD UNO i was furious
Wasn't horrible while it lasted. except for some serious balance issues and lack of content.  However this game was canceled.  You cant play it anymore the most you will ever get to do is watch the intro so unless you need the box for your collection. I would not buy this and I can't believe they are still allowed to sell this.  Want a good spaced based MMO  go with EVE Online.  It doesn't have much in the way of PVE content, but the PVP contents is expansive and beyond any MMO I have played.  With a complete Player based economy and only a small portion of space patroled by npc's. (There are 5000 solar systems to set up shop in so even the npc petroled areas are pretty big) you don't have to be a pirate, but the danger sure makes being a trader more interesting. you really don't like danger. then you can still run missions, trade goods, and mine ore in high security space, but its not nearly as valuable.

If your a stratagy lover and have patience of steel perhaps you will like this game. It has alot of history to it if your looking for a social studies lessen and decent graphics, but other than that...well...thats about it for this game, theres not to much more i can say about it.

In my opinion, Sly Cooper is the best platform next to Mario but don't get too excited because it's still a platform.  Sly Cooper looks great and makes good use of the cel shaded graphics.  That's probably the best part of the game.  The game can be more looked at as a platform on a rail or a combination of 2D and 3D.  If you have played Crash Bandicoot, you get the idea.  In fact, Sly Cooper probably uses an upgraded version of the crash Bandicoot engine.  The gameplay has a lot of new additions but for anyone who has played Crash Bandicoot the gameplay will seem very familiar at some points.The game has five different worlds, each is introduced as an entirely 3D environment, but that's just deceiving. Your real goal is to find the doors in which you will enter a mission and be forced to complete a linear 2D/3D railed obstacle course.  It's a little more creative than Crash Bandicoot where you literally where in a portal room and each of the missions had a door with a label on it.  The Objective of each world is to gather all the keys that lay in that world.  You collect the keys by passing the linear obstacle courses obviously.  Once you have collected all the keys of that world, you can now use them to gain access to the boss of that world.  Then you beat the boss and move on the next world.  Think Crash Bandicoot again, only you actually see yourself inside of a van, and you see your progress on a map in a cartoon like cut scene, this indicates your in the process of traveling to the new world.  In Crash Bandicoot, the portal room just moved up to a new floor with all new missions again.The game has awesome graphics, and very good dialog.  The cut scenes are literally cartoon quality.  At times, you will feel like your actually playing a cartoon.  The game has a story line, it's a rather weak one, but I thought it was surprisenly mature.  The story starts off by Sly Cooper giving you a history briefing about how his whole family was killed by some thugs the night his families jewel, &quot;The Thievious Raccoonus&quot; was stolen.  Since then, he's been on a mission to get it back.  I don't remember the last time anyone was killed in the story line of a Mario game.

In the long history of PC games there haven't been many James Bond-brand releases on the PC; in fact, I can't name any offhand (aside from maybe James Bond Jr.). The brand has had a fruitful experience for the consoles, including the famous release of Goldeneye for the Nintendo 64.With the release of a new Bond adventure in 2002 publisher Electronic Arts wanted to create a big cross-platform Bond action/shooter that didn't have to rely on the new movie but still carried the name and was released at about the same time. Unfortunately they decided to bet on relatively old technology and some strange creative choices to do it (at least on the PC version), and the result became a rather uninteresting game called Nightfire.The player assumes the role of dashing MI-6 agent James Bond, 007, here to free the world from nuclear tyranny, British ex-patriots, and so on. Each of the nine missions precedes a full-motion animated cut scene that uncovers more of the general plot and details the next mission. More average-quality cut scenes are interspersed throughout the game at various points.Nightfire is a first-person shooter and shares all the nuances of that breed of game, with the same familiar style of control schema, albeit with some trademark differences. Aside from the variety of guns available, Bond can switch to a gadget inventory and select from one of those - the gadgets are primarily one-event-type items. A wristwatch serves as a laser for cutting locks, for instance, though you couldn't even use it to get the attention of a guard.The other gadget worth noting is the sunglasses, which when put on can switch between different shades of the spectrum - handy for locating hidden areas, laser traps, or through women's dresses. The downside is that you can only use it for so long as it runs on (rechargeable) battery power, not to mention the sunglasses are buggy.As stated above, there are only nine missions -- each have a variety of submissions with their own set of objectives. While the level design is adequate it pretty much pushes the limits of the engine, including multiple loads in a single level. The objectives, which update as the mission progresses, is not very helpful at telling you what needs to be done or even why. Only by going through a level, killing everything, and checking and/or destroying everything else can you really figure some of them out - unless of course it happens to be a level where there is a never-ending stream of bad guys and there is no clue as to what to do.Another problem of note is that a player can effectively win a mission by accomplishing an objective, get killed because of something else, and still lose the mission as the mission results screen is delayed while the game still runs. I actually ran into this on a particularly annoying boss level.Mere mention of the console game-style boss creatures is another bad mark. This by itself is not too annoying, but the bosses, not to mention the situations you're thrust into, are painfully stupid. Speaking of painfully stupid, that would be the perfect description of the game's artificial intelligence (AI) - enough said on that.This is not to say that Nightfire has some redeeming qualities. Some of the levels require going into third-person mode, which is a fun switch. Bond can only carry around four big weapons at a time, so you will have to strategize in some situations. You can use multiple different methods in certain missions to accomplish the objective. On the very first mission, Bond can sneak his way into the castle complex through the back way or fight his way through.Nightfire includes a multiplayer mode as well. It consists of LAN or internet play, supporting up to 32 players, with three modes of play: combat training (deathmatch), team combat training (team deathmatch), and capture the flag. In team games one team assumes the role of the good guys while the other team is the bad guys - and they have different models to match. Unfortunately, multiplayer mode seems tacked on and a few of the levels are very unbalanced.Several times already I've described the Nightfire engine as being stretched to the limit. That's because the developer, Gearbox Interactive, went with the Half-Life engine to develop the game, and added in their own in-house goodies. Gearbox is no stranger to using the Half-Life engine, but to release a major title with a four year-old engine (at launch) is troublesome at best.Character models are average if not great, and the animations are about the same - though there are some specialized animations as well. The Australian secret agent is a blond Lara Croft rip-off.I'm a bit of a Bond movie traditionalist so it's hurtful to sit through a particularly hard level of Nightfire listening to some techno/new age version of a rehashed Bond theme over and over again. Oh, there is some variety, and a small bit of it is catchy, but enough is enough. The song featured in the intro sequence by the female singer Esthero (and plays in the background on the menu screens) is quite good, however. The voice acting for the various characters, including Bond, seems very uneven.James Bond 007: Nightfire is a lackluster game stuck in an old engine that probably should have gone through a bit more in the design and implementation stage. Aside from a nice opening sequence and a few "well that's kind of cool" moments in-game Nightfire should definitely have its license revoked.

That's because the developer, Gearbox Interactive, went with the Half-Life engine to develop the game, and added in their own in-house goodies. Gearbox is no stranger to using the Half-Life engine, but to release a major title with a four year-old engine (at launch) is troublesome at best.Character models are average if not great, and the animations are about the same - though there are some specialized animations as well. The Australian secret agent is a blond Lara Croft rip-off.I'm a bit of a Bond movie traditionalist so it's hurtful to sit through a particularly hard level of Nightfire listening to some techno/new age version of a rehashed Bond theme over and over again. Oh, there is some variety, and a small bit of it is catchy, but enough is enough. The song featured in the intro sequence by the female singer Esthero (and plays in the background on the menu screens) is quite good, however. The voice acting for the various characters, including Bond, seems very uneven.James Bond 007: Nightfire is a lackluster game stuck in an old engine that probably should have gone through a bit more in the design and implementation stage. Aside from a nice opening sequence and a few "well that's kind of cool" moments in-game Nightfire should definitely have its license revoked.
Ty the Tasmanian Tiger, Jack and Daxter, Chrash Bandicoot, Spyro the Dragon, Ratchet and Clank, Zapper the Cricket, Frogger (the recent ones), and the list goes on. They are all the same! Sure there may be a few differences in style and gameplay, but its all the same thing, find the items, save something, collect coins, jewlels, or whatever, and use the same basic jump and attack on a bunch of the same enemies walkin around. Ty is simply the new addition to this little family, and quite frankly, it has gotten very old. The minor inovations aren't near enough to put this one up and away from the rest. But if clich&eacute; adventure games are your thing, then  have a blast. But for the rest of us, something new please.

I love the Sly Cooper Series, but I must say, this is my least favorite. The graphics are poor and getting keys get boring after a while. The most fun part is the driving games with the Cooper Getaway Van. Can't wait for Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time!

There's a reason the price of this game has dropped so quickly compared to it's console counterparts - it's a horribly sub-par conversion of what might otherwise have been a pretty decent Bond game.Nightfire is a mixture of the most infamous elements of the James Bond movies. Bond must stop a mad industrialist from nuking the world, and has several gadgets and female friends to help him accomplish this. EA takes advantage of the Bond licence, as the game features Pierce Brosnan's face as Bond, the familiar Bond theme, appearances by classic Bond villains, and other goodies.But Nightfire lacks in several areas. First, the cool driving levels found in the console versions have been dropped from the PC version, probably due to lack of space. This leaves only 9 levels, which is just too short of a Bond experience. The game also seems to require a pretty high-end system to run.I have no problems running other recent games, such as Jedi Outcast, but Nightfire still stuttered along even when I set all the graphics options to low detail (and the graphics in Nightfire don't seem that spectacular in the first place). While I said EA takes advantage of the Bond licence, this isn't always a good thing. The Bond theme appears too often and quickly gets annoying, while the voice actor for Bond overplays his part and turns Bond into the stereotypical, cliched secret agent. Actual gameplay isn't too bad, but nothing special either. The levels are mostly non-interactive, small, and take too long to load (especially the Japanese resort level, where the game has to pause and load every few rooms, completely breaking up the gameplay). Finally, the game actually copies all of its cutscenes as AVI files onto your computer during installation. What's the point of playing the game when we can just watch the cutscenes, EA? Someone should have thought this out, and encoded the cutscenes as an unlockable extra, not give players free access to them even before they've seen the first level.If you have a PS2, Gamecube, or X-Box, get Nightfire for one of those instead, and not this inferior PC port. If you don't, I can't really recommend Nightfire even to the most die-hard James Bond fans.

Graphics. Amazing. Gameplay. Amazing. The seemless evolution from Sims 1 to Sims 2 features. Amazing. Seriouly, this is a well thoughtout game, is its design and innovation. However Ill tell you what's not amazing... The fact that I can't get the freaking thing to play on my machine. I have a 2.8 P4 with a Nvidia 128 card, and 1G ram. So you can understand how I felt more than confident my machine could handle it. Um, well, you see, the game, it simply locks up. Alot. Maybe about every 5 minutes it will freeze for no aparent reason, even my angry furys of ALT-Tab, ALT-Tab, ALT-Tab, could not save me from the frozen pixelated suburban nightmare on my screen. I spent the good part of the evening trying EVERYTHING to get this sucker to work. From using the absolute lowest resolution, to turning off all background processes, to even applying a no cd crack. Nada. Nothing. Zilch. No results. So my advice to you is to keep on checking back to the Maxis website for an official patch to fix these issues. Otherwise, buy at your own risk.

I bought this when it was first released for the PS2.  I had high expectations due to its predecessor, Medal of Honor Frontline.  This game was a huge disappointment to say the least.  You start out sleeping in a bunk below deck on a naval ship in Pearl Harbor.  The Japanese attack, and you need to get to the top of the ship and fight them off while you escape.  So, the beginning of this game is not too bad, and I was mildly interested in the gameplay.  Then things went downhill.  I can sum it up with one sentence:  Before I knew what was happening, I was done with the game.  Yes, that is right:  this game is so short it is not even worth the $ price tag.  I beat it in about 7 hours, and that includes taking bathroom breaks and eating meals.Summary (out of 10)Graphics: 5Controls: 5Story:  3Gameplay: 2Overall:  3If you want a good military shooter, try Return to Castle Wolfenstein or Medal of Honor Frontline.  Medal of Honor Rising Sun is not worth the time it takes to get the shrinkwrap off.

This is the worst bond game ever, and possibly the worst game ever. It is not a game, it's a movie. here are the reasons it sucks:1)EA went with the trend and went 3rd person. This disallows for any entertaining gameplay at all, because you cannot sidestep.2)The co-operative multiplayer is a completely different story than the single player, and all of the characters you start with are generic ppl.3)The Co-operative mode is unbelievably hard. It is like trying to shove a rhino in a soda can. It is not entertaining, and is the most frustrating thing i've ever played.4)You must beat the first "level", which consists of about 10 cansecutive levels, of co-operative to unlock arena mode.5)I have repeatedly completed every goal to get a platinum medal on one mission, but the game refuses to award it to me.6)The only good things about this game are the driving levels, but they soon become repetitive and boring.7)Pierce Brosnan's scrip is worse than that of Dyanasty Warriors 3. After having a discussion with Q about metal, Q suggests he leave. Bond says "Platinum idea, Q, lets test Diavolo's mettle."The line "Bond, James Bond" is repeated at least 4 times, and it is not dilivered well.8)I know it's a little sexist, but the girls are ugly as hell.9)The game is basically a remixed, retextured Enter the Matrix, only with worse hand-to-hand combat, and no focus ability.10)The only reasons to play this game are to see John Cleese as Q, and Willem Dafoe as Diavolo (2 letters away from the spanish word for devil)

Yet another in the turgid 'Wing Commander' series, 'Prophecy'thankfully reduces the amount of dull, plotless FMV, whilst notsignificantly improving the gameplay, which doesn't seem to have evolved very much since the original 'Wing Commander'. Your ship still doesn't 'feel' as if it is flying through space, the supposedly-invincible bad guys are more of a nuisance than a threat, and if you fail a mission it will probably be because you failed to protect something that you were not told about.Imagine watching a bad, low-budget science fiction film whilst playing a modern homage to 'Star Raiders' and you have the game in a nutshell.

Having survived the terrible experience of Mass Effect 3's horrible ending - which, BTW, has been improved from horrible to underwhelming with the Extended Cut DLC - I decided to play ME1 again just to immerse in the fantastic Mass Effect phenomenon at least once more. Moreover, I want to prove to myself that ME3's ending, as disappointing as it is, cannot mar the eternal beauty of ME1 (and to a lesser effect, also ME2) - And I am happy to report that I was not disappointed.To begin with, it is crucial to establish that ME1 is unique in the series because it is a RPG with shooter element, whereas ME2 and ME3 are shooters with RPG elements. The most important and simple distinction is this: In ME1, regardless of how well your aiming skill is, your weapons' accuracy is, by and large, dependent on the XP you invested in a particular weapon. On the other hand, in ME2 and 3, your aiming skill (along with reaction speed) determines your accuracy. In this regard, to me, ME1 is the best in the series as a RPG; with ME3 being the best as a shooter(in spite of its disappointing ending; and ME2 somewhere in between (for the overall games in disregard of the genres, I'd rate ME1 being the best game overall, followed by ME2, then ME3).Also, ME1 leans heavily toward exploration. Granted, this is the least developed aspects of the game, especially in regard to driving around the planets in the M35 Mako infantry assault vehicle or running around the Citadel doing side quests, which can be uneventful for the most part - if not downright boring. On the other hand, running or driving around afford you some spectacular views such as the Earth rise from the moon or awe-inspiring vista from the Citadel docking bay.In addition to the reasons above, the primary reason that ME1 is special to me is its story elements. As a former fan of the 80s science fiction mini-series like Battlestar Galactica (the one and the only original one, of course) or Buck Roger, I have to say that ME1 captured the atmosphere and the mood of these mini-series perfectly - and even better in many cases. As is, obviously having drawn many experiences from their excellent previous work in the Knight of the Old Republic, the EAbioware writing team, headed by Drew Kapyshyn, did a stellar job in creating their own science fiction universe and its own saga.The music in ME1, composed by Jack Wall and Sam Hulick, may not be perfect - but it is a perfect fit for the game. Surely, it is not as melodramatic as the music in ME3; nor is it as inspiring as ME2's. However, when framed within of the aforementioned science fiction genre, it is simply perfect. As is, I also have the soundtrack of ME1 and highly recommend it fellow ME fans.Another remarkable achievement for ME1 - at least for me - is that up until ME1, I never really give a damn about voice acting in games. In fact, I strongly dislike the idea of merging video games and movies together - and I still do. However, ME1 is an exception due the outstanding performances by virtually all the actors involved - especially Jennifer Hale, who voiced the female Commander Sheppard.In conclusion, and also in retrospection, in spite of all the little things that ME1 did not get right, in addition to the overreaching but worthless limited activation DRM scheme that wrecked the overall product (a serious offense in my book which results in an unfortunate deduction of 2 stars for the product), the game itself is beautifully executed and its story is a substantial work of well-implemented science fiction. Therefore, whether you are newcomer to the ME series or a veteran - and if you think the DRM scheme is worth the trouble - taking into considering the game's dirt cheap current pricing (also, please see the comment section for more info) - it's worth it to embrace the eternity of Mass Effect 1.
I own all the Mass Effect games, and proudly bought them as they came out, and keep up to date on DLC.  So why am I reviewing a set I have no reason to own?  Because I know a rip off when I see one!  And if the Mass Effect trilogy was going to have a boxset it needed to be DEFINITIVE!NONE of the franchise's large collection of DLC is included in this pack.Sure, DLC in the first Mass Effect isn't anything special, but for Mass Effect 2 there's bonus levels which directly bridge the gap between it and Mass Effect 3!When games like Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion released new editions they included all the DLC expansion packs on bonus discs (if you played on Xbox360).  At this point I expect that when a big RPG like this are re-released they will include all the DLC as a bonus.Here's the real kicker.  Say you just want the basic Mass Effect experience without the DLC.  This set still won't meet your needs because you can buy all three of these games individually for less than $60.  Heck, get the Platinum Edition of the first game and you'll at least get one of the DLC missions!So this set fails on two counts:1) If you're a new gamer wanting to tackle the Mass Effect trilogy for the first time your wallet would be better off buying the games individually.2) If you're someone who wanted the definitive Mass Effect experience this set fails to include anything worth warranting a double dip.So either buy the games individually, hold off until this set is in the $40 range, or wait for BioWare to release the inevitable "Definitive/Collector's/whatever" special edition with all the DLC included.
The game play up to the last part of ME3 was great, but the end of the game ruined the entire series and the franchise. The parts that ruined the game for me are listed below.1.1. The endings for the game were horrible 3 choices that led to 6 variations of the same black. No variety like promised, all the endings shared 95% the same cut scenes. We were promised throughout the series that all our choices would shape not only our Sheppard but the galaxy and the final ending to the series; this was taken away in the final 15 minutes of the game. You can't just take an interactive game built on choice and make it into a linear game in the final moments.1.2. Multi player content should have no effect on the single player campaign. There is a reason why no other game has implemented this, since not everyone like multi player. A player should be able to reach 100% galactic readiness without having to play multi player.1.3. I did not like that after you make it clear to Cortez that you are not interested in him, that he still seems to push you towards liking him in future conversations. My personal beliefs I don't approve of the Homosexual lifestyle, and I don't feel I need to have that pushed on  my in a game.1.4. We want our endings more varied and distinct from each other like was promised, having all our choices taken into account in the final outcome.1.5. Fill the plot holes give us a real back round on the Reapers, and their purpose, bring Harbringer into the picture more.1.6. For those that ME3 is their first exposure to the ME universe, offer them a DLC that allows them to make the choices they would have had a chance to if they played ME1-ME2. This will make more revenue for Bioware in a DLC purchase, and give the player a chance to have a real full ME3 experience and a bump in galactic readiness to help with their ending.1.7. The Rachni were always represented in ME1/ME2 as being an important part of ME3, and in ME3 they played a very small part. We had to save them again, and all they did was help build the crucible. We should have seen some Rachni ships in our fleet and so on.1.8. We were also told in previous magazine interviews prior to release that Cerberus was going to be an enemy, and that we should make sure to destroy the collector base  in our ME2 saves, This was so the illusive man would not get a hold of Reaper tech. Well I destroyed the collector base and the Illusive man still got a hold of Reaper tech. How he got acquired Reaper tech needs to be explained.1.9. One of the pieces of feedback many of us asked for was the return of the Mako Tank and exploration missions. That feedback seems to have fallen on deaf ears since we have no Mako missions in ME3.1.10. We had Loyalty missions in ME2 and it would have been nice to have them with the new squad members of ME3, it added immersion into the relationships with the characters.1.11. A helmet toggle option similar to what we had in ME1 would be nice, especially with the custom sets of armor we got from pre-orders, and import saves.1.12. If you are going to have 6 variations on the ending fine. But You could cut that to 6 endings and make them so varied and different it would make a more complete experience, with a excellent, very good, good, neutral, bad, very bad ending. The key thing being that it takes our past choices and actions into account, not just war assets and galactic readiness.I know that if at least the endings are not redone I will no longer purchase products from Bioware, and the ending DLC should be free, since we already paid for a proper ending to the game we purchased. People make the argument that the game is Art and not subject to pressure to change.I make the argument that an Interactive game like the Mass Effect series, in which certain promises and descriptions and player game shaping was established by the company makes it a Commercial product , with art aspects, and a ever changing storyline, Due to the players participation in the creativeWhat should have happened is the squad with Sheppard barely makes it to the beam and teleports to the Citadel. Have the illusive man knock out everyone but Sheppard and Anderson with his new powers keep basically the whole dialogue between them, except make it easier for Sheppard to use a paragon or renegade option for the illusive man killing himself.After the illusive man's death, have Harbinger reanimate his body as an avatar of Harbinger, and have a interactive dialogue  between them leading to a final one on one battle between the two. At the end of the battle have Sheppard use the crucible in either a passive way that destroys the reapers, or as a massive thailix cannon to assist in killing the Reapers.Have our choices throughout the series determine what ending we have. Keep the ending diverse into for example 6 possibilities, including great, very good, good, neutral, bad,  very bad. If you want to make more money on DLC create a DLC that offers players new to the franchise to use an interactive comic like you did with ME2 and have them quickly make the choices they would have if they had played the entire series.The key thing here is we just want was promised in interviews and articles prior to release, nothing more. A proper set of endings to up till now a Epic game franchise worthy of being called the 21st century Star wars saga.
This is the first sign of decline for Bioware. It only gets worse from here. Don't buy a game that continuously recycles the same environments over and over. A game that promises that your decisions matter leads you to 1 of 2 decisions regardless of your choices. If you accept junk, EA and Bioware will keep selling you junk. Casey Hudson and Mac Waters have destroyed this company.
Saeth left a review that covers the enormous problems with the ending to this game, and I agree almost completely with everything he or she said.I further wanted to add that, while a lot of people are saying that Bioware should do a new ending, I don't think it will fix anything.  Personally, I would never believe a new ending.  Problem is, I don't believe the old ending, either.  My suspension of disbelief for the entire Mass Effect universe is shattered, in tiny shards on the floor.  All things my Shepard did, all the people he helped (or that my Renegade Femshep cheerfully screwed over)... none of those things mattered in the least, at the end.SPOILERS FOLLOW:If you're a prior player of this series, whatever you did in Mass Effect 1 and 2, no matter what course you charted, you will get the exact same ending I did.  Everyone you liked, everyone you hated, all the cultures, all the planets, everything?  They're all destroyed, wiped out in exploding Mass Relays (and we know from the DLC in ME2 just how cataclysmic a collapsing relay is, from a simple rock hitting it, nevermind the most powerful weapon ever designed by the Galaxy's second most advanced race).  Your sole choice is red, green, or blue fire to wipe them out with.That's it.  That's what all your choices amount to: nothing.  No matter how skilled you were, no matter how inept you were, no matter how carefully you guided your decision-making, no matter how sloppy and uncaring you were, the ultimate choice is the same: kill everyone and everything you know, with one of three festive colors.This must be the worst big-budget storytelling failure, like, *ever*.  The midpoints of the game are awesome, but the end is so appallingly terrible that it retroactively poisoned any happy memories I had of everything else I'd seen and done, all through the entire series.  Not even the Matrix was this bad, and I certainly didn't invest $160 and a hundred and fifty hours battling through the three Matrix movies.
**INCLUDES SPOILERS**When the original Mass Effect came out for the Xbox 360, I fell in love with it!Yes, the graphics were not "smooth" and the concept of shooter-RPG was new at the time. However, I fell in love with character developments. I loved the fact that most of the Non-Playable Characters (NPC's) that I talked to had a story; and they didn't just have a bland story, their stories were deep and very interesting. These stories would vary on your choices; so, naturally, I played the game three times...thats right, THREE times just to see how the game would change with different choices. I loved the original Mass Effect, and Mass Effect 2 was even better. Mass Effect 2 added even more depth to the story. I could care less about Shepard, it was all about the choices that I made in original Mass Effect that mattered more. I spent more time with Mass Effect 2 than any other game since 2006.I am not going to discuss the graphics, the sound, or even the "special edition stuff". I want to review about what Mass Effect series has been about (for me anyways): the story with character development.A good story is good from the beginning to the end. You develop your Mass Effect story with the original ME, continue with ME2, and then you have ME3...which is suppose to be the end of your story. In ME3, Earth and many other planets are under attack, and Shepard is given the task of  building alliances with other races to take down the reapers for good. As you travel the galaxy to build alliance, ME3 does a fantastic job of implementing your decisions made in ME/ME2 with that of ME3...and believe me, your decisions in ME/ME2 does have an impact in ME3!ME3 DID everything brilliantly, except the end. You created a story which lasts across three games, but the end is like...well, lets just say your story/choices/decisions simply didn't matter at all. You make "good" or "renegade" decisions, or build all those relationships with your teammates hoping for a respective closure, but you are treated with one generic ending.Personally, with a series like Mass Effect (deep story/character building), I would have been happy with a few sentences saying what happens 10-years after your big fight or what happens to your squad...but nope, nothing like that. There are three endings...actually, its just one ending with three different colors.I have spent countless hours with the original Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2...making different decisions, making sure I get the best rating, making sure everyone is happy. They were absolutely fantastic games!Can the same be said for Mass Effect 3? No. I dont think I will even play it again. You can tell that EA and Bioware rushed through the game (most of my ME2 characters were killed in ME3) so they can focus on DLC's. Keep your olive branches EA/Bioware, if I want to play ME3 DLC's, I may consider buying a used copy of Mass Effect 3 "Game of the Year Edition" when its $10 on Ebay.
One of the best games ever produced at one of the worst prices ever.  You can pick up Mass Effect 1 and 2 for less than 10 bucks used, and mass effect 3 for 15.  This comes with nothing extra and the DLC content isn't even included which is a complete joke.  Don't fall for this and let EA choke on their own greed.Was at a game stop last night and looked up the prices of the games.Mass Effect 1,  $7Mass Effect 2  $8New Mass Effect 3  $14Do the math and weep if you bought this.This doesn't include the promotion buy two get one free.
If you were to go into the game blind it would be a fine shooter with some nice T-n-A as well.  There is decent dialog mixed with some pretty clumsy dialog.  Great vistas and environments, difficult combat (insanity level is actually difficult in ME3 vs ME2 and ME1).  If you come in expecting this to be like Mass Effect 1 and 2, have been involved in the Mass Effect universe and have come to love the characters, aliens, worlds, idea, and have enjoyed the easy replay value of the first two in the series, you will be deeply disappointed.  After playing this game one time I cannot get up any desire to play it again.  Worse, it takes any desire to play the previous games away too.  I see no point to playing any DLC (downloadable content) with the current ending of Mass Effect 3.There is a very enjoyable multiplayer addition to this game - fun because it is not a situation where you rez into the game and immediately get snipered dead.  This is fast-paced team play in different environments and can get quite challenging.  The negative and then the bigger negative is that in the singleplayer game, there is a rating for "galactic readiness".  It starts and 50% and will stay there until and unless you successfully complete multiple waves of multiplayer game runs.  You will inch the readiness level up 4-5% with each successful mission completion.  So, in singleplayer in order to get galactic readiness increased you HAVE to play multiplayer whether you want to or not.  That's a negative.  Bigger negative is it makes no difference whatsoever in the ending!  You can get your "galactic readiness" up to 100%, complete every side mission successfully, gain every possible ally to the big fight against the Reapers, find EVERY last military resource in the galaxy and still, in the end, you die and so does most of the galaxy, and galactic civilization is rendered into tatters and impossible to maintain.  The ending is all stick, no carrot.  Why do anything in the game?  You cannot possibly do better than to die and see the entire galaxy wrecked.  Best case!  To add insult to injury, this totally eliminates any desire to replay Mass Effect 1 and 2 ever again!  To what end?  You may be going into Mass Effect 3 with one, two, four, any number of independent Shepard protagonist versions that you have developed from Mass Effect 1 to 2 but why run them through 3?  They ALL end the same way!  You see one ME 3 game you've seen them all.  You die, they all die.  The end.  Wow.  What fun.  The California Literature Review said it nicely, I think: "Bioware commits storytelling suicide."  Casey Hudson, head of Bioware, did say he wanted the end of Mass Effect 3 to be "memorable" and that it would end Commander Shepard's story.  It sure is memorable, but NOT in a good way, and it ends the Shepard story by murdering the entire franchise.Bioware blew it.  They promised (multiple times over the years) that the ending would be about as varied as the number of ways you can play through the games, plural.  Your decisions and actions in Mass Effect 1, 2, and 3 would all effect the ultimate outcome.  HAH!  Not at all.  You are dead, they are dead.  The end.  No appreciable difference at all.If you want a simple run-and-gun with pretty animated woman eye-candy in it, then buy this game and who cares about the ending. If you actually cared about the series, had fun with the series, got engrossed in the story, DON'T BUY IT.  At best, wait a week or two when this sucker hits the bargain bin and you don't have to toss $60 into the garbage bin for a game you will only have the heart to play once. By the way, I understand that Amazon will refund your money for this horrible end to the series.  I got mine directly from Origin/EA Games.  They wont refund but they will allow you to exchange Mass Effect 3 for ANY other game of equal value.  That's what I did.  I dumped Mass Effect 3.  I may buy it again if and when either Bioware fixes the ending OR the price for the game hits about $20.

Buyer beware - the product description does not describe some importantaspects of the game:This game requires an Internet activation, so if you have no Internetconnection you can't play.Also you are limited to 5 activations - so effectively you are not buying and owning a game, you are merely renting the game.This game secretly installs copy-protection software called SecuROM which can cause many problems for your computer, some of which are:1. When installing the game the user is not informed that SecuROM is being installed.2. SecuROM denies administrators full access to their PC, and blocks theadministrator from editing certain parts of the registry.3. SecuROM can interfere with the operation of hardware, specifically disc drives.4. SecuROM can interfere with the proper operation of software.5. When the game is uninstalled SecuROM is not uninstalled - it remainspermanently on your computer.6. The manner in which SecuROM runs on your computer is similar to that of malicious software called malware, and many people do indeed consider SecuROM to be malware.There have (at May 2009) been five class action lawsuits have been filedagainst Electronic Arts (EA) for their use of SecuROM.
This game is limited to 3 activations. An activation is used when you install or upgrade your computer. Once all the activations are used up, the game stops working!The DRM used by the game, SecuROM, is very invasive and harvests information about your computer and monitors / disrupts other legitimate applications that it deems may be used for piracy. This is an incredulous state of affairs and if piracy is a problem for the industry, the industry should prosecute the pirates and not invade the customers own computer with spyware to monitor them. It's way too draconian.
DRM with Activation limits has nothing at all to do with piracy. The game was already pirated days ago before it was released in the UK or America. They are using limited activations to prevent second hand sales and to limit the lifetime of the game. You will perpetually require an Activation Server to be running all the time if you want to install this game in a few years time. The DRM is also the beginnings of forcing games to become a RENTAL revenue model, as per the wishes of Electronic Arts own CEO, John Riccitiello, who wants us all to buy bare bones games in the future and pay for all the content as "extras".(see: [...]).SecuROM has already been prosecuted for using similar DRM technology in the music industry. The DRM that EA is using in Spore is unlawful.You can read the FTC ruling here: [...]

Avoid installing this on a computer. The software limits you to 3 installations before you have to re-purchase the game, and installing the game installs what is basically spyware/malware, SecuROM, which is known to damage computers, allow hacker access, prevent other games from properly working, disable your CD-ROM from working, and disable your anti-virus software.

The game has been just released. But I am not going to buy it. I used to a have a standing pre-order but not anymore, that has been long canceled. I gave EA a chance to mend its ways but it failed. Here is why.This is a warning Review. Warning of the dangers of the harbored Digital Rights Management (DRM) subroutine that comes unavoidably bundled with the game. This type of DRM (SecuROM 7x with Limited Installations) is well known as it has already been used in at least two other games (BIOSHOCK & MASS EFFECT). So my review is based on first-hand experience of a core aspect of the game.Apparently EA would rather keep its customers in the dark. That is why, in the past month, EA Forums got censored, Wikipedia entries selectively edited and Amazon reviews repeatedly deleted. What is worse, Amazon (possibly without knowing it) is breaking the law which requires the full disclosure of bundled snoop-ware.LIMITED INSTALLS? Yes, LIMITED INSTALLS!!! We only get to ride this shiny pony for...3 laps! The official announcement mentions "on 3 different computers" but avoids to clarify what a "different computer" makes: will changing the graphics card trigger the loss of a token? what about attaching a new hard-drive (internal or external) or adding a new user account. All the above have been reported to subtract installation tokens from BIOSHOCK or MASS EFFECT - and EA has intentionally left this area dark gray.Moreover, in order to enforce the limited installations, exactly like BIOSHOCK, there will be IRREMOVABLE FOLDERS placed in our systems' Root that will effectively revoke our Administrator rights to our own PCs! Short of reformatting, there is no deleting them even if logged in as Administrators.Is EA trying to pave the way towards a nightmarish future where PC gaming will be a continuously-billed service (such as direct-Pay TV) and not a product?Is EA trying to trigger a lemmings stampede towards the Pay-per-Play cliff, where gamers will be regarded as herded cows to be milked over months and years?Is the Company trying to turn our PC systems (that we bought and paid for) into their proprietary consoles, hence monstrosities such as SecuROM that offer zero anti-piracy protection?According to statements by their own spokespersons (such as John Riccitiello, CEO of EA) the answer to all of the above question is YES. However, I want to make clear that none of these statements had any impact on my rating of this game. The game has enough troubles as it is...Is it fair to rate badly a game based on its short duration or bad graphics? How about its instability and bugs? How about harboring potentially dangerous subroutines that will render it useless within a 12-16 months? You see how this is going?In the end, after all is said, with SPORE it boils down to this: who will actually be owning my copy? Are we to pay $50 only to...RENT this from its publisher, be potentially pestered with the insulting need to prove our purchase forever and place our hardware and data in danger?And what makes this even harder to understand: will such extreme measures actually prevent piracy? Of course NOT! They did not work for similarly DRM-plagued BIOSHOCK or MASS EFFECT, why should they start working now?So, one has to ask: what is next in store for customers that make the mistake of buying such a product? Will they be required to pay again to buy another copy of the game when the first one expires?Is THIS the solution that EA executives came up against piracy: since they cannot stop piracy, let's make all our paying customers PAY TWICE to make up for their million dollar bonuses?!NO THANKS! No game is worth such harassment!

I am forced to admit that GT5 gives you a lot for your money, but there were so many head-slappingly inane decisions made about the gameplay that I am forced to give this a hostile review:1.  The main thing I hated about this game was that there were no difficulty settings.  Basically you must take everything at full-bore difficulty, and woe to you if this is too hard.  But really, it's not that some of the tracks are hard so much as the WAY they were hard.  You're driving a car worth about 45,000 and they put you in races with supercars worth 20 million?  (Not just that, but there's no way you youself can possibly purchase such cars at this point.)  This is neither fun nor fair, but there's nothing you can do about it.  So you just start calculating to yourself, "If I were to come in first place in this race 215 times, I would have enough money to buy one of those Ferraris."2.  Another gripe I have is that in this game, supercars are not supercars.  Naturally after you've been playing for a little while you will shop around for a Ferrari or a Lamborghini.  Don't spend your money:  instead, go to the Internet, where you'll find discussion forums that will tell you that you can get a much better-performing car for a lot less, say the Nissan GT-R.  But this is a little ridiculous.  The game doesn't seem right when a 2009 fully-decked out Lamborghini is getting comprehensively out-performed by a garden-variety Nissan sedan!  Something seems wrong.3.  There are no Porsches to be had in this game, for licensing reasons, I assume.  This is probably not the programmers' fault, but still.4.  One can maximally have only 20 million in the bank.  This really blows since the cars that cost 20 million will cost you more than that, since it's virutally impossible to ding 20 million precisely:  any money earned over that will simply not be recorded.  But what really blows is that when you finally buy that Lamborghini Miura, you'll have to garage it until you can buy tires for it.  This really seemed wrong.5.  There exists a big gap between the Professional Series and the Extreme series.  Basically, if you'd like to continue into the Extreme Series, you're going to need a car that is worth several million dollars.  The problem is that nothing you can possibly do in the Professional Series is going to net you anywhere near that amount of money.  There is simply no way to transition smoothly from the Profeesional Series to the Extreme Series.  Hence the only solution is you've got to sit there for a couple of weeks running your B-spec drivers robotically around Daytona-style tracks until you have enough money to continue on with the next phase of the game.  So basically the game gets held up for a week or two while you get on to other things, such as your homework.  This was an asinine design decision.6.  The player is not able to control realism settings.  You've got no choice but to put up with weather, tire burn-out, car damage, etc.7.  The cars you win for finishing certain series can only be won once.  This doesn't make sense.  Can you imagine telling contestants in any sort of game that they can't win the prize because they've already won such a prize in the past?8.  The game plays with you by racing cars against you that are not readily available for purchase, such as the Yellowbird or the Chaparral.  I did not find this amusing.9.  There are not enough tracks!  This is because so many of the tracks are wasted on idiotic races (e.g., a tournament for the owners of a VW Lupo!?!?) that when you'd like to take one of your cars out for a race, there are only three or four choices to choose from?  You can only select the track of your choice if you're just practicing or if you're running cars that you don't own (i.e., GT mode).  But as for taking your beloved babies out on tracks you never get to see them on, forget it!  Those tracks are reserved for the pickup truck races!10.  One is not allowed to restart races in tournaments.11.  Having the cost of re-structuring the chassis be half of the car's value was totally unfair, as was the cost of an engine overhaul.  These prices are punitive, not realistic.  And what's the point of this anyways?  Next up:  having us pay for gas and insurance?  (Incidentally, I discovered that one's chassis breaks automatically without your even crashing the car.  Here's how:  1)  buy new car.  2)  enter race  3) immediately exit race before driving an inch.  You'll now have the option of restoring the chassis, implying that the car is damaged, since you're not permitted the option of paying for chassis repairs if the car is not damaged.)12.  Your car has to come in for pitstops for new tires and stuff:  other cars don't.  On the Extreme B-spec races, for example, it is only your car that has problems with tires balding out about lap 9:  the other cars never seem to.  Why is that?13.  The physics of the game don't make sense.  First of all, it's impossible to flip your car, no matter what you do.  There is no animation for it.  Neither do cars crash or show damage (though you have to pay for chassis damage).  But it goes deeper than that.  It seems like the physics of crashing and interacting with walls and other cars don't resemble reality.  For example, if you go off the track and hit a wall at, say, a 20 degree angle, your car will be smashed back to about a 160 degree angle, facing the wrong direction.  NEVER are you simply "righted" back to a zero degree angle.  It's almost as if the game is punishing you for crashing into walls, but in a way that doesn't make sense visually.  There's more, too.  There seems to be a sort of magnet effect going on sometimes.  Unlike my first example, this might actually be real physics:  I don't know, but it sure feels wrong.  What I mean is that when you run up on the rear end of the car in front of you, your car seems to "stick" and you can't detach yourself unless you completely slam on your brakes.  You can't simply scrape off to one side.  The same goes if your car is running along a wall, scraping along it at high speeds.  It seems like you ought to be able to steer away from it, detaching yourself.  But instead you're magically stuck to the wall somehow, and you can only veer away from it by greatly reducing your speed.14.  Further, the physics of collisions seem unfair.  Every time you collide with another car, yours is the one that is bumped off the road into the sand, never the enemy's.  It seems like this should happen about 50% of the time, but no.  It's virtually impossible to knock an opponent's car off the track:  if you do, it recovers immediately.  It seems like if there is a collision, it negatively affects only your car.  Why do you always get the short end of the stick?15.  The prices in this game are totally messed up!  You can buy a car for 2 million, deck it out with all the trimmings, and then, when you go to sell it, get about 200,000 for it, even though you haven't put a single mile on it!  This is not how reality works.  Realism-based, eh?16.  The game keeps making you go over to Google to find out what kinds of cars you're talking about.  When you're in the used store, for example, how'm I supposed to know that an SLS AMG is a kind of Mercedes? [This was fixed in a patch.]17.  As of the 2.02 update, the game has started to get more mercenary.  There will be cars displayed available for purchase, but you can't buy them unless you pay the company extra money for additional downloadable content through the PlayStation store.  A good example of this is the VW Golf '07.  Before the 2.02 patch, you could simply buy it from the new car dealership.  After December 2011, however, you had to pay more money (literal money, not game credits) to get that car.  Sheesh.  You figure if you lay out forty or fifty bucks for the game, they'd be done hustling you, but no.18.  There's a huge gap with the difficulty at higher levels of the game:  they don't scale well.  After you get the Formula Gran Turismo, for example, it feels like you entered the cheat code and the remainder of the game is uninteresting, if not tedious.19.  The manual sucks!  This game was released more than a year previous to this review, and by now you'd think people'd know how to play the game.  No.  For example, what causes chassis damage?  Is it aggressive driving?  Collisions?  Or simply miles?  Nobody seems to know.  Various websites have various theories, but nobody seems to agree about this basic thing.  But don't look to the manual to clarify that or anything else:  the most the extremely brief manual will tell you is "if you have an epileptic seizure, you should stop playing."20. The tracks are aseptic, almost lifeless.  If I see the Monza circuit one more time, I'm gonna barf!  I can't put my finger on why the Need for Speed tracks seem so various and invigorating while those of GT5 seem so jejune, but it's definitely a problem.21.  There's no way to upgrade your braking and steering.22.  This game features ads up the wazoo:  currently for Motul, Agip, Dunlop, and some others.  These names will change with time because these companies have paid to have their logos plastered all over the racetracks and there's no way you can avoid them.23.  There's no way to prevent the game from auto-saving.  This would have been useful in trying out a car you suspected was a crock. The Ferrari Enzo, for example, wasn't worth half the money you paid for it, but there was no way to test it out and then get your money back.24.  The "Seasonal Tracks" require you to race with crummy cars or cars with a strict horsepower limit.25.  Why can't I paint my cars any color I want as many times as I want?  I have like a billion dollars!  Instead I have to "earn" paint!?  It's ridiculous!26.  There's some sort of bug (or other fun-ruining mechanism) whereby, in B-spec, your drivers don't get full credit for all the experience they accumulate.  This seems to happen about level 30.  You can put them through a 24-hour endurance race, and they'll only move up one level, not the several levels the raw points they've been given should net them.  Then, those excess points disappear somehow and are never counted.27.  There is (alas!) a rather serious bug that's started to plague the game starting with the patch that came out in December of 2011.  When you are in the camera view that allows you to see the back of your car, the frame will jolt a bit every time you go around a turn to re-center itself.  This only starts happenening after you reach about 10 laps of the same track, but it means that endurance races will give you a headache.28.  Er, howzabout warning me, before I spend more than 10 million on certain cars such as the Ferrari F1s that they cannot be used in normal races?  And that you're not allowed to sell them once you've bought them?  (As you can tell by this review, I played this game day and night for quite a while, but this was the thing that finally soured me on it and inspired me to write this cranky review.  Go, little review! Fly! May you decrease Polyphony's sales and cause them to go under!)In sum, it's a little difficult for me to believe I have so many complaints about this game, but I do.  What's not showing, of course, is that I really got into it and played it for weeks.  Hence despite all these gripes I confess that it is well worth the money.  Here's a couple of things I liked about it:1.  The game really gets you interested in racing history and you start reading a lot more about that subject.  That's gotta be considered a plus for a game.  This kinda starts when you're like, "Wait.  Why would a '69 Ford be going for 20 million?"2.  Initially I thought B-spec was the stupidest thing I ever saw.  Why would I want to watch the PlayStation play itself?  That was only until I realized you can set B-spec going while you went off to classes or to sleep and when you came back you'd have a whole bunch of money.  I admit I actually quite got into this:  it was oddly satisfying, heading off to work or wherever, knowing that you were kinda playing even though you weren't there.  It was a great opportunity to get a lot of other, real-life work done during this time.
I've had this game for a week or so now and so far it's been decently fun, but few racing games are able to steer away from leading players into an utter hopeless feeling of frustration sometimes. Some days I put 8-10 hours of game play into it because in all truth, I'm competitive and I like racing games. Fun aside, the game is somewhat frustrating. First I would like to admit a few of my own personal flaws.1. I like racing games, but I'm not too keen to adjustment details (not seen in this game, this game is very simple). Adjustment details that can be found in much more advance, higher caliber, detail concentrated games like Forza.2. Because of number 1, I concentrate more on more simpler games. Thankfully there's NFS. My favorite NFS thus far is Most Wanted and the original older Hot Pursuit (PC). I like them because even though they're frustrating sometimes, the game is more easy going and you win more often. I know that's not the greatest reason, but I feel like the mixture of the two is more balanced in a positive way with those games.3. I'm also not a fantastic or very constantly good player. One game I'm GOD, the next I can't go 100 ft without hitting something.4. I have a bad temper, especially with frustrating games. My frustration is reasonable sometimes, even though I blame my lack of skills a bit more, but sometimes it just can't be helped.So I'll go to the point of way I think this game is lacking and frustrating:(Note that I play in career mode aka underground.1. I play this game and of course the graphics is not that great, it is a fairly old (2003~). Gaming has advanced significantly during that time. Anyhow, my point here is that the details are not adequate enough sometimes to let you see what's coming at you. When you race, you not only have to watch out for your rivals, but also what's in front of you and sometimes cars that not only go in your direction, but in the opposite direction as well. I can't really say that anyone is good enough to react fast enough to all occasions. Two examples would be going down hill where you momentarily go in slow motion through a third person often-side point of view and turning corners, whether sharp or not. I would race and the next thing I notice is a small bit of light and in a millisecond, crash. So during that moment, the details that I see, my head is trying to confirm whether it is a car or something else, maybe part of the scenary? The details are just not clear enough to tell you that to help you react fast enough, it's just very hard. The details in games that have you traveling at this speed with obstacles that are traveling at their speed towards you, should be spot on, clear, and crisp. This goes the same with a very similar other game called BURNOUT.2. Car position and spawning. We're talking about random cars used as obstacles. Sometimes they would stop while crossing the street for no reason, right in front of you. Sometimes, they would spawn near or in front of you. Sometimes they just appear down a steep hill which makes it almost impossible to maneuverer around because you don't even see them until you're practically over them.3. If you play this game, you'll probably notice that when you're near your rival racers, they tend to get into accidents a lot more. Sometimes, they would run into obvious objects to the point where it's just too obvious to be left unnoticed, where you start to understand that they're getting into accidents...not on accident, but on purpose. Like their main objective was to pretend to give you the feeling of a real race, where everyone can have accidents. However, off and away from your view, you'll start to notice that they almost always catch up and rarely get into accidents. If they get into accidents nearly as much as they do when you see them, how do they ever catch up? An obvious accident is running straight into another car even though the other car is still relatively far away.4. I don't understand the upgrade part of the game. They give you upgrades only for you to keep up with the other cars? It's like you never get an increased advantage over the other cars due to your newly/recently acquired upgrades. The other cars will always be as good if not better. The only reason you ever catch up is because of your reckless speed. I know the game is made to do this to give you a challenge, but it also demeans the thought of upgrading. Also take note that the other cars will match your upgrade, so if you don't upgrade, they don't either.5. New cars. I choose my car based on stats and until the 78/79th race where the Skyline is available/unlocked, all other cars have lower stats so what's the use in giving me new cars when my old car that I originally had the choice of choosing (Mazda), remains the best car in comparison? I keep unlocking new cars to drive, yet I don't see why I should even use them?6. Money. I play mostly on hard mode and, until recently started going into medium because it started becoming a game of frustration than recreation. Anyhow, money in this game feels worthless. I have something like 40k++ and I don't see myself ever using it all. I'm almost completely upgraded accept the last three...since when you buy an upgrade(s) for one car, all the other cars that are available will also have those upgrades available to them, I don't understand where the money is going into? I bought all the level paints, almost all the upgrades, full 5 star, and I have tons of money left. Hard mode gives you more money, but I don't see the use of it. I read in some guides that playing it almost completely in medium mode should give you enough money for everything. That's nice, but I don't really want EVERYTHING. I'm a completionist in training, but only when it counts. I'm not a hoarder of stuff that I don't even want. So if I'm not buying a ton of worthless stuff that I don't care for or don't even like, what's the money for? I could very well play the whole game in the lowest difficulty and still probably have enough money.7. There's really only a small handful of cars to use and in underground mode, there's a very, very small variety of maps to use. Mostly, they just make you go in reverse or open up an extra road here or there. You'll be racing in the same area over and over, that's a good and/or bad thing, depends on how you look at it.8. Why is this game even called Underground anyway? I don't see anything "underground" from it that is different from the others in the NFS franchise.OVERALL:This game is a little too much based on luck, especially with so little detail that you literally have to squint to make out the details of what's in front of you. Cars jumping out of nowhere, not getting into random accidents during a lap of racing...one lap is something, trying to cheat your luck on all 6 lap for example...that's just a little too much. The longest I've played a single race is an hour. I wanted to punch my monitor, but it's an LCD monitor and I don't have the money or time to replace it so...This game is so much based on luck, be prepared to click the restart button a few dozen times, especially on hard mode and even on medium mode.Is the game fun though? Yeah. My advice is:1. Keep racing till the end, sometimes for some weird reason, you might seem like you're losing for most of the race, but you might be able to win. Luck and reckless speeding is your bonus over the AI. However, if you're like 10-15:00 behind and you know you crash a lot, it's better to restart.2. Just turn the difficulty down if it becomes frustrating. It's a game, it's suppose to be fun and being frustrated, I'd rather just go to work or something...However, I do notice that sometimes the change in difficulty doesn't always make the race significantly easier for you....

There are plenty of odd and surreal stories. Indeed, some writers seem to find more fun in confusing the reader with mad and fantastical characters, than in actually attempting to tell a compelling story. This is usually a recipe for disaster, but never has it worked better than in the classic tale of the girl that fell down the rabbit hole. Alice in Wonderland has been recreated and reiterated on dozens of times, a testament to how good a world Lewis Carrol has created. One thing that rarely if ever changed though, was that Alice was always a children's tale, with humorous dialog and a happy ending. Madness Returns throws this idea out the window, in exchange for a twisted, macabre version of Wonderland. It's a novel approach, and one I was eager to enjoy, which is why I was so disappointed when I actually sat down and played the game. While it's not completely devoid of quality, it is far from the greatness of it's inspiration, and is not a journey I would not like to take again.StoryAs I said before, Alice Madness Returns is not a light hearted story. The game opens with Alice, having been recently released from an insane asylum, trying once again to put her mind back together. She lost her sanity, along with her family, in a fire when she was a child. All these years later, she's still having hallucinations, confusing fiction with reality, and falling back into wonderland. But the Wonderland she knew is gone. Corruption has spread to it's inhabitants, and a monstrous train is reeking havoc on her world. Alice has to know the truth, and thus sets out cleanse Wonderland, and discover what really happened in the fire that cost her so much.The story is definitely one of the few highlights of the game, and does a great job of pulling you into it's world. Alice won't be the only one not able to tell what's real from what isn't, as the game weaves in and out of Wonderland. There is no end to twists in the story, and when you finally get to the end, you'll no doubt be as shocked as I was about what happened. I should stress again that this is not a game for the squeamish or faint of heart, as the happenings can at times be truly horrifying. The dialog is the crown jewel of the presentation. It's witty and clever, and is very well written. The voice acting that goes along with it is equally impressive, and the game has some of the most unique characters I've seen in a game in ages. You might be wondering why I said I disliked the game so much. Well hold on, because there's a lot.GameplayThe gameplay is a mix of platforming and third person combat. Alice has all the usuals (jump, double jump, glide, and a shrinking ability) to get around with, but when your playing, it's immediately obvious that this isn't going to work. The controls are very floaty and imprecise, and you'll miss quick a few jumps because you for some reason jumped the opposite direction. This is made worse by platforms almost always being just close enough to make it, but far enough to miss it repeatedly. Platforming games have come a long way, but AMR feels extremely dated. You can't grab edges, the game rarely tells you what to do very well, and there are numerous cheap deaths to help pad out the game. I was fine with this at first, but as you go on it just gets worse and worse, and makes the final levels extremely frustrating to play. It just isn't challenging when it works, and it doesn't work when it's challenging.Combat is partially better, but becomes repetitive after only about halfway through. You get the Vorpal blade early on, and this will be your main weapon. It's a quick, light, melee attack that can kill almost every enemy in the game. You also get a machine gun like weapon, a grenade launcher, and a heavy melee (all fashioned to fit in the context of course). These can be used together, but as most enemies have a particular pattern to how they must be fought, there's little room for experimentation. That's not to say it isn't fun, but it does get extremely repetitive and monotonous. I hated walking into a room and having to defeat all the enemies to precede. I just wanted to get on with the story, but the game forced me to fight the same enemies over and over again. With no variation, encounters where always the same, making it feel like I was replaying the same section over, and over.PresentationPresentation wise, the game is both outstanding, and awful. The game has a very unique visual style, resting somewhere between realistic and cel-shaded. It fit's the world perfectly, and allows for both bright and colorful and dark and disturbing levels to exist in harmony, with neither looking at all out of place. The levels are all extremely imaginative and varied, with the standout being a floating castle made of cards. While they are amazing to behold, the levels drag on about twice as long as they should. Just when you think your through with an area, you'll begin a whole new section, doing much the same thing, in much the same way. Like everything else, it keeps you from advancing the story, and is repetitive to the extreme. The world is  populated with great character, all designed to fit in there respective level. They all fell entirely there own, and manage to dodge many of the stereotypes that inhabit so many games. You'll see many classics, like The Mad Hatter and Blue Caterpillar, re-imagined in the same twisted depravity as the rest of the game. Alice is particularly great, and you really start to care about what happens to her. She is also the most detailed, with little things like the way her hair and dress move making her look much more realistic. But the presentations isn't all perfect, with enough bugs and glitches to fill Hatter's endless apatite for tea. Frame rate slow down, clipping, broken animations, poor lip syncing, and a plethora of things I can't remember, the game falls into every technological pit it seemingly can. Non of these would be that bad on there own, but all together they really hurt the experience. It's been a good several years since release, and the fact that none of this is patched is a very bad signed indeed.VerdictI really wanted to love Madness Returns. I love the source material, I'm a huge fan of platformers, and the world looked incredibly unique (always a plus for me). But the game let me down so many times. The bad controls, repetitive levels and combat, and the never ending bugs all made me wish the game would just end and tell me what happens. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone but the most die hard Wonderland fans, that have a case for the macabre, and that can manage to deal with the glitches. Even then, I'd be hesitant, because actually playing the game is almost a chore. If you most know what happens, look up the cutscenes. This is one rabbit hole you shouldn't fall down.Final Opinion: 5/10 Bad
I've been a gamer now for about 18 years. I've played plenty of games on all types of platforms. I love my PSP as I can take my habit anywhere and get my fix. There have been many games put out for the PSP so far, some really good, and some horrible. Having finished Untold Legends - Brotherhood of The Blade, I was looking for another fun game, but something more current. On searching, I found two games, one of which was Resistance. I always thoroughly read all reviews to get a general feel for the game and what others think about it. I have to say, most got it wrong with this game.On receiving the game, I read through the manual. I was disappointed straight out of the box. The first thing I look for when searching for a game is if the controls are PSP friendly, and that means, that character movement is completely controlled by the analog stick. Most reviews said that is how the character is controlled in this game. Wrong. On reading the manual, I find that only forward and side to side character control is afforded by the analog stick, and to turn the character you have to use the triangle, circle, square, X pads in conjunction with the analog stick. This was exactly what I wanted to avoid because games that are not modified from the two analog stick control format of the PS2 and PS3 suck on the PSP because you don't have enough fingers to both control the character AND select weapons, AND aim, AND fire at the same time. Proper control on land should be totally by analog stick.I gave the game a run for its money. I'll be honest, the graphics and art work are excellent, and the story line is interesting. Sounds and music what little there is are very well done. But as one progresses through the levels it becomes increasingly difficult and then impossible to adequately control the character. This first becomes apparent when you try to swim the first time. You get an indicator to press down arrow to dive. OK, fine he goes under the water then what? You have to move the analog stick forward, but if you need to dive further, you have to press the down arrow again, hard to do when your using that hand to move forward. Turning is a joke as you attempt to use the Square and Circle buttons while pushing the analog stick. Down arrow will get you down under and diving, the up arrow button is all but useless as you die, lost and hopelessly disoriented as you've lost all sense of direction. Just to ice the cake they toss in a few Screachers later to attack you while you drown. Frustrating. The proper control set up for swimming should have been forward movement by analog stick and up, down, left, right by the symbol keys.As you progress you naturally encounter more and more enimies. Most of the earlier enimies are fairly easy, and ammo seems plentiful. Eventually you'll cross paths with an enimie called a Boiler. These lovely creatures look like the aliens you saw in the movie Independence Day. They have thick skin though so you have to shoot them forever to kill them. That uses up all or most of your ammo. The idea is, you shoot them in the head and their head explodes killing them. If you fail to do this, they explode their head of their own accord next to you taking away health. Problem, you cannot maneuver and aim and shoot at the same time because your both hands are having to control the character. You get used to shooting at the same time by pressing the R button, but unless you aim with these guys, be prepared to get blown up. Whoops, cannot aim, using that hand to do two other things, sorry. BOOM! This is a recurring major problem that only gets worse as you play along farther into the game. More enimies, less control, more of you dying instead of them. Half the time your out of ammo, even if you pick most or all of it up that you come across, which is pretty easy to do. Health is usually fairly plentiful, but there are some areas they could have cut you a break and laid one in a corner. There are some campaigns where you don't have any health options, you have to beat the gazillions of enimies overwhelming you or you die first. Again frustrating.Another poor design cue is with the weapons. There are plenty of weapons to use, and you get most of them in the beginning campaigns. Ammo is fairly plentiful, but because of control issues, you waste so much of it, you find yourself defenseless with useless empty weapons most of the time. A real problem is that each gun has different abilities, and dual capabilities. One for example is a regular gun in default mode, but acts as a grenade launcher in the other mode. The problem is, you have to aim the grenade and most of the time your needing to move while doing it. So that means your left hand is on the analog stick and your right hand is on the symbol keys, and they expect you to move, seek cover, and fire using your right button, but if you want to use the alternate weapon mode you have to press the left button, hold it then press the right button. So unless your a danged octopus, your not using the alternate weapons often. The other frustrating thing is, you eventually learn that for example the LAARK has some pretty good power. So you decide to select it, would you not think that a well designed game would display a tiny box or something with the gun name shown as your selecting weapons? Maybe the ability to press a button to refresh you memory as to what the selected weapon can do. Yes, you would expect that, but not in this game. Your on your own, all you get is a small icon, so unless you can recall in the heat of a battle while getting your butt blown off what the LAARK looked like, your SOL and DEAD.In the end this game was nothing but a lesson in total frustration. I did not enjoy playing it at all. Every turn was a struggle to control the character and stay alive only to die because the controls flat out suc'd. Designers of games like this where they are too lazy to change the control functions to PSP friendly should be put out of a job, there is no excuse for that type of poor planning and design. I can fully understand now why this game in spite of all of the glowing reviews was marked down to $14.99, still $14 too high in my opinion. Do not waste your time or hard earned money on this turd, buy God Of War first, now that is an incredible game.
I don't usually comment about other reviews but the other customer scores here are far, far too generous... which is to be expected on a much-hyped game's first day of release.  Resistance: Burning Skies is not "2 out of 10"-bad (reference there to Jim Sterling's panning of the game over at Destructoid), but it's certainly not what I would call a good way to spend $40.Here's where I'm coming from in terms of the Resistance series:  I bought R:Fall of Man way, way back when the PS3 first came out ($600 backwards-compatible PS3 unit, may you rest in peace after your untimely YLOD!) and had a pretty good time with it.  It was lengthy, the level design was sturdy enough, it was challenging, and Insomniac put in some decent reasons to come back to it.  It may not have the most sterling reputation 5+ years later, but it was polished and atmospheric for its time.  Resistance 2, well... I thought it was okay.  The graphics were a little rough and the game felt too sporadic in its movement from location to location, but it was fun in places.  Retribution on the PSP (by Sony Bend, the great studio behind the PSP Syphon Filter games and Uncharted GA for Vita) was a stunning revelation for the little handheld, matching great graphics with a strong story, an abundance of terrific secrets, and some very diverse gameplay.Finally, there's Resistance 3, which I consider to be not just one of the finest FPSs on the Playstation 3, but one of the finest FPSs to be released, period, since Half-Life 2 came out in 2004.  Insomniac hit their stride with fun multiplayer, a terrific campaign, and plenty of polish.I mention all of this because, well, imagine my disappointment now that I've spent the last six hours breezing through Resistance: Burning Skies by Nihilistic (their previous work, PlayStation Move Heroes, should have been my first clue).  Look, even if you come into this game telling yourself any twin-stick FPS on a handheld is an impressive feat, even if you set the bar impossibly low, even if you don't care about Resistance as a series, you are probably going to be disappointed by half of this $40 package.Let's start with the story:  There isn't really any.  All you know is that there have been rumblings about mutants in Europe and you're a fire fighter in New York.  It takes all of thirty seconds for the Chimera to pop up (in burning wreckage, no less), and so begins a mess in which you play a rather vague, nondescript firefighter (the only thing to remind you of this is your melee weapon, a fireman's axe) who for some reason keeps getting sidetracked on his way over to meet his family in a nearby refugee camp in New Jersey.  There's nothing really sprawling or epic about what happens; you move from bland city location to bland warehouse location to bland cyber lab and so on.  The voice acting is fine; the game's Alyx Vance-like companion, Ellie, is adequate; and the story even musters a genuinely nice moment very late in the game.  Unfortunately, 99% of the game is spent wandering narrow corridors with zero set pieces thrown in, so you quickly forget what your "character" is supposedly doing."Who cares about story in vidja games?!" you may retort.  Okay, well, let's move on to the nitty-gritty.  The graphics are a mixed bag.  Some of it (bosses, enemy textures up close, some ally expressions, tunnel sections) looks terrific, some of it looks awful (city street textures, enemy animations, graphical glitches galore).  The sound is perfunctory and at times grating (the chaingun, for instance, cuts out intermittently).  The music sounds good when it's present, which it hardly ever is (most of the game is played in relative silence).The absolute worst thing, though, is the level design.  Even by R1 standards--the standards of five years ago--this is bad level design.  Again, there are no interesting set pieces, only a few minor teases.  For example, you spend all of five minutes on a giant enemy's back only to spend an additional second or two killing him in the easiest way possible.  A water tower looks like it's about to fall on you... only to to be conveniently stopped by invisible walls.  A bridge is getting fire-bombed... but none of it ever collapses.  And so on.  It's all promise, no delivery.And this wouldn't be a half-bad homage to the simplistic FPSs of yesteryear (think Painkiller) if the game didn't scream "UNPOLISHED."  From the numerous graphical and sound glitches to the extremely short campaign and a final boss whose "patterns" and "strategy" border on nonsensical, it becomes evident that Nihilistic was probably planning much more than Sony would ever let them deliver given the Vita's strict launch timeline.  This game may have been pretty decent had it received an extra year in the can.What's worse, your interest in this game should begin and end with the single player game.  I know, I know, what about the multiplayer?  Well, here's the thing: Even if you end up enjoying the multiplayer in the game (and you just might, if you happen to get into a game), you're not going to be there for long.  Resistance 3 had what I would consider to be pretty darn good multiplayer and while Burning Skies is a step up from the cut-and-dry online deathmatch in Resistance: Retribution for PSP, it is so barebones as to be an ugly cousin to R3's multi suite.  And even then, R3's multi had you leveling so quickly, it didn't keep a community around for long.  In Burning Skies, you "level" that much faster and see everything there is to see, perks-wise, in the campaign.  Imagine, then, how few people are going to be playing this game in a month or so from now (and subtract 100,000 from your estimate, because you may have forgotten that the Vita hasn't sold too well in the US).In other words, you may be initially excited to play competent FPS multiplayer on the go, but after that wears off, you'll be reminded that everything is pared down for the sake of squeezing ultra-simple multiplayer into an otherwise rushed and incomplete game.Really, the best I can say for Resistance: Burning Skies is that a lot of it is merely adequate and it controls decently (if your thumbs can take extended rounds with the Vita's rather short analog sticks).  But I hope you don't really decide to spend $40 on "adequate" with a heaping side of "rushed to market."  Rent this or wait for the price to come down to $15-20.  Even then, you may be disappointed.  Personally, I'd return it, but I bought it at Best Buy (wah wah waaah).And if you're still really aching for a FPS to take advantage of the Vita, go back to playing the far superior Uncharted: GA and Unit 13.  Squint enough, and you might forget you're playing 3rd-person shooters.
I am in no way a person that typically has issues with Gran Turismo. I loved and watched and probably played at least some of Gran Turismo 1 and 2. I have owned Gran Turismo 3,4,5,6 and even the motorcycle Gran  Turismo gasme that was made for Playstation 2. The reason I own a Playstation 3 is so I could play Gran Turismo 5. If I ever do buy a Playstation 4 it will probably be to play Gran Turismo 7. So why a 2 star rating for Gran Turismo 6?...Fun... People who make video games have somehow in large part forgotten the reason why a video game should be made or exist. Fun, Fun, Fun,... this should be the motto hanging on the wall of any video game producer. Gran Turismo 6 has some fun, for sure, but it has way to much Frustration! I have no clue, why they thought every single race should start with all cars already in motion, and with the lead cars, plenty far out in the lead.They did a great thing with making the license test bronze times much easier to attain, for unlocking new races, but the one HUGE thing that has frustrated me to no end, is the GT World Championship Race that must be won, or at least a bronze medal earned to be able to unlock the S license  TESTS so that the rest of the races can be unlocked. I do not have good eye sight, as a result of Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (if anyone reading this has M.S. I believe it should stand for Mercury Saturated, look at the known health effects of Mercury toxicity and compare those with your symptoms. Any silver filling you may have in your mouth is 50% mercury, I had ten of them, the progression has mostly stopped since having them PROPERLY removed) that has put me in a motorized wheelchair basically every waking moment. The crazy difficulty of this race combined with my poor eyesight has kept me from even being able to attempt the S-license tests. The thing I have always loved about Gran Turismo is the endurance races. I love racing cars, and I really wanted to see any improvements that may have been made to the pit stops since Gran Turismo 5. I have collected every single car that I could find in GT5. In GT6 I have purchased a 2 million credit formula car, which I will never be able to race with until I get my S-license. I've currently got 4 cars (not counting the formula car) with over 700 performance points each and so far have not been able to get third place or better in any of the races I need to pass to unlock the S-license tests with.How Gran Turismo 6 could have been a 5 star game, and how Gran Turismo 7 could very easily be a 5 star game in my book:Every Gran Turismo game has had TONS of cars and a whole lot of race tracks. Why are there less races than there are cars??? They should make at least one race that is exclusive to every car in the game and then just add lots and lots more races to the game. It is supposed to be a game about racing, Right? Put the cars and tracks to use in a huge way. I do not care if there are all kinds of races that I will never be able to win, but make a ton of races that everybody will be able to win, and structure the game in a way where everyone can at least have access to starting most any type of race that is in the game. Winning races is of course based to at least some degree of skill, but most people who participate in any race are not going to be the winners of the race. Gran Turismo is supposed to be about racing, so please let people get into the races, that is what anyone wants to do that buys a Gran Turismo game. This would make the replay value potentially nearly unlimited and in my book would make it a 5 star game.Damage and the ability to turn it on or off would of course be a fun plus. I have loved the Red Bull X cars, and I really like the future prototypes that look to be added to GT6. Hopefully eventually I will unlock the S-license tests.Notice even with my bad review, I have not totally given up on the game. There is a lot to like, but the amount of frustration drives me to the point of wanting to give up. Frustration is basically the opposite of fun. Frustrating and hard races can be ok, but they should be optional races that do not hinder reaching major portions of the game. I would love to see Gran Turismo 7 sell 100 million copies, due to it being massively fun, fun, fun. Like it very easily could be.Update 1/4/2014One good thing to wait for maybe? B-spec mode when released may make it easier to get the super license tests opened up, so that the other races will unlock. This would be very positive, also grinding in B-spec for money should be much easier.One more very irritating and FRUSTRATING thing with gt6. Apparently they really wanted to showcase how totally lame, totally lame tires function. So for ALL of the races I have seen so far, the BEST tires you can use is racing hard. This would be great for someone, if there is someone, who really loves driving really powerful race cars, that go totally out of control any time you want to do something like turn your car. Realistic behaving tires are fine and good, but it is NO FUN to be forced to drive on lame tires while trying to catch up to cars that were a half a lap ahead of you, when the race began.
I've never been so disappointed in any game for the PS3 as much as I have been disappointed in Media Molecule's "Little Big Planet."  This was one of the worst video game experiences I've ever had in my life.Initially I thought I was going to love it because of the cool graphics.Unfortunately, they made it too hard.  One of those British idiots decided to only allot you 4 lives per section. But some of the sections are infuriatingly difficult, so when you fail them, you have to go back to the entire beginning of the level.  Why couldn't they have just given you infinite lives?  That way, the game would have been fun to explore and savor.  As it is, you don't want to bother collecting anything (e.g., the stickers) because there's no guarantee you'll survive the level, and if you don't, all your work will have been for nothing.And when you are bounced back to the beginning of the level, you won't think the graphics are so fun anymore.  In fact, this entire game has overtones of punishment.  The sad part is, this could have been easily fixed:  they could have either:1. given you infinite lives;2. given you infinite jump ability;3. made it so that your character can grab on to ledges and pull himself up;4. or at least allowed you to save and load from your last checkpoint, so that you can practice only the part you're not getting.5. allowed to you pay your unused lives forward;6. or at least had different difficulty settingsor something.But making you go all the way back to the beginning of each level was pure viciousness.  It's just torture with a cutesy face!  I'd like to meet the gamer who is agile enough to make it through the "Wheel of Death" in the "Bunker" level, yet who is excited about earning a "flower print dress" at the end.I don't mind games being difficult.  Lord knows I've made it through some pretty hard video games.  What I do mind is all your work being incinerated and not counting for anything and having to do it all over again.  Again and again.I suspect the reason Media Molecule set it up this way is that if they hadn't, you'd be able to finish this game in about 3 hours, so little content is there.  But making it so that if you die 4 times in any one section you have to repeat the entire level, this was a way, I suspect, of making the game last at least 2 or 3 days.And most of the time you die, it's not even your fault.  See, this game isn't 2D.  It's not 3D.  It's somewhere in the middle (I believe programmers call this "2.5D").  It looks like a 2D platformer, but there are actually three lanes you can be in:  the foreground, the middleground, and the background.  The problem is that, not only is it hard to tell what lane you're in in any given moment (you're not allowed to pan the camera about), but the game thinks nothing of bouncing you back and forth between these lanes without your having requested this, such as when you bump in to a wall or when you land from a jump.  So you'll keep dying on a lot of the jumping challenges because you can't make out where on the Z axis your character is exactly, or which lane your target spot is in.When I first saw this in the store and fired it up, I thought it was some sort of science game.  The kind where kids would play a cute character and learn about gravity, friction, temperature, whatever.  Actually, it's the complete opposite of a science game:  it teaches kids not to explore . . . exploring is not worth the risk, because likely you'll wind up getting electrocuted and have to start the stupid maze all over from the beginning.And here's the final insult:  the game claims that it saves your data "automatically," except that it doesn't, or at least it doesn't do it predictably.  I had serious problems with this.The day I finished this game, I had played it for about 12 hours straight:  straight from, I think, the Serpent Shrine all the way up to the Collector, whom I finally defeated at about 3:00 in the morning.  My games were not saved, even though I went back to the "Pod" several times during the course of the day.  After finally defeating the final boss, my save game only showed that I had made it up to the "Endurance Dojo."  Why did it save up to that point but no further?This was definitely not on account of my having shut my PS3 off at the wrong moment:  having experienced this before and having assumed it was owing to some fault of mine, I, after finishing, took great pains to exit using the circle button to get all the way back to your spaceship where it says "Use Pod Computer" so that it would definitely save the fact that I had finished the game.But even that wasn't enough to get it to save my game.  There's no way to force a manual save, either.  In short, the creators of this game owe me a completed game file, because I'm sure as heck not going to go through those levels again!  And I need hardly mention that the wankers at Media Molecule won't permit you to use another user's savedata file.  (I currently believe you have to exit to the PS3 and choose "Quit Game" for your data to be saved . . . still not sure, though.)Truly the worst game I know of for the Playstation 3.  I didn't have a minute of fun with it.  I regret every moment I spent with it.  I thought I was going to be treated to all sorts of eye candy but was just in a rage the entire time I was playing it.  My poor wife.Lesson learned:  avoid all titles by Media Molecule, or titles for which you can discern that Mark Healey or Alex Evans had a hand in making.  They make games evil on purpose and then market them as though they're for kids.Here's hoping Media Molecule soon goes out of business!  And may 10,000 camels poop on the graves of its programmers!
I got the game for free because I bought the Xbox One Titanfall bundle.  I figured I might as well get the bundle to receive the game for free.  I must say, I'm glad I went that route instead of spending $60 on it.I can't really think of a redeeming aspect other than it's good for some mindless action gaming when in the mood for it.  And, when in the mood for that, it gets the job done.  That's why I give it 2 stars instead of 1.  Now, for the reasons I don't think much of this game.The graphics aren't impressive.  If I walked into a room and saw someone playing this, I wouldn't know if I'm looking at a Xbox 360 or Xbox One game.  Before anyone tries to claim it's because my TV is not good, I'm playing on a 52-inch Samsung 1080p LCD.  My TV is not the problem.  The game's environment is muddy for the most part, there is a lot of brown everywhere you go.  I also don't see any environmental destruction.  If you shoot a wall with a titan's cannon gun, the wall is still standing after the smoke clears.  Enemies can hide behind a barrel the entire time, no matter how many missile shots it takes.  The story is worthless, I don't care about it or any of the characters in the game.  It's as if Respawn tried to create something meaningful, but what they delivered is not interesting at all.  Two factions are fighting over energy on different planets with no characters to base the story around, at least that's what I think is happening.  I understand I'm a grunt, but shouldn't there be somebody leading this story to its conclusion?  Each match basically boils down to running around and killing as many opponents as I can or capturing an enemy's flag.  I don't know why I'm doing it, but I'm doing it nonetheless.  "Campaign" mode is not a traditional campaign mode.  It's online multiplayer with the previously mentioned attempt at a story.  It is one online match after another, there is nothing to develop a story aside from banter by a couple of digital faces that appear on your screen via the HUD as they try to convey drama and a sense of desperation that simply is not there.Speaking of online multiplayer, it's 6 vs. 6 at all times.  Why are there so few players on a next-gen console?  Instead of providing more human opponents, the game fills the maps with mindless bots who can be dropkicked (literally) to death as they stare at you with their guns pointed at you for 5 seconds.  Fighting these bots reminds me of the scene in Monty Python and the Holy Grail where Sir Lancelot approaches the castle on a loop for about 30 seconds as the guards watch him the entire time.  They then seem surprised when he reaches them and stabs one with his sword, just like these bots are unsuspecting of your run toward them with your lethal dropkick prepared to impale them to their digital deaths.  The humans who are in the maps are mostly running around like chickens without heads spraying and praying until their 24-foot tall robot is available for occupation.  Once in the robots, the humans continue their spraying and praying tactics without trying to achieve any objectives, such as capturing the enemy's flag or a waypoint.  There is no organization as a team in this game, just people sprinting and floating with jetpacks in an attempt to get as many kills as possible so they can see a high number next to their name after the match is complete.  If you play with friends who are dedicated to playing the modes the way they're intended to be played, I'm sure the experience is slightly better.  But, if you're playing with strangers, it's an all-out mess of a rush with no direction.The audio is decent, nothing spectacular is happening.  The sounds of gunfire are heavy and the footsteps of the titans are satisfying.  But, the audio isn't of a quality I haven't heard before.In the end, this is just another frantic FPS with no real reason to play for an extended period of time other than trying to level up.  But, after leveling up, then what?  The weapons are not plentiful as in other FPS games, so the variety is pretty limited.  When playing Titanfall, I feel like I've already played the game a hundred times before, but with different titles.  Nothing about it says "next-gen" to me, nothing.  I feel like I'm playing Call of Duty on the 360, but with robots thrown into the mix and stupid bot enemies/teammates to make the experience even worse.  By the way, the novelty of robots wears quickly, especially after you see how fast they're destroyed by opponents.  A titan falls from the sky, gets a few rounds off, and then explodes seconds later because an entire team's attacking focus is on that titan.  Players wait 2 minutes for 15 seconds of robot action.This game is not the recipe for excitement, longevity, next-gen gaming, or fun.  It is my opinion that this game was very much overhyped and not worthy of some of the high praise we have all seen.  I would not recommend it to a friend.Edit- For those saying my review is not helpful, can you please leave some feedback as to why it didn't help you?  I commented on the visuals, audio, gameplay, and story.  Knowing how I can improve my review would be very helpful for me.
It's depressing when one of your most anticipated game releases leaves you wishing you had bought something else.  Sixty bucks is a lot of money to waste.The first Mercenaries title was - in my opinion - a major milestone.  Taking the Grand-Theft-Auto sandbox design and filling it with military vehicles, crazy gun fights and massive explosions.  The original game was not without its flaws, but I actually think this game has far more.The Cons:Oh goodness the graphics.  I think a lot of gamers feel that graphics are an aside - as much as graphics are touted by major reviewers, publications, etc, us gamers just don't really seem to care that much.  If a game is really, REALLY good, we'll look past some frame rate issues and bad aliasing.  But Mercs 2 - good God - did they port this off of a Gameboy??  When you're in a race and obstructions literally pop up in front of you around a corner - that's not good.  When an enemy is shooting at you from 50 yards away and yet the engine hasn't actually drawn him yet - that's not good.  The colors are extremely flat - trees, buildings, people - almost all look the same.Topography is another issue - many times I've watched my character get killed because I was literally stuck in a rut the depth of a curb.  I've also gotten stuck between rocks many, many times.  It is incredibly frustrating watching an action game turn into a platformer because you're trying to jump out from a few rocks.Fun...  The game just isn't that fun.  A lot of strategy has been compromised for action and explosions - neither of which are that good.  In the original mercs, you could subdue a "high value target" - referred to in that game as a "deck of cards."  You could then take your subdued target, toss him into a vehicle (The Hummer H2 was my favorite) and drive out of an enemy base, camouflaged as a civilian.  This was one of my favorite things to do.  So imagine my surprise when I knocked out a HVT in Mercs 2, ran up to my truck, and couldn't load the target inside.  In the following explosion, my HVT was killed and I lost half of my bounty.  Why did they take that element out of the game?The air support has become bigger and in some ways, better.  There are a LOT of things you can call in this time, and you don't have to worry about keeping a faction happy to keep the supplies rolling in.  However, you have to stop moving, select what you want to call in, and throw your beacon for things like artillery support, fuel bombs, etc.  Of course, most of the time you'll catch a rocket in the face for your efforts because you're not moving!  Why you have to stop to throw an air support beacon is beyond me.  This was obviously never beta-tested.The story - if you can call it that - is pretty poor.  There's no indication as to when missions become available - you literally have to make your rounds among your increasing number of outposts and H.Q.'s and find out what is available to do.  The first couple times I found myself thinking, "now what?" only to realize that I had to go talk to someone to find out what was available.  I guess it's good that Fiona - your... ...boss?... ...keeps nagging you to return home so she can give you suggestions.Good Lord the voice acting...  I don't know if the same guy did Mattias as in the last game, but he obviously spent some time hanging out in suck city between projects.  He is without a doubt the worse voice-actor I've ever heard.  Was this guy trying to impersonate Shatner?  It is literally so bad, I've begun skipping the conversations simply because I can't stand it.So what's good?  The vehicles are okay - I really liked the combat ship I stumbled across - rocket launcher, two side-mounted turret guns and a butt-kicking front-mounted cannon.  The helicopters are more varied and capable - sorta...  My favorite part was using a helicopter to drop a gigantic gas tank onto the deck of a large tanker ship - the ship was a target I was asked to destroy.  The gas tank landed next to two additional gas tanks on the deck, and after a few seconds of bouncing around, the first tank exploded, igniting the other two.  As the ship exploded in a glorious fireball, I sat there laughing almost uncontrollably - it was just cool.  Too bad it took 6 hours of game play to find a good part.What else would you like to know?  No, the physics aren't any better.  Driving is a tiny bit easier, but cars slide like you're driving on teflon-coated ice...  They stop okay and such, but get out of a car while it's still just slightly moving, and you'll walk a half-mile to catch up to it - that is if it doesn't slide off a cliff or beach.Mercenaries 2 is... ...it's an insult to the engineers who made Mercs 1 such a great game.  Gone is the flair - no neat animations when you subdue a target.  Instead we get minute-long tank hijacking sequences.  For every item Mercs 2 tried to improve on the original, they slacked off on two items that Mercs 1 did great.  All in all it makes for a pretty lackluster game.  I'm sorely dissapointed.

This would be a great game, had Konami already not released five (six when the American Idol one comes out) better Karaoke games for the PS2. You would think that when releasing this game in 2006, Sony would look at its competition and make it equal or better. They did not. I apologize that so much of the review is comparing it to the Karaoke Revolution series, but it's a natural comparison, and unfortunate for Singstar Rocks, as SR is by far an inferior product.I have a lot of the same complaints as others. There are no unlockables. Even though KR's strange costumes are seldom used in our household, it's nice to see things being unlocked as you sing more and better. Singstar Rocks does not do this.The big thing is with the PS2 having two standard USB ports, why they would utilize the mini to USB adapter. This renders the mics useless to the KR games. If they're worried about being able to use an EyeToy simultaneously to two mics, maybe they should have included a USB mini hub instead. It infuriates me that with all the decent USB mics on the market that Sony again would go proprietary (of sorts).Another complaint is the lack of adjustments. In song, KR (dating back to the original) allows you to adjust the vocals, mic and music. Singstar Rocks has only a master volume that doesn't see to do much.It's also unfortunate that Sony stuck with only Sony artists, as they are missing out on a ton of others. The song selection is very random due to this and a couple are very strange selections to have on a sing along disc. There are multiple songs on here that do not make a lot of sense. Of all the Rolling Stones catalog, why would Forty Licks' "Paint it Black" be the one to appear. Lame!In a vacuum, the game is fun, but its song selection, lack of options and its proprietary options all make it fall extremely short to any of the other Karaoke Revolution. Don't waste your time with this one. Get *any* of the KR series over this one.

I could understand Guitar Hero and Rock Band not having any non Rock & Roll songs.  But SingStar has no excuse with this kind of song selection since it is being marketed as a Karaoke Game.No Motown, no classics, just bunch of songs that the guitar hero and rock band demographics might be familiar with.
I got this game after purchasing a PS3, thinking that even if this game wasn't all that great, I could use the two microphones (which came with a USB adaptor) for Karaoke Revolution games.  I was wrong.  Because the microphones are not actual USB mics and have to plug into a USB adaptor, Karaoke Revolution games do not detect these "SingStar" mics.Secondly, SingStar does not give you the option to remove the lead vocals from the songs.  This defeats the whole purpose of Karaoke.  Even on Karaoke mode, the lead vocals are still there.Lastly, The game has a very small selection of songs, and there are a handful of tracks that are "medleys", which are basically a medley from choruses of the same songs that are already on this game.Conclusion.  This is NOT a Karaoke game, as it does not give you the option to strip the lead vocals, and the microphones included with the game are not compatible with any other games for the PS2 or PS3.  If I was given the option, I would give this game ZERO stars.

This game shows off the PS2's graphical prowess, or what passes for graphical prowess on a PS2.  The controls are very easy to pick up, and if you don't demand anything from your games then this will probably satisfy you.  However, I found that collecting power cells and eco was a tedious task rather beneath someone of my intellectual stature.  The physics of the game were astoundingly poor; who ever heard of a &quot;double jump&quot;?  Even on the moon, with its unique gravity, Neil Armstrong was unable to do a double jump, and so the suggestion that a spiky-haired cartoon character can transcend the laws of physics is both preposterous and offensive.Furthermore, it has been noted in countless reviews that Daxter, the sidekick, is not irritating, and even perhaps amusing.  Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong!  You plebians know nothing!  Daxter is the Newman of video games characters, the annoying sidekick that you hope will go away but never does.In conclusion, the game looks nice, plays nice, but is ultimately boring and undeserving of my attention.  Go play Dynasty Warriors or SSX Tricky instead!

The physics of the game were astoundingly poor; who ever heard of a &quot;double jump&quot;?  Even on the moon, with its unique gravity, Neil Armstrong was unable to do a double jump, and so the suggestion that a spiky-haired cartoon character can transcend the laws of physics is both preposterous and offensive.Furthermore, it has been noted in countless reviews that Daxter, the sidekick, is not irritating, and even perhaps amusing.  Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong!  You plebians know nothing!  Daxter is the Newman of video games characters, the annoying sidekick that you hope will go away but never does.In conclusion, the game looks nice, plays nice, but is ultimately boring and undeserving of my attention.  Go play Dynasty Warriors or SSX Tricky instead!
All of our "old" Wii Guitar Hero and Band Hero games have worked fine up until this game.  You just start the game and everything is automatically recognized.  The mic and drums have no problem.  I've done some checking online and others have had this problem too.  Your original wireless Wii guitars show up as microphones - not guitars, so I guess you have to go out and buy new versions of your Wii wireless guitars if you want to play this game?

Goldeneye Rogue Agent one heck of a bump in the road...Goldeneye Rogue Angent starts off in Fort Knox in a training virtual reality and from there you wish you didn't waste your money...Goldeneye Rogue Agent is an extreamly fustrating game, hundreds of people looking to make you kick-the-bucket (to die) You as some rogue agent is sent to complete some objectives that have nothing to do with the story line. But that of course is because there barly is a story line within this game. youpretty much just shoot, shoot, and shoot some more. And most of the time I'd be okay with that but this game throws there 007 feel right out the window. it put's you in a futureistic age and put you in verry unbelievable levels.You get an arrange of weapons, some are awesome, but have to actually warm up before you fire em' or you get a pistol that dosn't do heck of alot.This game rank's verry low in my 007 list's of likes. It was a waste of money and most of all a waste of inginuity from the makers of 007 video games. It makes a farce out of a good 007 game...JRF01...

Don't be fooled, this game sucks.  I got it for my birthday last year, and it doens't match up to 007: Goldeneye (one of the best games ever made), so don't be fooled

This game, when I first fot it, was the best. But now when I think over the plot, it is very stupid and immature. Goldeneye (the main character) turns evil because MI6 won't accept him as an agent. You can wield two guns at the same time, which is kind of cool, but what is he, some mutant evil cowboy. After you use up all your weapons you have to use and extremely weak pistol with unlimited ammo. And after under cover for 2 seconds your health goes back up! The multiplayer is extremely boring and confusing. And the game has an extremely weak plot that revolves around Goldeneye turning against Goldfinger and Oddjob. This game is extremely stupid. DON'T GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!

The Nintendo DS, as innovative as it is, just can't do a few things correctly. It isn't a very good floatation device. It won't get you to the moon. It also can't handle a first-person shooter. This is very evident in Electronic Arts' port of Goldeneye: Rogue Agent. Rogue Agent is so heavily flawed in some aspects that it makes it difficult to enjoy the game at all.The story of Rogue Agent DS is pretty much a pointless add-on to a generic and clunky first-person shooter. Basically, as a rogue MI6 agent, your goal is to assist Goldfinger in his pursuit against Dr. No and his evil henchmen. The gameplay itself is mauled by a horrible control scheme, which is utterly painful in execution and jumbles up any sort of entertainment that could be found.The only real way to control the game is with the strap-and-thumb piece that came packaged with the Nintendo DS. This wouldn't be such a big problem if it just felt a little less awkward. I practically had to do finger warm-ups in order to stretch them out far enough to hit the shoulder buttons while I was using the thumb piece and directional pad. The small - and inconveniently placed - GoldenEye power-up icons don&#8217;t help one bit either.The gameplay isn't only hampered by the control scheme. The single player missions are limited in number and are void of any entertainment whatsoever. It seems that there are only four or five different enemy skins throughout the game, so I found myself blasting away at the same dull baddies that never really posed a threat. In fact, the only time I died was near the end of the game when some of the enemies carried single-shot-kill weapons. This was made more frustrating by the lack of checkpoints in each level, meaning that I would usually run through the same boring hallways and rooms only to die in the same spot.Fortunately, Rogue Agent DS carries a slightly stronger point in its graphics. They don't look like they're from the Nintendo 64 era (like many other DS games). The corridors are a little bland in some spots, but overall the game looks nice and runs at a very constant speed. I found it a little odd that enemy characters don't react to bullets -they sit and suck them in like human shields. Rogue Agent DS has taught me that in the future, nameless grunts are really walls in disguise, that or Kevlar has gone a really long way.I wish I could give the same praise to the music and sound effects, but the effects themselves are very bland, typical shooter stuff that has probably been recycled a few times. The music is so bad that it's almost a good thing. Anytime I ever have an annoying song stuck in my head, I'll sleep well knowing that Rogue Agent DS sounds much worse in every way.In conclusion, a decent multiplayer mode doesn't save a broken game. Goldeneye: Rogue Agent on the Nintendo DS is the first shooter on the console, and if they're all going to feel and play like this, I'd like it to be the last. Unless you're a real sucker (like some sort of Ultra Dum-Dum sucker) for wireless multiplayer shooting, you're not missing anything in this game.
GameplayDespite all the promotional hype behind EA Sports' BounceTek dribbling system, handling the ball ends up being one of NBA Live 14's weakest aspects. Maneuvering your player using only the left joystick feels decent enough, but once you start mixing in crossovers and hesitations with the right joystick, the dribbling animations begin to lose their fluidity. Special moves often interrupt the normal flow of dribbling in a spastic, unnatural way, making it difficult to time your controller inputs to the irregular rhythm appearing on screen. NBA Live 14 could have benefited from including a sound effect slider just for the ball itself, as I found it much easier to chain together dribble moves when I was listening to the rhythm of the bounces instead of trying to follow along with my player's jerky dribbling animations.The inclusion of signature dribble moves and unique dribble rhythms for more than 50 players does add some much-needed personality and animation variety to NBA Live 14's gameplay, but even after spending over 20 hours using mostly the same lineup of players, the dribbling still doesn't feel right or look natural. BounceTek ends up feeling like a bunch separate animations sloppily spliced together rather than the uninterrupted sequence of smooth, consecutive dribbles gamers were promised.Along with its player-specific dribble packages, NBA Live 14 also includes 300-plus signature shot animations. The real-life resemblance isn't particularly strong for most of the shooting forms, but it's at least something to help differentiate players from each other.Aside from the personalized dribbling and shooting styles, that vast majority of NBA Live 14's animation library seems to be shared across the game's entire roster. Basic player movement, post moves, defensive stances, passes and rebounds all animate similarly, if not identically, across the 5 positions and 400+ players in NBA Live 14. Capturing individual athletes' personality and on-court mannerisms has become one of the early hallmarks of &#8220;next-gen&#8221; sports gaming. But when you combine all these generic animations with NBA Live 14's embarrassingly low-detail player models, you get a basketball game that looks decidedly &#8220;last-gen.&#8221;Even NBA Live 14's control scheme feels &#8220;last-gen,&#8221; as the lack of a directional &#8220;shot stick&#8221; to guide the ball towards the rim makes the simplistic post-up system extremely difficult to enjoy. Far too many close-range shots get unnecessarily blocked because the game decides on a completely illogical shooting animation instead of following a clear lane that would have easily gotten the ball up to the rim.The drop step move, for instance, can be used during backdowns to create a wide open path to the hoop if you read the defender correctly. But by the time your big man transitions out of the drop step animation and into a shooting animation, the defense can easily recover and contest or block what should have been a sure score.Trying to pass the ball around the basket doesn't fare any better, as the directional passing icon will often lock onto the wrong teammate when there's a lot of player traffic. NBA Live 14's lengthy throwing and catching animations are so slow to play out, that on the few occasions where a pass does go towards the right player, the defense will still have plenty of time to recover while the ball slowly floats through the air, stopping what should have been an easy assist.You know something's wrong with a game's passing system when alley oops are the safest, most reliable method for picking up assists in the paint. Even then, lob passes still take far too long to &#8220;charge up,&#8221; as they use the same poorly designed power mechanic. NBA Live 14's fast break opportunities are also limited by the floaty passing and poor reception animations, as players will often spin around and come to a complete stop instead of catching outlet passes in stride.It is common in NBA Live 14 to see both teams finish with double-digit block and steal totals. Computer teams often give the ball away by throwing ill-advised passes to players who are being tightly fronted. There's also a bizarre bug that tends to occur two to three times per half where an AI teammate will completely ignore a pass coming his way and just stare down the ball as it strikes his lifeless body or bounces out of bounds.Despite all the rejections and thievery taking place, personal fouls rarely occur in NBA Live 14. Most games against the computer finish with no more than three to four fouls for both teams combined. Given how easy it is to run through the paint for turbo layups, turbo dunks, and hop step/euro step runners, NBA Live 14's lack of consistent charge calls and shortage of contact animations make driving the line an unstoppable offensive strategy.With no gameplay sliders to adjust, and each NBA rule being limited to a simple &#34;on&#34; or &#34;off&#34; switch, the only times you'll see stoppages in play in NBA Live 14 are when a ball deflects out of bounds or a team uses a time out.One excellent option that NBA Live 14 has included is the &#8220;ratings only&#8221; shooting system, which uses a player's attributes, and not the timing of his release, to determine whether or not a shot goes in. With the &#8220;ratings only&#8221; option turned on, teams in NBA Live 14 shoot a reasonable 40% to 50% from the field, 30% to 40% from three and 70% to 80% from the free throw line. It's disheartening, however, that this great gameplay feature is limited to offline modes only.Dynasty ModeNBA Live 14's greatest achievement is its 30 unique coaches, with each bench general taking a different approach to defending your team. Pick and roll tactics, double teaming principles and ball pressure strategies all vary from coach to coach, making each team play differently in the defensive end.The computer will even change its defensive strategies dynamically on a player-versus-player basis. So if Kyle Korver gets off to a hot start from downtown, expect your opponent to start double teaming Korver every time he touches the ball until his shooting cools off.Coaches are even smart enough to recognize when they have a matchup advantage or disadvantage, as the Indiana Pacers' Frank Vogel would let center Roy Hibbert use his superior size and strength to defend Marc Gasol one-on-one in the post. But as soon as Zach Randolph would start backing down the undersized David West, a double team would regularly come to force the &#34;Bully on the Block&#34; into a pass.Unfortunately, for as great as NBA Live 14's team-specific coaching is on defense, there seems to be very little variety in how computer teams play offense. The AI's primary offensive gameplan is to throw the ball down low to a forward or center, then just stand back and let that player go one-on-one. Many times, the computer big man will end his backdown by taking a hop step towards the baseline, leaving him behind the backboard or over the end line. Other times, the computer's bigs will attempt a slow face-up jumper that is easily swatted away.NBA fans would expect the San Antonio Spurs to be running lots of pick and rolls between Tony Parker and Tim Duncan. But NBA Live 14's version of the Spurs prefer to keep feeding Tiago Splitter the ball in the post so he can go one-on-one against Marc Gasol. What's even more disturbing are the few times when the AI's bizarre gameplan actually works, like when CPU Splitter's body clips right through the 2012-2013 Defensive Player of the Year, then rises up for a slam dunk over Zach Randolph's flat-footed help defense.After playing on All-Star difficulty against roughly half of the NBA, the Los Angeles Lakers and Golden State Warriors were the only computer offenses I faced that closely resembled their real-world counterparts. Los Angeles started most of its possessions by isolating Kobe Bryant on the wings or hitting Pau Gasol in the low post. Golden State, conversely, had Stephen Curry running dribble isolation and pick and rolls from the top of the key. On occasion, the Warriors would even move Curry to shooting guard so he could come off some staggered screens for catch-and-shoot jumpers from the wings.Human coaches will have a difficult time running real sets with their team if they choose to call plays from NBA Live's 14 team-specific playbooks. AI teammates slowly jog into position during set plays, never displaying the sharpness or urgency that a 24-second shot clock demands. Computer players coming off picks seem unable to square their shoulders to the basket during catch animations, often turning should-be catch-and-shoot situations into awkward-looking, easy-to-block, turn-around jump shots.If you have trouble finding any suitable plays on the d-pad, you can try calling for a pick and roll by holding down the left trigger. I emphasize &#8220;try,&#8221; because there are occasions where pressing and holding the left trigger inexplicably draws no response from your computer teammates.As with set plays, pick and rolls in NBA Live 14 take entirely too long to develop. The center or power forward needs a second or two to process the command before he slowly jogs over to the ball handler's position, then he'll still take another second or two to rotate his body for the screen. When the pick is mercifully set, there's about a 50/50 chance that the on-ball defender's body will clip directly through the screener, rendering the pick useless. If the defender and the screener do manage to make contact, the effect is usually so minimal that the defender will just slide back into perfect defensive position before you can get even one step ahead of him.While NBA Live 14 also lets you instruct individual teammates to get open or set screens using various d-pad and face button combinations, this is far too many inputs to manage while trying to keep your dribble alive and prevent your pocket from getting picked. To a certain degree, the responsibility should fall on a game's AI programmers, not on the player, to ensure that AI teammates maintain proper spacing and are generally in helpful positions. NBA Live 14's teammates are anything but helpful, as they constantly have to be told where to go and what to do if you don't want them standing around idly, staring at the poorly rendered cheerleaders and fans. Turning on the &#8220;Auto Motion&#8221; feature just makes NBA Live 14's off-ball movement an even bigger mess, as it causes AI teammates to move around erratically and illogically instead of maintaining a set position that you can pass back to if you get into trouble.In my Memphis Grizzlies dynasty, I immediately acquired Kyle Korver, J.J. Redick and Jos&eacute; Calder&oacute;n via trades to bring in some perimeter players who could knock down open threes whenever Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol got double teamed in the post. And while those players helped spread the floor as spot-up shooters, I was disappointed to find only one play in Memphis' playbook that I could use to create off-ball screens for my new trio of sharpshooters. As dynasty mode rosters inevitably change over time via free agency, trades, retirement and the draft, it seems shortsighted to not include any way to alter a team's playbook during dynasty mode.You do, however, have a full staff to control, including a team trainer, doctor, scout and separate offensive/defensive assistants. Investing experience points into your supporting staff will help your players' attributes improve and help to prevent injuries from occurring. You can earn XP by completing in-season goals, like going on a 5-game winning streak or having a player selected for the NBA All-Star team.As your team travels from building to building, NBA Live's 14's courtside commentators (Mike Breen and Jeff Van Gundy) and studio reporter (Jalen Rose) will often reference the previous night's action, with each game adding to your season's narrative. Watching Jalen Rose's excellent halftime and post-game presentations is almost more fun than playing the actual games. It is disappointing, though, that Rose never appears on screen and provides only box scores, not video highlights, for the out-of-town games.NBA Live 14's dynasty experience is heavily isolated around your team and your team only. Stat sheets and single-sentence text recaps are the only bits of information you'll receive about other events happening around the league.When using NBA Live 14's TV-style &#8220;ESPN&#8221; gameplay view, you'll notice that the camera is set up in a different location for all 30 NBA arenas. But gamers who prefer to play from a top-down, overhead perspective will be disappointed to see that both the &#8220;Baseline High&#8221; and &#8220;Baseline Low&#8221; views stutter frequently, running between 15 to 30 frames per second depending on the arena and the crowd's temperament. NBA Live 14 is virtually unplayable from anything but the &#8220;ESPN&#8221; and &#8220;EA Sports&#8221; broadcast cameras, which both maintain 60 frames per second during gameplay. However, any time a whistle blows and the game transitions to a cut scene, the frame rate drops dramatically until the cut scene finishes and you're returned to the normal gameplay camera. Players will also teleport across the court during cutaways, making these moments a major eyesore.Dynasty mode also suffers from some stability issues, as three times I've started up a game, only to have it crash back to the PlayStation 4 dashboard with the error code &#8220;CE-34878-0.&#8221;Online PlayEven if you could theoretically find an opponent who never uses the overpowered hop step/euro step button, only uses turbo sparingly, and doesn't run into the paint at full speed every play, you still wouldn't have any fun playing NBA Live 14 online due to the insane amounts of latency.I'm trying to think back to another online game that featured this much lag, and I just cannot come up with anything else that's comparable. Not even NBA 2K1 on the Sega Dreamcast, which ran dial-up Internet through a 56K modem, lagged as badly as NBA Live 14.The latency cannot be a result of overloaded servers, as the game lobbies have been empty every time I've checked.Nonetheless, there are two degrees of lag in NBA Live 14:75% of the time, the game stutters and moves frame-by-frame like it was being played in slow motion. These games are completely unplayable.25% of the time, the game runs at fairly normal speed, only with user inputs registering on-screen several seconds after the buttons are pressed.With online shooting success being largely dependent on release timing, jumpers become impossible to make when the player on your television is releasing the ball two to three seconds after you let go of the shot button.As a defender, staying in front of your man or contesting a shot is equally impossible when there's a two-second delay in sliding over to the left or rising up to make a block.In short, playing a basketball game with this much latency is about as fun as dribbling a basketball without any air.Final ThoughtsAside from its deep defensive strategies and sharp ESPN presentation, NBA Live 14 has few redeeming values. On the court, NBA Live 14 shows a brand of basketball that is ugly to watch and frustrating to play. It doesn't matter whether you're playing offline, against the simple-minded, slow-to-act computer, or competing online, where the lag is so bad that you can't make a single jump shot.The end result is that paying $60 for NBA Live 14 makes about as much sense as paying $600 to watch an NBA D-League game.NBA Live 14 is easily the worst title in the PlayStation 4's holiday lineup and a stinging, flagrant foul against longtime fans of EA Sports' increasingly irrelevant basketball brand.Visuals &#8211; NBA Live 14's low-detail player models and choppy animations look downright embarrassing when compared to every other PlayStation 4 launch game. Both overhead cameras are currently broken, stuttering frequently and running at no more than 30 frames per second. Players warp into position during every dead-ball cut scene, causing the frame rate to dip even further. During gameplay, players limbs will often clip through the ball and through each other.Audio &#8211; Crowd volume will swell or subside based on the amount of on-court tension. Organ music and crowd chants give games a believable atmosphere. The commentary duo of Jeff Van Gundy and Mike Breen is generally enjoyable, though too repetitive and quiet at times. &#34;Wired for sound&#34; cut scenes use coach-specific audio captured from actual NBA huddles, though it's odd that these moments are only shown during studio reports and not during stoppages in play. Smart soundtrack design grants gamers the ability to turn off individual songs at will.Controls &#8211; There's a persistent feeling of disconnect between your controller inputs and your player's on-screen animations, particularly while dribbling the ball. Lengthy throwing and catching animations plus a poorly conceived &#8220;charge up&#8221; mechanic ruin the passing game. The lack of a directional &#8220;shot stick&#8221; hurts the post offense, causing too many blocked shots around the basket. Even with the &#34;Auto Motion&#34; feature enabled, off-ball movement is overly dependent on user-initiated button presses instead of relying on smart AI programming.Online &#8211; Relentless latency makes it impossible to accurately time jump shots. Most online matches lag so badly, they look as if they're running with a slow-motion cheat enabled. Ultimate Team is missing an auction house and the ability to challenge friends. Standard online modes like 30-team leagues and team play are curiously absent.
Next gen is here and according to Sony, &#8220;Greatness Awaits&#8221;.  It looks like greatness may have to wait a little longer though because &#8220;Killzone Shadow Fall&#8221; definitely isn&#8217;t it.Now don&#8217;t get me wrong.  If drop dead gorgeous, but painfully generic first person shooters with aggravating and pointless free fall/flying sections are your thing, and you love games that are hollow, shallow and soul-less to their very core-plus you are completely opposed to anything that even resembles action in your first person shooter then you are in for a monster treat here.For fans of the Killzone Series however, outside of a few cut scenes there&#8217;s really not much here that immerses you into the rich universe that is Killzone.  There&#8217;s no longer a sense of being a star player or a hero in an epic war raging between races.  There&#8217;s no sense of urgency or feeling that you are immersed in an epic battle to save mankind.  Honestly there doesn&#8217;t seem to be much of any kind of threat here at all when it comes down to it.  There&#8217;s lots of walking around though.  Lots of walking around.  See that waterfall over there?  Yep.  You get to walk over to it.  See that scientist?  Yep.  Instead of shooting and blowing things up (who wants to do that?), you get to walk with her for a while.  You also get to experience the joys of meandering aimlessly through large and completely barren terrains not having a clue where you are going because your direction indicator doesn&#8217;t work half the time, just hoping you finally stumble onto your next objective before you throw your controller and say &#8220;screw it, this game sucks&#8221;.  There&#8217;s also a bit of walking in the dark.  I especially enjoyed these areas of the game where it was so dark on the screen I could barely see anything at all.  The walking experiences I had there were particularly memorable.  I can honestly say that I have never experienced a game quite like Killzone Shadowfall where so much loving devotion was given to recreating (to the last detail) the entire experience of being a pedestrian.So if you like trekking through large empty spaces completely alone and desperately searching for an enemy (or even TWO!) that you can finally kill, and you can&#8217;t stand too much action in your first person shooters-Killzone Shadow fall is your launch game of choice this holiday season.For the rest of you odd ball types who actually want some action and intrigue in your first person shooters, do yourself a HUGE favor and skip this piece of Hellghast spawned dog s*** and pick up the Killzone collection for PS3 instead.  Even KZ1-dated as is it is still an enormously more fun game to play than Shadowfall.If Guerilla games wants to take the Killzone series in this new direction for PS4 this generation-that&#8217;s fine.  Count me out though.  Call me crazy, but I still like to have &#8220;fun&#8221; when I play videogames, not just look at pretty eye candy as I&#8217;m traipsing along the countryside with no one around and nothing at all to do.  Oh, I forgot-the inclusion of the new OWL is pretty cool though.  So there&#8217;s that I guess.  Shadowfall was easily my number one choice of launch games.  Of the three PS4 launch games I&#8217;ve played now, Shadow fall ranks dead last with a bullet.
Got this to complement MySims Racing, an amazingly fun game, but this game was just amazingly dumb, with no sound and music options, which means you have to suffer listening to midi sounding electric "music"...and you wont be able to turn down the 2 or 3 primitive exclamation type sound effects that are repeating continuously. Graphics are cheap, undone, almost 2D.Plainly unbearable for the musically and visually inclined. Doesn't worth $10.

The major problem I had with 2004 was that there were too many 5 star players in the recruiting process and the teams that performed well enough, inked most of the five star recruits.  The problem that created was that after about three or four seasons I began to notice the dominant teams that signed the bulk of those players were unbeatable.  By the end of your seventh or eighth year, there were anywhere from 12 to 15 undefeated teams at seasons end. I haven't played 2005 enough to be positive that this problem has been fixed, but from just the first two seasons, it definitely appears so. There are actually upsets in 2005. That's about the only improvement I can name about 2005.Another problem with 2004 was that all you had to do was draft a fast QB , roll out of the pocket, approach the line of scrimmage to draw in the linebackers and DB's and then heave it downfield to your single covered receiver for a 40 yard gain. I was left hoping that EA would fix the defensive AI to recognize and defend that. Did I ever get what I asked for!  Overall, 2004 worked offensively.  2005 is an entirely different story. My QB usually completes about 20 percent of his passes, and I can never rush for over 50 YPG.  Toggle the AI settings, someone suggested?  Even the worse teams will roll over my D and I still can't seem to complete a pass or run the ball, even with the defensive AI on the dumbest level.  Sometimes I can move the ball well but usually end up punting or turning the ball over in my red zone. On the highest setting, all my games end about 10-7, both teams under 100 yds total offense.  On all-american, I score all the points and accrue all the offense with Baylor while OU gets battered by my unforgiving "C+" Defense. When you come out of your huddle, the AI defense is ALWAYS in the right formation.  If you try to audible, the defense counters your audible before your guys even move!  So you throw a pass to a seemingly wide open receiver, here comes five supermans flying in to break up the play. You try to keep the ball on the ground, but the defensive linemen blow past your O line and are on you like stink on poop!  My favorite is when you're running a sweep or an off tackle and your FB is in front of you and you see a beautiful run developing.....only to have Willie, Mike, or Sam effortlessly run right past your FB and smack the daylights out of you ( Your FB doesn't even make an attempt to block). Or you have a great drive going and you penetrate the red zone, you get sacked 3 times and have to punt or you fumble the ball if you try to keep it on the ground.  Ridiculous!Defensively, there were problems that were a problem in 04 but are dominant in 05.  It doesn't matter what setting I am playing on.  I can hold OU or Texas under 100 total yards of offense with the Baylor (C+) defense, while their defense holds my offense to the same figure. In my first season, I Had the #117 ranked offense, and the best defense ever to grace the gridiron of Division 1-A Football.  I held a top twenty five team (don't remember who) to -63 rushing yards and 30 passing yards on all-american. That's just not fun to me.I have beef in other areas of the game too, but wouldn't be able to fit it here. Suprisingly, I think EA is on the right track with this one, but major gameplay problems are the hindrance.  I recently played NFL 2K5 from Visual Concepts.  A flawed game no doubt, but a good one nevertheless.  At the end of the game, all of the statistics and scores, everything, looked realistic.  If EA could incorporate some of that realism into this NCAA franchise, it would no doubt be the best football game ever made.
The major problem I had with 2004 was that there were too many 5 star players in the recruiting process and the teams that performed well enough, inked most of the five star recruits.  The problem that created was that after about three or four seasons I began to notice the dominant teams that signed the bulk of those players were unbeatable.  By the end of your seventh or eighth year, there were anywhere from 12 to 15 undefeated teams at seasons end. I haven't played 2005 enough to be positive that this problem has been fixed, but from just the first two seasons, it definitely appears so. There are actually upsets in 2005. That's about the only improvement I can name about 2005.Another problem with 2004 was that all you had to do was draft a fast QB , roll out of the pocket, approach the line of scrimmage to draw in the linebackers and DB's and then heave it downfield to your single covered receiver for a 40 yard gain. I was left hoping that EA would fix the defensive AI to recognize and defend that. Did I ever get what I asked for!  Overall, 2004 worked offensively.  2005 is an entirely different story. My QB usually completes about 20 percent of his passes, and I can never rush for over 50 YPG.  Toggle the AI settings, someone suggested?  Even the worse teams will roll over my D and I still can't seem to complete a pass or run the ball, even with the defensive AI on the dumbest level.  Sometimes I can move the ball well but usually end up punting or turning the ball over in my red zone. On the highest setting, all my games end about 10-7, both teams under 100 yds total offense.  On all-american, I score all the points and accrue all the offense with Baylor while OU gets battered by my unforgiving "C+" Defense. When you come out of your huddle, the AI defense is ALWAYS in the right formation.  If you try to audible, the defense counters your audible before your guys even move!  So you throw a pass to a seemingly wide open receiver, here comes five supermans flying in to break up the play. You try to keep the ball on the ground, but the defensive linemen blow past your O line and are on you like stink on poop!  My favorite is when you're running a sweep or an off tackle and your FB is in front of you and you see a beautiful run developing.....only to have Willie, Mike, or Sam effortlessly run right past your FB and smack the daylights out of you ( Your FB doesn't even make an attempt to block).

All defenders can outrun Messi and Ronaldo. Referee do not blow rough play. Two of my players against the goal keeper all the players behind i pass ball to my teammate and it's offside i guess they have invisible players. The game is very slow and you have to keep holding the ball and turning around to move. who ever changed the fifa 13 passing with this crap needs to be fired. Here is me using my goal keeper to pass ball to my teammate and he cant trap the ball.
It seems EA will never fix their obvious AI problems.  Yet each year they add more gimmicks without fixing one of the main problems in their football game.I haven't bought Madden since Madden 03, and I will not buy another Madden title until they fix the AI problems.  I am sick of having CPU's sub par running backs breaking 5 and 6 tackles on 3rd and 6 just so they can get a first down.  QBs breaking tackles from LBs who outweight them by 100 pounds.  How about the CPU always allowing your CB's to be out of position when the CPU passes the ball, and on top of that, they slow the CB down to give the receiver a better chance to catch the ball!  Sub par receivers making leaping one handed catches in tight coverage while getting hit.  Passes going through defenders' bodies, helmets, hands, legs, arms etc. to end up in the receiver's hands.  Balls changing direction in mid air just so the receiver can catch it.  The CPU intentionally making tacklers dive in the opposite direction you expect them to, turning a would be minimal 2 or 3 yard gain into a maddening 20 yard gain.  Your defenders all seem to be conntected by a string so if you go in and dive to make a sack and miss (and most of the time you will miss or the QB will miracously break the tackle), your defender who is guarding the intended receiver, will automatically dive too if you switch to him, resulting in a BS 50+ yard TD pass.  The CPU automatically moving your linemen across the line on 3rd and 10, to give the offense a free 5 yard and then the CPU gets exactly 5 yards on the next play.  CPU QB's getting off perfect passes while having a LB inches from taking him down.If your offense you have to deal with your all star 95+ rated receivers dropping wide open passes.  All star QBs throwing balls out of bounds. All star RB's fumbling at the worse possible time.  You lineman are moved across the line by the CPU and you get flagged for a false start.  Your linemen miss obvious blocks so big gains are rare in a close game. Your QB automatically tucks the ball and takes a sack if a defender is 10 feet away, while the CPU QB can get a perfect pass off while he's being sacked almost.  Psychic defense that almost always know what play your going to run.  Refs almost always get in the way of your receiver when you absolutely need to convert a 3rd down.And who can forget the infamous comeback AI?  No lead is safe.  Even if your up by 20+ points at the half, your better off running the clock out starting in the 3rd quarter because the AI will do any and everything to get the lead and screw you; that includes your offense fumbling the ball, receivers dropping wide open passes, refs constantly calling clipping and holding on you after you get a good punt return or big gain.  Refs calling you for face mask penalties or pass interference after you stop the CPU on third down so the CPU can get a free first down, bad calls in the final two minutes of the game so you can't challenge.On special teams I have seen where I was lined up for the game winning field goal and I see my play clock is about to run out, so I call a timeout with 2 seconds left on the clock. The screen signals that I called a timeout, but a few moments after I call a timeout, the ref throws a flag AFTER the timeout was called. and I get pushed back five yards. Talk about a LATE whistle. Another occasion the CPU punted to me, and the ball CLEARLY went out of bounds at the 35 yard line. It was way beyond the side line and in fact nearly to the end of the thick white line; however the ball bounced back in bounds and the CPU downed it at the 21 yard line. I was so shocked, that I saved the replay. No matter what this CPU does to screw me, they always do one better everytime I play the game.I have experienced these things and more in Madden.  More so on defense.  while these problems certainly don't happen in every game, it happens on average every other game.  Sometimes the CPU will cheat on every single down making it impossible to win. Most of the time however, I can usually still win in spite of the cheating, it is still very frustrating when the CPU can constantly pull 60, 70 and 80 YD TD passes out their a$$ just so the game will be close.  This ruins the experience of an otherwise fun game.  I still play 2003, because I want to at least get my money's worth and play all 30 seasons while drafting college players from NCAA 2003.  After that, I will never even think about purchasing or playing another Madden or NCAA title again.For me, gone are the days that I rush out and buy the current year's sports title.  It is usually the same game as the previous one.  However, if you absolutely want a football title this year, get ESPN, and while it has its problems too, it is certainly a much better deal being only 20 bucks versus 50 bucks for Madden.Since the folks at EA are shaking in the fear of a little competition from ESPN, they have decided to purchase the NFL liscense exclusively for themselves so no other companies can make NFL games.  Because of this I suppose I won't be buying any football titles for the next 5 years.  Even IF EA fixed their obvious game problems during these 5 years, I STILL wouldn't buy Madden or NCAA ever again.  I don't even know if I will buy another EA game period.  I am sorry I just can't support any company that buys their way out of competition.  So long EA!

The Madden on the psp is better than the 360 for the second year in the row. Its unbelieveable that precision passers throw 2-5 a game in 08 for 360. This game is not offense minded at all. Randy Moss, Lavereneus Coles and even Devin Hester can be caught up in this game. Its a d@mn shame. This game looks great though, But until Madden relases its stranglehold on the NFL rights and have some competition, these are going to be some lean years for EA.
I admit it, I have something of an ulterior motive in rating this game so low.  It's a good football game, really it is.  However, after playing EA Sports titles for the past decade, I've discovered a football game I like much better.  Unfortunately, because of EA and the NFL's greed, exclusive rights to NFL licensed products has been granted...meaning we will not get an ESPN NFL 2K6 game.  Hence, I will no longer be playing EA titles.  For any serious gamers out there that welcome competition among our titles, thus ensuring that the best products are available, join my in my boycott.  Like I said earlier, I prefer the bulk of EA's sports titles to the ESPN brand.  However, I think their NHL and NFL products are surperior to EAs.  But I'll no longer have a choice in NFL products.  I'm not happy with either EA or the NFL.

all the way to the bank! Ever since EA Sports bought the exclusive rights to the NFL License, Madden NFL hasn't changed much except for the usual roster updates, slightly more polished graphics, etc. I wish that Sega Sports could still make NFL games because the NFL 2K series was the best football sim around. I would even rather play an old NFL Gameday (Sony CEA) rather than this overrated pile. Back in 1997, Madden NFL 98 lost in sales to NFL Gameday 98 because it was inferior. The next year EA Sports improved and went back to being the #1 selling NFL game. Then in 1999, Sega Sports released the breakthrough NFL 2K which destroyed Madden NFL 2000 gameplay and graphics wise. EA Sports hasn't made a Madden NFL as good as NFL 2K EVER, although they have always out sold Sega Sports NFL 2K because of better name recognition/marketing. I hope that Electronic Arts exclusive NFL License ends soon in the next few years because Madden needs competition like NFL 2K and NFL Gameday to stay fresh!Anyway about this game: EA Sports must have lost all inspiration for making a new Madden NFL game every year, because this game simply feels stale. The graphics are clean and smooth for the most part, but the gameplay feels really slow and the controls are stiff and unintuitive. Controls are the worst for kicking field goals/punt/kick offs. If you absolutely need to play a new football game then I guess you should buy this lame piece since Madden NFL is the only game in town these days... :(
I bought this game, because if there is one thing I could expect, it was that the EA NHL series was always getting better. I was wrong this time. EA took a step back on this.PS2 revived Madden, it should have done the same for the NHL series. The commentary is [bad], the rosters, I won't even go there (shame on you), the AI; EA has promised better AI every year and I still score at will!Rosters need to be better updated for 04. The franchise mode needs to be more "Maddenized" and so do the custome teams. This year, I recomend Sega's NHL 2K3 and I never thought I would say that.

Catwoman is one of those games that gives licensed properties a bad name-something really depressing as movie-based titles were starting to gain respectability with The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay and Spider-Man 2. No, Catwoman fumbles the ball-from the moment you press start there's nothing but frustration. You play as Patience, a woman left for dead, but instead of pushing up daisies, she's revived/saved/resurrected by cats. Somehow her small furry saviors imbue her with cat-powers (or something like that), which translate into a limited repertoire of flailing punch-kick moves, expertise with a whip, and other purchasable powers that are available as the game progresses. Catwoman commits every action-adventure platform-jumper crime imaginable: lousy camera angles, incomprehensible level designs, and a lame combat engine. And for an agile character, there's really nothing stealthy about her: enemies mindlessly charge, and no matter how you slice it, one really shouldn't have to spend endless hours trying to repeatedly make a near-impossible jump. The awkward controls don't help much, either. Actions are primarily limited to the triggers and analog sticks, and combat is an infuriating visual mess thanks to the camera that has a mind of its own. Unfortunately, Catwoman will surface on store shelves before this review appears. Too bad: unaware purchasers of this title will probably quickly relegate it to the litter box.

What a generic title. Given the game, that's par for the course. The Legend of Dragoon is certainly the most generic game I've played on the Playstation. It's sort of sad, in many ways, that it was released by SCEA only months before Chrono Cross and Final Fantasy IX, and over a year after Final Fantasy VIII.What's generic about it? Damn near everything. The main character is a spiky-haired blonde dude whose small village is destroyed by an evil empire, and who is designated the "chosen one" by a pendant, previously possessed by a mysterious stranger. Can you even name how many other games that borrows from? Do numbers go that high? And I forgot to mention, his representative color is red. Of course, the empire is still on the prowl, and Dart has to chase them with a diverse group of heroes.And that's not even touching the translation- The Legend of Dragoon boasts some truly embarrassing translation errors. Square learned this lesson after Final Fantasy VII, which took a lot of flack for its stereotypes and writing, but that game had an interesting setting and strong enough characters to make up for it. The Legend of Dragoon wasn't just several years behind, it was at least two games behind by PS1 jRPG standards.While the story is generic and perfunctory, it's not really the problem. Let's talk about the combat. The Legend of Dragoon's basis for combat is a series of timed button presses known as "additions." When one chooses the attack option, a reticle focuses in on the enemy, and a button must be pressed to time with the animation. While this basic idea has been done in other games, like Vagrant Story, Final Fantasy VIII, and the Mario and Luigi series, The Legend of Dragoon makes it the core of combat, and that's a fatal error. While timed button presses were integral to the games I mentioned, the important thing is that they didn't slow down the combat. The Legend of Dragoon's combat forces you to do this chain of animations every time you click attack, and when you miss, you get to see your character freeze in place as a number appears only once in front of the enemy. Random encounters, which are the majority of the game in RPGs, take forever and feel clunky. The Dragoon transformations- a flashy sequence comparable to Power Rangers- are also longer than necessary and the Dragoon attacks do little to change my complaints about the rest of the game.The look of the game is very generic as well. While the pre-rendered backgrounds of the game look fine, the character models outside of combat are simplistic and poorly animated. The in-combat look is marginally better, and while the Dragoon transformations look good, the default character models aren't very detailed, and neither are the enemies. The combat environments look especially poor- many of the floors and walls are a single polygon with a blocky texture applied to it.As far as I'm concerned, the great-looking cinematics don't count when we're talking about graphics, though it is worth noting that the ones in The Legend of Dragoon look great. But you might as well jump on youtube and watch all of them instead of playing the game, or rent Advent Children or The Spirits Within, or Shrek for that matter, if that's all you care about. The art design of the game doesn't lend itself to Playstation's technology.I hesitate to speculate on matters like this, but The Legend of Dragoon strikes me as an attempt by Sony to cash in after the success of Final Fantasy VII. The game looks an awful lot like that game, with a fantasy setting substituted for a steam/cyberpunk one. I wouldn't call that an improvement.

White Knight Chronicles follows Protagonist, that nameless, faceless soul that we are expected to create and love, as he takes a job as a wine seller and delivery boy. Along the way, you're drafted into the kingdoms army to help fight off monsters and gigantic robotic armored suits to rescue the princess Cisna. Why are you, a wine delivery boy, with no formal training, magical ability, or even a remote tie to the kingdom or Princess willing to do this? Um... moving on...Graphics and audio are typical starry eyed JRPG to the nines. Awful dubbing and bizarre, choppy speech that are the hallmarks of virtually every bad game made since Final Fantasy. Backgrounds and character models, as well as cinematics are fluid and well produced, but the degree to which the characters speak like they have some kind of paralysis induced by learning a new word is laughably disappointing. Many scenes will proceed like this:Character A: "...Its the &lt;Noun>."Character B: "(whispered)...&lt;Noun>..."Character C: "(frightened whisper)...&lt;Noun>?"Combat is innovative in that you aren't locked into the Attack, Magic, or Item routine. Different weapon classes have different skills, which can be setup beforehand into combos that are useful, easy to determine, and actually a challenge to pick and choose the right setup to get the best bang for your buck.The degree to which you can customize Protagonist is astounding, and you could easily spend an hour creating a borderline clone of yourself as an avatar. And just don't be disappointed when you have to flush all that work down the commode, as the REAL main character is Leonard, the White Knight, who was fortunate to have spoken lines in his cinematics.Overall, this is a major disappointment. Good graphics, a good combat system, and a tolerable story that made the makings of a solid 3 - 4 star game are completely crippled by the fact that your character is dealt off to the side with a deus ex machina that's as subtle as a gaping chest wound. I've never played a game where you're expected to create a character and have him wind up as the lackey to a high schooler.
It's a great game, but when you get everything, you realize that there's nothing to do on it anymore. It's not even fun building realtionships, getting jobs, getting promoted, and winning Drius's penthouse. I RECOMMEND THE SIMS BUSTIN OUT IT IS THE SEXIEST GAMMA EVA

The PS4 controller's analog sticks are much better for shooters than the PS3 controller. They're more in line with the Xbox 360's (plus the controller has a better d-pad). Why did I give it a bad rating then? Because the analog sticks can peel within days. It's hard to say how common this is, but threads about the peeling analog sticks are all over gaming message boards. A controller should not do this within a few days of use. I've been using analog sticks since the N64, and the PS4 analog sticks are the only one to give me trouble. I've had two controllers now, and they started peeling with gentle use. Sony should replace these controllers with free shipping.

"Zelda Killer?" Only if that means copying Zelda in every way imaginable can make it superior. "A league of its own?" Not exactly, file this one with Legend of Dragoon as a predictably unoriginal, mediocre RPG. If you're looking for that game that will pick up this slump of good software for the PS2, you'll have to wait even longer.Now let me clarify this: I have not played Zelda 64 nor do I own a N64. I did not hear about how this was going to be a copycat of Zelda until I finished reading someone else's review a few minutes ago. That said, I still felt like I was playing a rather effortlessly made copy of it. For sheer curiosity, I tried Zelda at a friend's house. Even the grunts Link makes in-battle seems to be stolen from this game.What is the gameplay like? For "Zelda-virgins" such as myself, it was pretty good at first. It was easy to jump into, and hard to put down for the first 5 hours or so. Good, until, after quite some time in the game, nothing really happens in the storyline (a Sony RPG trademark) and after hours upon hours of repetitive gameplay (yet another Sony RPG trademark), it failed to keep me within its grasps.The graphics, while good, are nothing spectacular. They quickly get tiresome when you're in the same dungeon for 5 hours or more. Every level of the dungeons look the same, so if you have a high tolerance of environments as repetetive as the gameplay, you'll have no trouble there.And here's another staple, the immense amount of typing errors, the third sign of a Sony RPG. While there isnt much text, it was enough to make me want to send money to Sony to buy a spell checker for the sake of pity.Georama is almost innovative. It would be if Sim-City hadn't done this general idea first, and if it gave you more freedom. The villagers are very picky as to where their house should be placed. So picky that you'll wonder why Sony even bothered to let you build these villages at all.In general, buy this if you liked "Legend of Dragoon" or if you've never even heard of the Zelda series.

The game starts off with an intersting opending and quickly goes down hill from there. As soon as Jak opens his mouth to speak, I began to have my doubts. Everything he says he is nasty and his vocal tones are those of the nastiest villians. Granted he is supposed to be under the influence of dark forces and he is grumpy from two years of torture, but still he sounds more like a stock villian then a hero whose fate you are supposed to care about it.The level designs are also unrelentedly difficult. From the very beginning you are faced with challenging moving platforms and with a couple of levels you will be chased by a relentless cannon while jumping blind repeatedly. Poor camera angles, lack of camera control in crucial areas, make already difficult jumps nearly impossible as judging depth is often not possible  and more often then not you are forced to jump blind because you can not see where you need to go next.Rarely is there is no time to pause to study your move and try to rotate the camera (which at some crucial spots simply refuses to budge) because crumbling ledges, firing cannons and their ilk force you to keep hopping from one awkward ledge to the next. You will be forced to endless repeat difficult segements, memorizing the exact route as you will often need to jump blind in order to complete levels. Finely you make it through a difficult segement only to fall off a tiny ledge that lures you off the side by tempting goodies, or shot by an unseen gun, only to be sent bake to the beginning, forced to repeat what you thought mastered until you eyes blur over and you forget why it is you are playing the game. Only sheer stuborness will force you to continue.When you are not being frustrated by the pooly paced and un-balanced levels, you will be bored by the endless travel by foot or awkward vehicals that you can steal, needed to get between levels, which the game refers to as missions. This aspect of the game might have been amusing as a single section but is otherwise pointless. The vehicals can only be flown at two heights and there is little room to manuver. Everyone just bangs into everyone else. It is like an endless game of bumper cars to get from one place to the other.Eventually, if you persist, you will realize that both the level difficulty and endless crisscrossings of the hub city to get to each level are only there to pad out what otherwise be a very brief game. It's a shame really, because the story is interesting, the levels bright and intriguing and with just a bit of tuning could have been really fun rather then really frustrating. If ND really wanted to be innovative, there would have a variable level of difficulity and maturity settings. As it is this game will only appeal to the teenager or adult who finds most platforms a piece of cake and longs for a real challenge.

Any enjoyment you might derive from this game is from playing as Jet Li in an old-school fight setting.  When the novelty of that wears off, what you have left is an incredibly repetitive game with a godawful camera and an ill-advised control scheme.Yes, bonus marks are in order for using Cantonese in Hong Kong with subtitles.  (As a native Hong Kong person I can say the dialogue is less stilted than usual, though still flawed)  Though I might add that international espionage games like Syphon Filter has been doing that for years.  The settings are authentic enough, with the battles in the Hong Kong settings being especially evocative of kung fu films.But is it worth the very problematic gameplay?  Just barely.  If you've seen/played the demo already, you'll know that the entire fight system consists of slapping the right analog stick.  While the array of moves you can unleash is impressive, motion-captured well from Li's own silhouette, this system is very ill conceived from a fighting-game perspective.  Worse still, the camera is so restless that you could be in the middle of a combo against an enemy, and then the perspective shifts so that you're suddenly hitting at air and the enemy's to the side.  So many game designers have misled notions about being filmmakers, not realizing that the best perspective for gaming is a fixed perspective.  This problem came to a head during the ludicrous "escape from capture" stage where the camera actually cuts you off, preventing you from seeing what's behind you, even though there are guards sweeping flashlights that way that you're supposed to avoid!  This is simply a moronic use of the camera.Aside from this, the fighting gets tired awfully quickly, especially since the designers committed the ol' "this level never ends" sin.  This game alleviates this problem by having lots of checkpoints where you can continue the game, but during some of the "one against 14" stages, the endless brawling still gets tired.  And whose idea was it to have enemies pull off 18-hit combos, where if you get hit the first time, you get to watch your character get pummelled for 10 seconds straight?I actually find the gunfight segments of this game more fun than the endless, endless hand-to-hand stages.  This is where the dual analog sticks truly shine, allowing you to smoothly run from spot to spot forwards and backwards while your hands can aim independently and a top button allows you to do Time Crisis-style ducking.  There's even a crazy level where you fight off about 100 enemies with two nailguns!This game would probably remain tempting to Jet Li fans because of the role-playing aspect of it.  And I wouldn't blame them -- this was my reason for buying this game, and there are a few levels that I truly enjoyed.  The overall game, however, is really not that great, and I would recommend only playing it in small doses.  It will get tired mightily quickly if you sit with it for more than an hour.

The Medal of Honor games have always been great.  Until now.  This game should be a free download for anyone who still has Frontline.  It is short and the AI, as far as I can tell, is actually worse than in the previous game.  The &quot;Pacific Battlefield&quot; looks like a sandwich made out of doo-doo brown and mud.  Real pretty it is.  I couldn't tell much difference in the scenery from being down in a Phillipine sewer and running free on the beachhead (sp?)  The gameplay is a little tedious, as well.Maybe it is a good rental...This is worth about $10 +/-.If you pay $50 for this then I have a broken 32x for the Sega Genesis with no cables for just $200.  That's cash only, and this is a one-time offer.  Send all payments to:Raoul Drake515 Pensacola Hooker Ave.Shattaboulasuchi, LA 99999999-9999.Stay sober!

I bought this game because the sales charts revealed it was a top-seller... But now that I've played it, I can only assume that everyone else was as duped as I was. This game is terrible. The graphics, I will admit, are amazing, but the game play is just down-right uninnovated. You can't take shortcuts (even tho the box says &quot;careen off the dirt path&quot;) and the machinery isn't different enough.They did spend a lot of money on the music and instruction booklet, as the first includes tracks from Alice in Chains and Soundgarden and the later which is a full-color 49 page manual. But if you want a good off-road racing game, buy Rumble Racing.

How can you have a game where all the characters are Japanese, the setting is Japan, and yet have all the characters speak in U.K. English with U.K. accents? Talk about spoiling a great thing. Siren 2 is supposed to be on the horizon, and hopefully the game's makers will come to their senses and include the Japanese audio track for all releases. It could have been right up there with Silent Hill, but instead the realism, and thus the intensity and scary factor, is lessened because of the lack of a Japanese audio track, which could have been easily included since this game was released in Japan with such an audio track. Those responsible for releasing this in America must have made a major mental lapse -- I hope so, because if they actually sat down and thought of some "reasons" to not include the original language track, then there's simply no excuse, no justification. Ridiculous, just plain ridiculous.

I remember seeing previews for this game a couple of years ago; beautiful, sweeping lanscapes and dragons floating through the sky. I decided to buy the game about a year ago (I was poor, and waiting for the price drop). I had hoped that this could fill the void as I awaited the release of Final Fantasy X on the Playstation 2.Well, FFX has come and went, as have countless other games, and I STILL cannot muster the energy to put the sad, sad "Legend of Dragoon" out of its misery. I don't even know where to BEGIN damning this game, so let's begin at the beginning...Firstly, who in the WORLD conceived the lousy, pitiful soundtrack? From the opening title screen on, it seems as if the music was composed by some hair-metal band after a suicide attempt. And the plot? Can't Squaresoft sue? I mean, I have never seen a bigger ripoff of Final Fantasy VII, from the spiky haired lead character to the silver haired foe leading him by the nose across the world! Unfortunately for all, the results are far inferior to the Square offering...Also, who in the world TRANSLATED this thing? (I assume it is translated, I HOPE it is translated, I PRAY it is translated, sigh). Every character needs about a paragraph to say what could be thoroughly explained in a sentence. Does anyone even CARE about these characters? I sure don't...Oh, let's not forget the battle engine. Before every (RANDOM) encounter, the screen melts away like sand, followed by a sweeping camera laying out the poorly drawn field of battle, followed by a shot of the characters, and then one of the monsters. This happens before EVERY battle! I estimate a good ten hours of playtime is wasted just from this...Oh, and the battles? Don't even get me started. I will describe but one of the (uncountably infinite) shortcomings: a character can only cast magic while in the "dragoon" state. This makes every battle unbearably long, and expect to be hit with a random encounter every 5 seconds or so...I guess I'm left to ask, "What was the big deal?" Personally, I feel sorry for the schmoes who plunked down full price for this stinker (and apparently there were a lot of you; this game is a best-seller!). I suppose this is the reason for the ridiculously high rating this knockoff has received. Well, if there is anyone else thinking of buying this, DON'T! I hope the rant has dissuaded you! ZERO STARS!!!

Silent Hill in space and just about as annoying. I understand the tension that the developers were trying to create and they succeed but this is ridiculous.  Constantly low on ammo with weapons so defective the manufacturers would be promptly put out of business all the while being attacked by hordes of wrench wielding, regenerating zombies.  You aint gotta chance and thank heavens for cheats or I wouldn't be bothered.  If you could get it for under 10 bucks go for it and kill some time.  But I sure wouldn't spend the money that is being demanded on Amazon.

Sony gave it a good try but the game is too frustrating. The story begins with part of the Japanese landscape gone to Hell. The population has been turned into killer zombies called Shibito and you have to survive and find out what happened to the town. You can &quot;Sightjack&quot; so you can see through the eyes of the shibito, which is pretty scary, but you really don't care because as soon as your starting to get emotionally invested with your character you switch to another one. The accents do not fit the characters, and the color palettes used in the game a very drab looking. Be prpared to die and restart alot. Silent Hill 3, The Suffering, and Fatal Frame 2 are better choices.

This game is awful. Very bad graphics by a first person shooter. Ugly, bland enviroments with bad atmosphere. Seems they went bachward from the first one. They now added a multiplayer mode witch is essential to a good FPS, tobady is sucks. I never understood what was going on and it is easy to get lost in the jugle witch all looks the same to me. Get red faction 2 instead. Did't live up to the standard as the first one and is a huge disappointment.

This game was and is so hyped I thought it would blow its competitor at its release Devil May Cry 3 out of the water. It had decent action but no where nere the fun or variety of DMC 3 with annoying button combos to pull of finishing moves, this worked in RE4 when it was used sparsley and to make you watch cut scenes but is over used here.  Had it not been so hyped I would have given it 3 stars as a rental, but it is worthy of 2.

Este juego es solo para ser jugado en red, tremenda limitante!!! Tomen esto en consideraci&oacute;n cuando decidan comprar este juego.
I was playing the game and somewhat interested in it at first, but it really didn't make any sense.I had no idea why I was fighting demons right off the bat when I wasn't even in hell. And then I noticed that after the first cut scene with Beatrice, I begin fighting right away with no explanation at all, in an entirely different place.The gameplay itself is like Devil May Cry without guns. Just about everything is copied. You have the combos ranked in name by the cool factor of the game, you have the level design, the way the bosses and mini bosses come up, the button mashing. It just doesn't do it as well as Devil May Cry. Even the upgrading is a lot like DMC.I heard the game was a great big God Of War ripoff, but I'd say it's a DMC ripoff.Finally what made me stop playing the game however, was the glitches. I encountered a few minor ones, but the worst one was that demons can throw me through the firewalls put up to block your path, and this freezes the game. Because then you are on the other side of the fire wall, where you are not supposed to be, and the game decides to hold everything in place. You can only access the menus, no moving, even the monsters stop moving.I didn't find the plot that interesting either, nor did it make much sense what I played.

I expected downgrade textured since it was a port but... Game was unplayable, many times dipped to 10fps and would crash. Had to return to amazon for refund.I heard a new patch will fix these issues, but I'm not gonna wait.Warning to trophy hunters. The vita version trophy list is shared with ps3. No new trophies I'm afraid!
&quot;EverQuest: Planes Of Power&quot; was obviously designed to cater to &quot;Uber-Guilds,&quot; an expression used in the EverQuest online community to denote player guilds which are rather advanced in skills and prior experience, and large in numbers. The single adventurer, as well as the casual gamer or relative newcomer, will find little to no content whatsoever which is available to them in this expansion pack (past a certain point). It is all about groups and large scale raids. Solo gameplay in the &quot;Planes of Power&quot; zones is next to impossible, and that is appparently by design. In fact, several player class abilities were &quot;nerfed&quot; by Sony just prior to the release of this expansion, ostensibly to &quot;better balance the classes.&quot; It is far more likely that those &quot;nerfs&quot; were enacted to prevent any possibility of traditional solo classes (such as Wizards and Druids) from being able to do any effective soloing in the new zones.Another problematic feature of this add-on is the overpowered &quot;gear&quot; that one can obtain from the high-end encounters featured in &quot;PoP.&quot; Introducing too much &quot;uber gear&quot; to an MMORPG game is precisely what ultimately ruined &quot;Diablo 2&quot; when the &quot;Lord of Destruction&quot; expansion was released. For many gamers, the focus becomes shifted away from roleplaying and game content, and instead toward greed for items which they can strut and show off to other players. It also tends to make player characters who *can* manage to obtain those items a bit too powerful, which hardly seems to fit in with Sony's highly questionable assertions... that several prior ability nerfs were done to &quot;better balance the classes.&quot; If anything is true about &quot;Planes of Power,&quot; it's that it is decidely UN-balanced in the extreme.Painfully short on game content, all too few and sloppily written quests, overly lengthy encounters and a generally poor payoff in the &quot;Plane of Time&quot; endzone are what one can expect from this mediocre expansion pack. Whilst it is a &quot;must have&quot; for all EverQuest players, it hardly stacks up well against prior expansions such as &quot;Scars Of Velious&quot; or &quot;Shadows Of Luclin&quot; so far as actual depth, atmosphere and overall content is concerned. This is also the first EverQuest expansion set which the original game designers (Verant International) had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with, and it shows. Moreover, &quot;Planes Of Power&quot; is an expansion pack which 99% of all players will never see the bulk of, due to their being unable to assemble the &quot;muscle&quot; required to fully explore the additional zones and adversaries. Not being able to see three quarters of a game you pay for is rather disappointing (to say the least), so unless you already belong to a highly-skilled player guild, do not expect to progress past a very superficial point in this add-on to EverQuest.Lastly, &quot;The Planes Of Power&quot; tends to look and play more like a Sony PlayStation 2 game than an add-on for a classic PC based MMORPG. Storyline depth and roleplaying content has been replaced in favour of eye candy, overpowered enemies, and ridiculously and unnecessarily overpowered items designed to appeal to player egos. &quot;PoP&quot; is not entirely without merit, but depending on what you look for in a roleplaying game, you may be disappointed overall. Defenders of this add-on have often said to me  &quot;Well, Sony knows what sells, that's why PoP is the way it is, and that's the bottom line.&quot; Naturally, I have no problem with manufacturers of PC games making a profit on their merchandise, but I see no reason why profits and product integrity need be mutually exclusive concepts.Thumbs down overall, but a necessary add-on for all EverQuest players.

The general consensus amongst the MMORPG community would seem to be this: EverQuest II is yet another example of Sony's fanatical obsession with eye candy over content.There's little to no "meat" here... in fact, Sony's own online websites can't seem to provide any sort of storyline behind EverQuest II, other than it being set 400 years or so from the time of the original EverQuest, the moon of Luclin blew up, and now the entire huge, sprawling world of Norrath has been reduced to two measly starting cities, on one continent......sounds pretty cheesy to me. Wanna see another red flag..? The sheer size of the installation of this game positively SCREAMS that it's loaded with resource-sucking bells and whistles, which Sony is well-known for focusing on when their overall storyline and content are weak.Most veteran EverQuest players have watched Sony Online Entertainment completely RUIN the original EverQuest, ever since late 2002 when Sony bought out Verant (the originators of that once-classic MMORPG game). Given what we've all seen from SOE over the past few years (the destruction of EverQuest, the absurdly pointless Star Wars Galaxies, horrible customer service, and insultingly shameless greed), I see absoultely no reason whatsoever to believe that EverQuest II will be anything short of an overpriced, inane memory hog of a "game" that will ultimately leave the player feeling unsatisfied and cheated....

Some reviewers have suggested that the main problem with Dragon Age 2 is that it adapts the world of DA to the strictures of Mass Effect's gaming style, resulting in an unpleasant masseffectification that saps the playing experience of its uniqueness.  While there are a few small senses in which this is true (especially with the adoption of the dialogue wheel), to make this claim is to miss the mark: Dragon Age 2 is simply a downgrade from its predecessor in virtually every way.  If anything, we should be stunned that Bioware, a company which responded to nearly every criticism of Mass Effect 1 for its development of Mass Effect 2, appears to have completely ignored the feedback that they received for this series' previous title, Origins.Perhaps the most crippling issue--and also the most surprising--is the game's poor writing quality.  Dragon Age: Origins set the bar for clever dialogue in gaming, giving gamers an unforgettable experience.  From Morrigan's imperious jabs, to Zevran's lewd humor, to Alistair's goofy commentary, each character's remarks seethed with carefully crafted personality; even the Warden's speech options were routinely witty.  By contrast, the cast of Dragon Age 2 (with the exception of the suave dwarf brigand Varric) is uniformly uninteresting, wooden, and above all, angsty.  You'll groan as Anders and your brother Carver assail you with angry tirades about the mages and templars, sigh apathetically at the totally forgettable Aveline, and shake your controller at the screen in frustration as Hawke routinely makes comments that fail to reflect the options you select on the dialogue wheel.  Possibly worst of all, in a flagrant "screw-you" to Dragon Age's considerable female fan base, this game is utterly devoid of charming male characters to romance, and thus members of the Alistair fan club will find themselves scratching their heads in puzzlement.  One imagines that Bioware's real writing team went on vacation during the development of this game, leaving their collective pens in the hands of the Substandard Amateurs wing of the company.Yet all this does not touch on the second, and equally dismaying, element of failure in Dragon Age 2's writing: the plot itself.  If you were hoping to recapture the sense of epic, sweeping adventure that the lush fantasy world of Ferelden immersed you in during Dragon Age: Origins, then prepare yourself for disappointment.  Instead, as the Champion, you'll be trapped in the dreary hell-hole of Kirkwall, an unimportant city whose defining aesthetic feature is its statues of wretched, emaciated, shackled slaves.  There is nothing wrong about the choice of a "dark" aesthetic per se, which has been utilized to great effect by games like Dead Space, but what is wrong is that there is no corresponding feeling of risk or gravity.  No, you're not fighting against an oppressive force, evil demon, or diabolical tyrant--rather, as Hawke, you plod about aimlessly, wallowing in the general unpleasantness of Kirkwall, proceeding with documentary nonchalance as you complete an endless series of bitch-work tasks for needy and ungrateful citizens or teammates.  But for the occasional swarm of enemies, you might as well be playing Animal Crossing: Ugly Ghetto Edition.  There is no larger goal or driving motivation, no looming threat or call to action, and even the potentially-clever presentation of the narrative through Varric's interrogation is dull and anticlimactic.  ("So, tell me, what did the champion do next??"  "Well, then he traveled north, where blah blah blah...")  Moreover, the entire story is fueled by the conflict between mages and templars, which worked fine as a footnote in Dragon Age: Origins, but as the driving thematic force behind DA2 is nothing short of excruciating.(As a side note, I ask: What's with all the blood mages?  Becoming a blood mage was a huge deal in the first installment, like selling your soul to the devil--something really rare that evoked a strong reaction from people.  In this game, everyone and their dog is eagerly lining up to slit their wrists and summon sinister demons.  Seriously, large roving bands of blood mages will repeatedly attack Hawke's group for no reason whatsoever, and half of the quest arcs end with some character coming out of the blood-magical closet.)I'll admit that the graphics and combat of this game have undergone a significant makeover.  The lush visuals and fast-paced action of DA2 are extremely satisfying.  That said, most of the other technical aspects of the game have either remained in stasis or deteriorated in relation to Origins.  Your teammates' AI is routinely moronic, with healers forgetting to heal and characters bunching together as they're pelted by area-of-effect attacks.  The old cumbersome crafting system has been unwisely retained, if somewhat revamped.  The campsite has been eliminated, and to initiate group dialogue you're now required to visit characters at their own separate households, obnoxiously scattered throughout Kirkwall.  PC armor tends to be visually underwhelming, often leaving Hawke the least interestingly dressed member of his or her band.  Loading times are endless--a factor which I would normally overlook, except the individual landscapes are so tiny that you're hit with a loading screen every thirty seconds to three minutes.  These landscapes, furthermore, are reused, such that you traverse the same dungeons and environments over and over again for different quests.  Finally, the game even freezes from time to time; not ultra-frequently, but often enough to be annoying and mar the quality of the playing experience.All things considered, I have to admit that it's difficult for me to be objective about this game.  Dragon Age: Origins was an incredible experience marred by only a few flaws, and its sequel seems to have exacerbated those flaws while jettisoning some of its better qualities.  If I squint my eyes and imagine that DA2 was made by some obscure indie developer, I find myself thinking that it's good--not great, but merely rental-caliber good; perhaps a notch or two below the Fable games.  However, there is ultimately no escaping the impressive standards which Bioware has set for itself through previous titles, and as with a substandard Pixar movie or Zelda game, I can't help but judge this to be the inferior work of a creative team that knew better.Let's just cross our fingers and hope that the next Dragon Age installment will, like a Fereldan hero who slays evil when all hope appears lost, restore this series to its former glory.

Champions of Norrath: Realms of Everquest grafts the top-down (seen from above) hack 'n' slash action engine ofBaldur's Gate: Dark Allianceonto the names and places that define the world ofEverquest I: The Anniversary Edition.  As evidenced by my reviews ofAlien SyndromeandPhantasy Star Portable, I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to this kind of game.  It has to be pretty awful for me to actually not play it, especially if I have someone to play it with.  My girlfriend decided she'd dive into some game or another with me on the PS2, so we'd be playing together on one screen, sitting together on the couch, nice fire going in the fireplace, and so on.  I happily dug out this dungeon crawler that I'd gotten some time ago, but never played.If you want only to know if Champions manages to deliver on the very most basic elements of this kind of game, then you can stop right here, because this will take awhile.  The answer is "yes," it generally lets you do what a dungeon crawler should.  You have a few different classes, you have a few different locales, you can kill things and take their stuff, and you can keep on doing that for hours, as the game offers three successive difficulty levels, each making the same story progressively tougher for higher level ranges.  It supports up to four players locally with multitap, and has a client/server network mode that is probably based on a server that is no longer running.A few basic archetypes common to this sort of game define the classes; healer, tank, ranged DPS (damage-per-second), and magic DPS, as well as a hybrid melee/magic class.  However, though they hit all the right notes in concept, execution is sloppy, to be polite.  The tank class, while quite hardy, has no real tools for managing aggro (who the enemy non-player characters are attacking), which means that the healer isn't really free to heal, since they're defending themselves instead of relying upon the tank.  The magic DPS class doesn't really do much damage, considering all of the drawbacks it has with such a narrow focus.There's nothing inherently wrong with this sort of gameplay, but it's frustrating to see familiar terms and trappings, sit down to play, and discover that there's really nothing like what was described in the manual, insofar as gameplay, anywhere in the actual game.  It's not really a cooperative multiplayer dungeon crawler so much as it is a simultaneous overlapping single player dungeon crawler.Champions makes use of a pre-patchDiablo 2-style skill tree for each of five classes.  When I say pre-patch, I refer to the fact that when Diablo 2 first released, one of the chief complaints players had against it was that early skills in any given skill tree often felt like they served no purpose other than gating access to higher-level, and presumably better, skills later in the tree.  Towards the end of the game's life, later patches included an update that made earlier skills improve upon later ones in the same line of the tree, such that "maxing" those skills, or raising them as high as the game allowed, wasn't necessarily a waste of points, since it improved the function of a descendant.No such luck in Champions, as we get skills that not only have no impact on later skills in a tree beyond gating access to them, but skills that often seem as though they're only in a certain part of the tree because there wasn't any better place to put them.  With a little digging online, you can find out what each skill does for each class at each level (some classes share a skill, but with different levels of effectiveness by level for each).  However, the game itself has almost nothing to offer in that regard, as it only ever tells you what the current skill level does, and the next level, if it exists.  There is also a surprising lack of skill-boosting gear in the game, at least so far as we've played it.Combined with the all-sales-are-final approach to skill point management, the game progressively feels more and more punishing, as any skill point regret you may suffer can only be assuaged by starting over and being more miserly.  Not only do you have no real good idea how any given skill grows to its maximum level of 20, such as when it hits a point where you would personally consider it to be offering diminishing returns, but if you decide to really commit and dump a bunch of points in, only to discover you wish you hadn't, well.  Too bad.In action, skills are assigned by means of an eight-way radial menu, managed with the D-pad, in concert with either the Triangle or Circle buttons.  This menu can be arranged from the character sheet, and used while playing, without pausing, to assign skills to either button.  When the action ebbs, it's a passable enough system, which manages to pack a whole lot of skills into two teeny, tiny buttons.  But when the blood and gore are a-flyin', its clumsiness is exacerbated.Say you're a Cleric, for example, which often lives or dies by its numerous self-buffs, skills that improve stats in various categories for their duration.  For each of them, you must press and hold the D-pad in the direction of the skill you wish to assign, press the button to which you wish to assign it, then release the button, then release the D-pad, then press the button to actually cast it.  Then you get to repeat this process for each buff, all of which start with impossibly short durations, before finally re-re-assigning the button to a more regularly used active skill, like Holy Strike, a ranged spell attack.  Annoying enough when you're not even in combat, but potentially lethal to your character when you are.  (According to its manual,Champions Return to Arms, the sequel, solves this problem by allowing the player to press the Square button in combination with the D-pad to simply trigger a skill at that location, in addition to the assignment model from this game; a vast improvement, but that's another review.)Like any other dungeon crawler, Champions is very loot-oriented, with the rapid cycle of kill something, take its stuff, equip it, and repeat generally making up the entirety of the game.  A storyline of sorts is sprinkled about here and there, but it's really just an excuse to change the backdrop and offer more things to kill, because those things have stuff you can take.  Whenever you're full, you use a gate scroll or one of the portal stones scattered about the landscape to return to the town for that act, sell what you don't want, keep what you do, resupply on health or mana potions, arrows, throwing spears, etc., and then return to the fray.Unfortunately, the encumbrance system which limits how much you can carry (with the exception of quest items, which are uniformly weightless, regardless of how absurd that often is) is unbalanced and half-baked.  The answer is to raise your Strength stat, which directly increases the amount of weight you can carry, and/or to put points into a passive skill that every class shares, which increases the amount you can carry as well.Naturally, this is a pretty useless skill for the Barbarian, which has a combat-based reason to raise Strength, as Strength impacts melee damage output.  On the other hand, this means it's also not really a problem for the Barbarian.  Unfortunately, our poor friend the Wizard has to decide where he wants to be wasteful; with a skill that has no impact on his already pathetic damage, or with a stat that's equally without value in all other regards.Champions does make use of a slotting system, also very reminiscent of Diablo 2, wherein various items that have no purpose on their own can be irrevocably attached to an equippable item, provided it has enough slots to accept them.  These items can raise base stats like Strength or Intelligence, add elemental damage, provide resistance to such damage, etc.  Each comes in five tiers of effectiveness, but there is no mechanism by which lesser types can be cashed in for greater.  There is also curiously no level bar, or any other bar, to using them, although you cannot stack the same type multiple times in the same item.  That is, if you slot a rune into your sword that raises Strength by 45, you cannot put another one into that sword.  You can, however, put one into every single other piece of equipment you have (provided it does not already have a Strength bonus), effectively raising your Strength by over 300 right at level 1.  (For scale, your starting strength is anywhere between about 25 and 50.)There is also no storage area, so if you find something that is for a Cleric but you're a Barbarian, and you think, "I'd like to make a Cleric and use that item," you will need to survive the obstacle course that is Champions' save and load system.  While your current game is indicated with an asterisk in the save and load menu, the rest of the data is almost uniformly worthless.  It tells you to which difficulty the game is set, it tells you the date and time it was saved, and it tells you the area in which it was saved.  No character names or levels, nothing to tell you who's actually in there.  That wouldn't be so bad if the entire save and load system didn't take so long or occasionally crash the system.If you are careful, though, you can work around the lack of a vault by spawning endless copies of mules, characters who serve no purpose other than to store loot.  And since you can load any character into any game at almost any time, regardless of difficulty, you can also make as many copies of that loot as you want.  While this makes for some insanely overpowered items when slotted with infinite copies of socket items, it simultaneously neuters the cool-sounding "unique" items.  Ordinarily, if you couldn't make infinite copies of everything, finding a named chest plate, for example, that has a couple so-so mods and one free slot would be a boon.  However, given the choice between that item, or one with a similar armor value, and three slots, the decision is obvious.The resistances, which can also be acquired on some jewelry, range from the very obvious (fire) to the completely obscure (magic).  But, much like the skill tree, since it's never really clear exactly what resistance does (whether it be reducing your chance to be hit by the damage type, or reducing the amount of damage you suffer from it), and in some cases, it's not even clear with which damage type you're being attacked (unfortunately, "not fire" isn't a category), the advantage of having some is equally murky.And then there's presentation.  Voice actors don't seem to be sure what sort of accent they're affecting, and sadly, however unsurprisingly, a clear gender bias is present throughout.  Leave a female Shadow Knight idle long enough, and she'll let you know that "if you keep looking at me like that, I'll have to charge extra."  Because she's... already charging you to look at her?  You know, like a woman.  Take her into a lava-filled cavern, and the first thought that pops into her head, predictably, is that "this place is hotter and steamier than I am."  But, aren't you also really handy with a sword?  Sure, but who cares about that?  Hot and steamy!I realize this game is now over six years old as I write this, but even today, this remains a real problem with this industry in general.  I understand target markets and all that, and I don't see anything wrong with visually pleasing characters of either gender being used to draw an audience.  At the same time, however, for the gaming industry to muse upon the mysterious, illusive female gamer while simultaneously and needlessly filling the huge majority of games with any sort of violence with such shameless sexism is hypocritical, not to mention lazy and pathetic.  Its degrading to women at large, and insulting to male gamers as well.For the meat of the gameplay itself, there is some faint glimmer of elegance, as upgrading the speed of your weapon by way of a misty globe series socket item will change the pace with which you may use it.  That does not mean, however, that you can get away with just mashing the button as fast as possible, and capitalize on this.  It means instead that you must find the precise rhythm your weapon's speed requires (at the default speed, and each of the five varying tiers of misty globes), and tap the X button accordingly.  If you manage to do so, you will be rewarded with that increased attack rate, which offers potentially significant boosts to your damage.  It's not much, but frankly, in one of the worst dungeon crawlers I've played in years (and that's saying something), it's a welcome relief.  A game that was made bearable almost entirely because I was playing with my girlfriend, as we at turns shook our heads in disbelief at some aspects, and laughed at others, sometimes because we just didn't know what else to do, was elevated somewhat by the discovery of a crude semblance of challenging gameplay.On the other hand, faced with more than two or three enemies at a time, at least in a two-player simultaneous game, the engine chugs, and there is noticeable slowdown.  This of course impacts that timing in a way that isn't quite sporting.  Mind you, it's still painfully easy to slog through the enemies of this game.  Player deaths are few and far between, and owe in equal measure to tactical error, a random itch now and again, and the occasional sudden appearance of absurdly cute little kittens in various unexpected parts of our home, the latter two of which we have found far more interesting.  The discovery that there was actually some challenge to aspire to meet anywhere in the game at all was a godsend.I could go on for hours about everything that's wrong with this game, and cover what's right in just a few short sentences.  But, as I said, I'm generally pretty easy on this kind of game.  Can I kill stuff?  Check.  Can I take its stuff?  Check.  The graphics are as good as anything else on the PS2, so I should be good to go, right?  Well... given the limited selection of dungeon crawlers on PS2... yeah, I guess.
Champions of Norrath: Realms of Everquest grafts the top-down (seen from above) hack 'n' slash action engine ofBaldur's Gate: Dark Allianceonto the names and places that define the world ofEverquest I: The Anniversary Edition.  As evidenced by my reviews ofAlien SyndromeandPhantasy Star Portable, I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to this kind of game.  It has to be pretty awful for me to actually not play it, especially if I have someone to play it with.  My girlfriend decided she'd dive into some game or another with me on the PS2, so we'd be playing together on one screen, sitting together on the couch, nice fire going in the fireplace, and so on.  I happily dug out this dungeon crawler that I'd gotten some time ago, but never played.If you want only to know if Champions manages to deliver on the very most basic elements of this kind of game, then you can stop right here, because this will take awhile.  The answer is "yes," it generally lets you do what a dungeon crawler should.  You have a few different classes, you have a few different locales, you can kill things and take their stuff, and you can keep on doing that for hours, as the game offers three successive difficulty levels, each making the same story progressively tougher for higher level ranges.  It supports up to four players locally with multitap, and has a client/server network mode that is probably based on a server that is no longer running.A few basic archetypes common to this sort of game define the classes; healer, tank, ranged DPS (damage-per-second), and magic DPS, as well as a hybrid melee/magic class.  However, though they hit all the right notes in concept, execution is sloppy, to be polite.  The tank class, while quite hardy, has no real tools for managing aggro (who the enemy non-player characters are attacking), which means that the healer isn't really free to heal, since they're defending themselves instead of relying upon the tank.  The magic DPS class doesn't really do much damage, considering all of the drawbacks it has with such a narrow focus.There's nothing inherently wrong with this sort of gameplay, but it's frustrating to see familiar terms and trappings, sit down to play, and discover that there's really nothing like what was described in the manual, insofar as gameplay, anywhere in the actual game.  It's not really a cooperative multiplayer dungeon crawler so much as it is a simultaneous overlapping single player dungeon crawler.Champions makes use of a pre-patchDiablo 2-style skill tree for each of five classes.  When I say pre-patch, I refer to the fact that when Diablo 2 first released, one of the chief complaints players had against it was that early skills in any given skill tree often felt like they served no purpose other than gating access to higher-level, and presumably better, skills later in the tree.  Towards the end of the game's life, later patches included an update that made earlier skills improve upon later ones in the same line of the tree, such that "maxing" those skills, or raising them as high as the game allowed, wasn't necessarily a waste of points, since it improved the function of a descendant.No such luck in Champions, as we get skills that not only have no impact on later skills in a tree beyond gating access to them, but skills that often seem as though they're only in a certain part of the tree because there wasn't any better place to put them.  With a little digging online, you can find out what each skill does for each class at each level (some classes share a skill, but with different levels of effectiveness by level for each).  However, the game itself has almost nothing to offer in that regard, as it only ever tells you what the current skill level does, and the next level, if it exists.  There is also a surprising lack of skill-boosting gear in the game, at least so far as we've played it.Combined with the all-sales-are-final approach to skill point management, the game progressively feels more and more punishing, as any skill point regret you may suffer can only be assuaged by starting over and being more miserly.  Not only do you have no real good idea how any given skill grows to its maximum level of 20, such as when it hits a point where you would personally consider it to be offering diminishing returns, but if you decide to really commit and dump a bunch of points in, only to discover you wish you hadn't, well.  Too bad.In action, skills are assigned by means of an eight-way radial menu, managed with the D-pad, in concert with either the Triangle or Circle buttons.  This menu can be arranged from the character sheet, and used while playing, without pausing, to assign skills to either button.  When the action ebbs, it's a passable enough system, which manages to pack a whole lot of skills into two teeny, tiny buttons.  But when the blood and gore are a-flyin', its clumsiness is exacerbated.Say you're a Cleric, for example, which often lives or dies by its numerous self-buffs, skills that improve stats in various categories for their duration.  For each of them, you must press and hold the D-pad in the direction of the skill you wish to assign, press the button to which you wish to assign it, then release the button, then release the D-pad, then press the button to actually cast it.  Then you get to repeat this process for each buff, all of which start with impossibly short durations, before finally re-re-assigning the button to a more regularly used active skill, like Holy Strike, a ranged spell attack.  Annoying enough when you're not even in combat, but potentially lethal to your character when you are.  (According to its manual,Champions Return to Arms, the sequel, solves this problem by allowing the player to press the Square button in combination with the D-pad to simply trigger a skill at that location, in addition to the assignment model from this game; a vast improvement, but that's another review.)Like any other dungeon crawler, Champions is very loot-oriented, with the rapid cycle of kill something, take its stuff, equip it, and repeat generally making up the entirety of the game.  A storyline of sorts is sprinkled about here and there, but it's really just an excuse to change the backdrop and offer more things to kill, because those things have stuff you can take.  Whenever you're full, you use a gate scroll or one of the portal stones scattered about the landscape to return to the town for that act, sell what you don't want, keep what you do, resupply on health or mana potions, arrows, throwing spears, etc., and then return to the fray.Unfortunately, the encumbrance system which limits how much you can carry (with the exception of quest items, which are uniformly weightless, regardless of how absurd that often is) is unbalanced and half-baked.  The answer is to raise your Strength stat, which directly increases the amount of weight you can carry, and/or to put points into a passive skill that every class shares, which increases the amount you can carry as well.Naturally, this is a pretty useless skill for the Barbarian, which has a combat-based reason to raise Strength, as Strength impacts melee damage output.  On the other hand, this means it's also not really a problem for the Barbarian.  Unfortunately, our poor friend the Wizard has to decide where he wants to be wasteful; with a skill that has no impact on his already pathetic damage, or with a stat that's equally without value in all other regards.Champions does make use of a slotting system, also very reminiscent of Diablo 2, wherein various items that have no purpose on their own can be irrevocably attached to an equippable item, provided it has enough slots to accept them.  These items can raise base stats like Strength or Intelligence, add elemental damage, provide resistance to such damage, etc.  Each comes in five tiers of effectiveness, but there is no mechanism by which lesser types can be cashed in for greater.  There is also curiously no level bar, or any other bar, to using them, although you cannot stack the same type multiple times in the same item.  That is, if you slot a rune into your sword that raises Strength by 45, you cannot put another one into that sword.  You can, however, put one into every single other piece of equipment you have (provided it does not already have a Strength bonus), effectively raising your Strength by over 300 right at level 1.  (For scale, your starting strength is anywhere between about 25 and 50.)There is also no storage area, so if you find something that is for a Cleric but you're a Barbarian, and you think, "I'd like to make a Cleric and use that item," you will need to survive the obstacle course that is Champions' save and load system.  While your current game is indicated with an asterisk in the save and load menu, the rest of the data is almost uniformly worthless.  It tells you to which difficulty the game is set, it tells you the date and time it was saved, and it tells you the area in which it was saved.  No character names or levels, nothing to tell you who's actually in there.  That wouldn't be so bad if the entire save and load system didn't take so long or occasionally crash the system.If you are careful, though, you can work around the lack of a vault by spawning endless copies of mules, characters who serve no purpose other than to store loot.  And since you can load any character into any game at almost any time, regardless of difficulty, you can also make as many copies of that loot as you want.  While this makes for some insanely overpowered items when slotted with infinite copies of socket items, it simultaneously neuters the cool-sounding "unique" items.  Ordinarily, if you couldn't make infinite copies of everything, finding a named chest plate, for example, that has a couple so-so mods and one free slot would be a boon.  However, given the choice between that item, or one with a similar armor value, and three slots, the decision is obvious.The resistances, which can also be acquired on some jewelry, range from the very obvious (fire) to the completely obscure (magic).  But, much like the skill tree, since it's never really clear exactly what resistance does (whether it be reducing your chance to be hit by the damage type, or reducing the amount of damage you suffer from it), and in some cases, it's not even clear with which damage type you're being attacked (unfortunately, "not fire" isn't a category), the advantage of having some is equally murky.And then there's presentation.

"I will stop you to go forward" the portal watcher of Ulara said to me, the main protagonist.  Of course what she meant was "I won't let you pass."Above is just one hilarious example of the terrible dialogue in this game.  The dialogue is consistently this bad throughout the entire game, demeaning the characters, story, and entire game to amateur level.Dungeons are the heart of this game's gameplay, which are long and tedious.  Same areas are used in different locations with at least one battle in each area.  The numerous battles and repetitious dungeons make the gameplay incredibly slow and dry.Supposedly this game is well known for its cool battle quirks.  This is true, almost everything you do in a battle is effected in some way by player performance.  However I did not find this to be enjoyable.  After hundreds of battles I was pleading for the game to automate my attacks.  Repetition of button-timing and button-mashing mini games during battles became tiresome extremely fast.Soundtrack was quite nice though, paralleling Final Fantasy series quality.  This however doesn't make up for the rest of this mess.With poor story and gameplay, this game is not something I enjoyed playing.

I own every EA FIFA World Cup title since World Cup '98 and have looked forward to the EA Games quadrennial release ever since. I purchased 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil right in the middle of the actual World Cup and unfortunately so far I am severely disappointed with the product EA has released.--------------------GAMEPLAY & GRAPHICS:Before I get into that though, you should know a few more things about this game. If you've played FIFA 2014 then you'll likely be very familiar with 2014 World Cup. This game borrows all major gameplay elements directly from FIFA 2014. Personally I really enjoyed FIFA 2014 though based on many reviews I've read that titles reception was quite mixed.The major element of change for 2014 World Cup is of course the venue and the emphasis on national teams over club teams. EA has always done a good job with capturing the spirit of the world cup and the spectacle that surrounds each game. That remains intact in 2014 FIFA World Cup. Each game features a full introduction as you'd expect in a real World Cup game - including the players marching out onto the field, the playing of national anthems, etc. Big games (and the final) feature team and player celebrations, fireworks, confetti and all the celebratory aspects surrounding the biggest spectacle in sports. All is well in this regard of the game.Many reviews have commented on how much more difficult 2014 World Cup is than the standard FIFA 2014 game. I think that there is definitely a higher degree of difficulty but it's not too bad. I play both games on the "Professional" setting and I've been able to adapt quite well to 2014 World Cup's extra bit of difficulty. I've written off the spike in difficulty as just a matter of course - you are after all supposed to be playing at the highest level soccer has to offer.Graphics are a considerable improvement over the last World Cup game (2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa) and again are taken almost directly from FIFA 2014. That's not a bad thing at all as the graphics are actually quite nice. Player models move quite well and look very close to their real-world counterparts. The extra sheen of celebration and the bright colors of the Brazilian theme add a welcome addition to FIFA 2014's somewhat toned-down look.--------------------THE PROBLEMS:My main issue with this game are the myriad of problems that it shipped with and to this day haven't been addressed. EA has taken a lot of flak from gamers and to be honest it's easy to see why.The first problem I noticed shortly after starting my first World Cup (at the group stage). I was prompted by the game to make my 23-man roster and noticed some strange problems. The first issue is that some players aren't selectable. Meaning that you can't rotate them out of your team for another player in the reserves. This is apparently totally random as I've tried many different times with different teams using a different save file. That really won't matter though because even the players who you can rotate will ultimately be changed by the game after making your selections. For example after swapping in a few key players in my Spanish team I saved and moved onto my first match against the Netherlands and immediately noticed huge gaps in my team. No Iniesta, Villa, Silva (even though they were clearly listed in my 23-man roster) and in their place were players that I didn't call up. Again, I've tested and confirmed this exact issue with different teams using different save files.More problems are located with the online element. Connecting is the biggest hurdle as EAs servers seem to be frequently offline. When you do get on matches are pretty inconsistent. Some matches seem to go well while others are a lagging mess or worse simply disconnect.After buying the game I jumped on EA's forum to see if there was a fix or if I was doing anything wrong and stumbled onto a forum full of people having the exact same issues. These issues have been reported since the launch of the title and are still not fixed (going on 3 full months) with the end of the World Cup looming in a few days as writing this review.--------------------CONCLUSION:EA does it again! They ship a game to meet a deadline instead of shipping a quality product. The game is broken and major elements are totally unusable. This company deserves the hate it gets. Do yourself a favor and confirm that these issues are fixed prior to buying this game or skip it altogether. Not recommended!
You know, pirates are all about sailing the seven seas, scourging and plundering mercilessly to retrieve your loot and stab your trusted officers in the back when orders are not fufilled. But Pirates: The Legened of Black Kat is anything but what you thought a pirate game should be.First off, the only real highlight of this game is being the captian of many ships and buying repair and weapon items. But even sailing them and doing sea battles is not that challenging and not that fun.You can also dock on many islands and many worlds as Katrina de' Leon, but even that is exceptionly bad. She does not have many moves or abilityes and heck, she can't even climb up the smallest hills!Graphics on this game are very poor, and all of the villians and chest items you retrive look horrible. The only good graphics of the game are the waters of the oceans you sail which look very real.The music is alright...when it decides to turn itself on. One of this games' many flaws is that it gives you no motivation to keep "adventuring" while you play and you don't feel like you ever want to plug it in after your done playing!However, there are little aspects of this game that seem interesting but not enough to keep you from being bored, such as Tiki Heads which give you different attacks, and magical figureheads on your ship to give it powers out of the ordinary. Yet even these items do very little to keep you wanting to play.Mostly, I kept wanting to see more variety of gameplay and challenges, as it quickly got repetitive, and the puzzles on this game are quick to solve.All in all, if you like horrible, poorly desighned laking gameplay in a video game, I sugest that you don't even glance at this game next time you come across it.It just plain is'nt worth it.

What they produce it's not soccer!!!, I bought fifa 2004 just for the online play, (another disappointment the online gameplay) but just like others fifa's games, a complete dissapoint. It's seems like your game it's a merge of soccer and NFL, NOT soccer at all. Everyone who played real soccer... at least once in it's life, could tell you that fifa series it's not soccer, or it's what EA team think soccer it's.. or should be, but not way of play. Fifa have good grafics, but you don't feel the emotion of the soccer seen graphics, soccer it's passion, not graphics and tactics of NFL games. I won't purchase any fifa game ever!. See what Winning eleven 6 or 7 does, or Word tour soccer 2005 does whith the gameplay.

Get back to the basics and allow a 30 rank Heavywieght league maby 34 so 4 other people can be on at the same time, and if they wanna pass you there gonna have to beat yah. and 4.

I was very excited to try this game... The reality is that this game is sick.  What kind of a reflection on our society is it that we produce a game which glorifies beating old people with bats, running over cops, and shooting cops.  I am not against violence per se, because we have all grown up playing cowboys and Indians, or cops and robbers, pretending to have guns and shooting each other.  That has been going on since time immemorial, ever since it was cave dweller vs. bear.  Many games involve shooting or death, but usually you are on some kind of quest to save the world.  In this game, you are glorified for senseless acts of cruelty.  I do not find this amusing or even "funny."  After playing for a few hours, I felt dirty, as though I were committing evil.  If you pretend to ...[commit crimes], that is not a good thing.

This game is psychotic and for people with serious issues. I would hate to meet the disturbed minds that came up with it.

boring,  Traded it in after 1 hour.
simply cannot be read. returned
looks gorgous, boring shooter.
I, too, was excited about Spore until I heard about the DRM. That's a dealbreaker.
A Bad game that appears to be a great one..
I don't get the love for this game.  "Lame" is what they should call it.

Dis is worse hokey game i play. It has too many glitch online and tio much lags. The new fghts are glad but thas its. If you save 11 or 12 or 13 jus playred those. They are the better nlh games fir da fact. Oh and i almos forgots that they fugged up the scedules rosters and jerzies too. Ea blows these days fore sure. So do bot by it. You will waste yours money.
