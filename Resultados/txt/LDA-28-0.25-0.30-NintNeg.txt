Nintendo has taken one of the greatest racing games for SNES and revamped it into a whole different futuristic racing game. For starters, there are 30 racers rather than 4, and this game is very fast! But to be so fast and have 30 racers, the game is very cheaply detailed. Lets just say the car your driving is very small and looks like a box with rocket boosters. Also with 30 cars 6 cars to start and 24 to earn, it gets a bit confusing as to who you should chose to race as, so there are detailed photos of each driver so that people can pick their favorite to drive as. The originality of the game is the fact that the track forms itself into any sort of shape. It goes into huge anti-gravity loops, half pipes where you can drive on the ceiling, and pipes where you can race on the outside of it... all around it... without falling off! There are three levels of difficulty, customizable colors, cars, speeds, acceleration and three circuits with seven or so unique tracks. Finally there is an original battle mode, where you must destroy other racers by knocking them off the track. This is a game you should rent before you buy.

This is the third official version of F-Zero. There are hacks claiming to be F-Zero 2, but there are only three games in the series, F-Zero (SNES), F-Zero X (N64), & F-Zero: Maximum Velocity (GBA). F-Zero is a relatively simple concept... it is all about a space race. Each vehicle is equipped with a jet propulsion system and magnetic stabilizers. You race down the tracks at speeds exceeding 600mph. Racers from all over the galaxy come to compete. Once you are on the track, anything goes. Other racers can even push you off the track and to your death.I was rather pleased with the feel of the game. The whirr of the engines was well done for this limited audio power on the GBA.  Collision SFX did lack in the sense that they sounded more like someone sneezing.  The cityscape presented on the  earlier tracks was well preserved from the SNES version. The vehicles have a new take on appearance. These are nicely rendered in 3D when you select your machine, however in game racing uses a very dulled down version of the CG models featured in the vehicle select screen.  The track does spin nicely and appears to have slight usage of a 3D engine.I was disappointed with the actual control of the game. Racing is very difficult to control. It seems the slightest tap will send you ricocheting from wall to wall. This became increasingly annoying when I was trying to place. The recharge ports are also too small to really regain any energy. By the time you are finished being bounced around on the track, you have already passed your chance to recharge. There is definitely a high learning curve in this out of control world.I did not like the game. I enjoyed the first two F-Zero games, F-Zero X more than the original. F-Zero: Maximum Velocity just seems to take more time to learn than I am really willing to put forward. I do not recommend this to newbies of the series. If you have played previous installments, you may find value here, but as for myself, once tossed around, twice shy.

Remember Shining Force I and II? Remember? Those turn based top-down view rpgs on the Sega Mega Drive with cool characters, heaps of cool magic and detailed combat animations?Well those were classic sega games that came out a full DECADE ago. Compared to those strategy rpgs of yore, Fire Emblem (this the 7th in the series) makes NO PROGRESS WHATSOEVER.It has lacklustre character designs, an overly wordy plot, a simplistic and boring combat system, a lack of difficulty and an annoying "support" feature which is somehow the developers attempt at adding replay value to this game.Overall, to the utter newbie whose only prior experience with these kind of games was with Advance Wars(which is arguably a better game than this one), Fire Emblem might seem like a solid choice. I agree, it IS a solid choice. It is also, however, a throwback of a game. A disappointing retread of gameplay that has been done bigger and better(on lower end systems I might add).How to begin? I will make a short comparison between this game and Shining Force II, which many of you have already played. Let me remind you that:*SFII had more exciting animations. In Fire Emblem, most of the art went to the character portraits. When it comes to the top-down graphics in battle, as well as the battle animations themselves, this game looks extremely poor for a GBA game.*SFII had more varied character designs.  FE's characters might look "pretty", but are pretty much all same-ish anime fare, color-coded hair and all.*SFII had HEAPS more: weapons, armours, spells, items. It was much more varied. Compared to this, all FE has going for it is a nice little "weapon triangle" system and your token herbs and potions. Not very exciting. In SFII you could cast spells like gigantic lightning storms which affect entire areas. In FE the magic works just like a weapon. You attack one square at a time. BO-Ring.*SFII had BETWEEN-COMBAT exploration. In FE, it's pretty much battle after battle. Consequently the plot is FORCED to be told in huge CHUNKS pre and post-battle. Not very immersive.*SFII was fun and worth replaying. Just go try it. In FE however, any semblance of replayability is in the form of placing different units next to each other and wait turn after turn in hope of getting new support combos. Wheee.It seems abit ridiculous for me to compare this hand-held game with a console game, but bear in mind that the console game in question came out more than 10 years before this. The game boy advance is both graphically and performance wise better than the Mega Drive in every respect. Why can't Intelligent Sys. make a game that fully utilises its potential?

The incessant jumping and being knocked down everytime by flying bats is enough to drive even the most mild mannered of gamers stark raving mad.  Do not buy if you want a casual waste of time only buy if you are hardcore and enjoy challenges that are near impossible.

We did not like this version as much as some of the older Mario parties.

I am no Nintendo hater. Quite the contrary in fact, and when it comes to the Paper Mario series, I have always been a massive fan, whether it's theoriginal, classic Paper Mario,its utterly amazing sequel, The Thousand-Year Door, or the more platformer-centricSuper Paper Mario, I love me some Paper Mario games. I can't tell you how excited I was when Sticker Star was announced. I bought my 3DS way back when highly anticipating this game, and even though it went through several delays, I waited patiently. All through development, this was promised to be an entry that would take Paper Mario back to its RPG roots, in every sense, and I couldn't have been more psyched. The first two or three hours in, I really enjoyed my time with Sticker Star. It was a blast and the undeniable Paper Mario charm was off the charts. Then, I started to notice some glaring issues, and they became more glaring with each passing moment until I realized something painful, I don't really like this game all that much. Please, put down your torches and pitchforks and let me explain (and I want to be fair to the game and to you, the readers, so this may be a long, detailed review, I'm warning you right now)...First off, there's a reason why I was hooked for the first two or three hours. There are a lot of positives in this game's favor. Here are the biggest ones:- The Presentation. The visuals are spectacular, possibly the best the series has ever had, in fact. The whole "children's pop-up book" aesthetic of the Paper Mario series has always been one of its biggest strengths. Not only is it cute, but it somehow pulls off being simultaneously nostalgic and fresh to the extreme, and it's done really well here. Many familiar locales from Mario's history, most notably from thethe New Super Mario Bros series, get their chance to shine, and shine they do. The nostalgia and familiarity is really endearing and some new twists on familiar oldies, like a Mariachi Shy Guy band, or a Yoshi sphinx, are fantastic. There's also something awesome about 2-D, flat paper characters and settings rendered in true 3-D on the 3DS. It's like playing a child's school project diorama come to life. Great job here! And then there's the soundtrack. Oh the soundtrack! The music in this game really blew me away, and on occasion merits putting down the system just to soak it in for a while. Much of it feels like they told a Jazz band to just go nuts with familiar Mario motifs and themes, and it's awesome. Plenty of sax and trumpet to go around. Sweet stuff. Don't even get me started on how sweet the Mariachi Shy Guy band music is.- Stickers, stickers, stickers. Everything revolves around stickers. Yes, everything. The battle system is entirely sticker based, and oftentimes you need certain stickers to solve puzzles in the various levels you visit. Maybe you need to put a mere normal sticker in the environment to open a door. Or maybe you need a special "thing" sticker that comes to life and affects the environment in big and surprising ways. There's lots of clever puzzles throughout the whole game. I found the whole "sticker" theme to be a refreshing twist on the classical Paper Mario formula, or at least I found the concept to be great anyway.- The Battle System (more on this in the bad section later). In an attempt to return to Paper Mario's RPG roots, Intelligent systems made the battle system a turn-based affair once again. To fight a sense of "been here, done that," they decided to make the battle system revolve around stickers. This means two things. 1.) The entire battle system is, for all intents and purposes, entirely item based (or sticker inventory based, if you will), and 2.) There's a system of strategy that involves proper button inputs to increase the effectiveness of whichever sticker command you choose. This gives the battles a great sense of risk vs. reward as you wonder, "Can I use this less powerful 'worn-out hammer' perfectly and finish the battle that way? Or should I pull out my more powerful 'flashy hammer' sticker and guarantee a victory?" This is really cool.This all sounds awesome, doesn't it? Well, yes, that's because it is. It's a unique twist that at least starts to bring the series back to its RPG roots. There are a few HUGE problems, however, that really pull the rest of the game down. I'll try to explain them now:- The story. There is no story, really. Yeah, at the beginning, Bowser grabs a giant, mythical royal sticker he's not supposed to, and because of that sticker's power, he himself becomes a super powerful, shiny sticker. He gives each fragment of the original royal sticker to five of his henchmen across the land, and it's up to Mario to go to each area, traverse their levels, and get each crown sticker back. After this introduction to the story, there's nothing more. No more plot, no more interesting characters, no real developments. It's bizarre, because the game actually feels like a traditional Mario platformer in terms of its story, in that, there is virtually none. Even the way you get from level to level is like a Mario platformer: an overworld map in a "level 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, etc." sort of way. Again, it's more akin toNew Super Mario Bros. Each level itself is styled in the way the original Paper Mario was, but there's no big world to explore, no big, interesting towns to visit, no companions to meet and take along with you, nothing. There's only one companion, a floating crown sticker named Kersti who is basically Mario's very ownNavi, but not nearly as charming or likable. Even Super Paper Mario, which was basically a platformer at heart, had way more plot and characters than this. What happened? There's no incentive to keep going, as far as plot is concerned. Again, in a Mario platformer, that's not a problem, but this isn't a platformer! It's *supposed* to be more of an RPG, and in an RPG, plot is kinda important.- The Battle System. Now wait a minute, didn't I say this was a positive? Well, yeah, the battle system itself is fantastic, except for one MASSIVE problem: It's all meaningless! After playing for an hour or two, I noticed something; there's no place in the menu to see Mario's stats, or his level, or his equipment... there's only sticker inventory. Wait, does that mean there's NO experience points (or Star Points, to be accurate) or leveling up in this game? Yep, there are *zero* tangible benefits to battles. The ONLY reward for winning battles are coins and stickers. Stickers are *everywhere* in the world as you explore, so this battle reward is meaningless. Coins are also everywhere in the levels, and their only use is for buying more stickers, so again, meaningless. The battles that are otherwise brilliantly conceived are rendered a waste of your time by no meaningful, tangible rewards for your efforts. There's no sense of progression in Mario's character, whatsoever. It makes more sense to just avoid enemies on the map altogether (who always respawn when you go back to already conquered areas, by the way, and since backtracking is a big part of this game at times, this is troublesome and annoying). Coming from Thousand-Year Door, where I actually sought out battles as much as I could due to their one-two punch of awesome design and satisfaction from winning, this is a *massive* gaffe. I mean, it's unforgivable really. Imagine truly great RPGs, ones likeFinal Fantasy IV(or VI, VII, and IX, take your pick, they're all amazing),Chrono Trigger,Earthbound,Radiant Historia, Super Mario RPG, the Mario and Luigi rpg series, or the first two Paper Mario titles, and imagine them without experience points, new, better equipment to find/aquire, or a leveling system. Blasphemy! If this wasn't trying to be an RPG, it wouldn't be so bad, but everything else in the game hearkens back to the RPG Paper Mario titles. *Sigh*- Perhaps the WORST thing about the game is its lost potential. When Intelligent Systems started work on this game, they wanted to make it a true sequel to 1,000-Year Door. They had a big, epic plot planned out. There was going to be a charming overworld filled with exciting places to explore and characters to meet. There would be several unique, lovable companions to join you on your quest. The theater turn-based battles with audiences would come back. All throughout the process, however, Shigeru Miyamoto rejected all of these ideas until this game became the finished product. I love you Miyamoto-San, but what the H-E-doublehockeysticks were you thinking!? If Intelligent Systems' original vision for this game had been allowed to come to fruition, I have no doubt whatsoever that this would have been a 5-star masterpiece. Look at their track record for a moment: all Paper Mario games up until this one, the Fire Emblem series, the Advance Wars series, the WarioWare series, Pushmo, Crashmo, and the list goes on. These guys are masters of their craft, and this would have been another masterpiece to add to that list, if only Uncle Shiggy hadn't gotten in the way (I love the guy, he's a true inspiration to gamers everywhere, but this is a blemish on his otherwise astronomically great record). What would have been a masterpiece has been turned into a game that is merely "OK," and that is the most painful thing of all about this game: The lost potential.I am not an overly critical person. I think this is my second or third 2-star review in total. I'd much rather review games I love or at least really like, not ones I think are just "meh" or "OK." I *really* wanted to love this game, but given the massive loss of potential, and the real botching of some of the most crucial aspects of the game that would have justified the change in direction, I just can't. I really tried with this game, but in the end, I just couldn't shake the growing feeling of disappointment and boredom anymore. Super Paper Mario really changed up the traditional formula, sure, but it was still a wonderfully executed game that was great on its own. Sticker Star could have been a nice spin-off Paper Mario title like that one was if there was even a slightly better plot to break the monotony, a battle system that actually feels rewarding, and a sense of satisfaction and progress for Mario's character throughout the game, but it just isn't there. Maybe others will find more enjoyment in this game. The game has some real strength in its presentation and many of the core concepts are sound, but it just isn't for me. I'm sorry Intelligent Systems, I'm sorry fellow Paper Mario fans, and most painfully, I'm sorry Paper Mario, but I just don't like Paper Mario: Sticker Star. Thanks for reading my review and hearing me out. You can go ahead and get out your pitchforks now.
Metroid has got to be my favorite series of all time:  non-linear exploration, epic battles, and superbly entertaining weapons and power-ups which you get both by following the story line and by NOT following it at all.  No matter what you did, you were either going to be entertained by challenging fights, challenging puzzles, or just the sheer joy of exploration.  You were always alone, but it was alright--Samus just seemed so unflinching.Those days are gone, possibly for good if Nintendo allows for the next Metroid game (if there will be one) to follow this one's design.  You aren't allowed to explore at will anymore, the storyline is bent out of shape, the controls are annoying, the voice acting is bad, and Samus is unrealistically vulnerable as a character.On the Metroid timeline this story falls right after Super Metroid--Zebes is destroyed, along with the last Space Pirate stronghold, not to mention the last Metroids.  After so many years of fighting the Pirates Samus is seemingly left without a cause and begins to resume her old life as a bounty hunter when she picks up a distress signal coming from a remote space station; she decides to investigate and finds that the station she lands on is teeming with dangerous life forms, and the only other humans are a small squad of Federation soldiers.  But not just any soldiers, because two of them used to fight with Samus when she was part of the Army:  Anthony Higgins and Adam Malkovich.  Malkovich was her commanding officer, and this is the precept for just about every cinematic sequence of the game.Unfortunately, this is also the first problem with the game.  Of the time spent playing your are going to have several hours of mandatory, non-skippable cinemas.  So instead of providing you with a game which has in depth gameplay AND an in depth cinematic, you have to watch movie after movie after movie.  The point of this game comes off as being more about Samus's relationship with her previous teammates than the current investigation of the death of almost every human aboard the space station.This doesn't sound too terribly bad, to be honest, because Samus is a character who has been shrouded in mystery pretty much since day one.  It's only natural that we would want to get to know her a little more personally, but unfortunately this ruins the dynamic of a Metroid style game because if you have to pursue the storyline as the movies dictate the joy of exploration just isn't there.  You're meant to find everything you find, to get every power-up you get; your effort (the player's effort) is actually quite minimal.  There's no element of puzzle-solving at all in this game, which is another major departure from the rest of the series.  If you see a door that you can't yet open (because you don't have the right power-up) you aren't allowed to backtrack to open it up after you do have the right power-up unless that area is where the story requires you to be.  And I mean it when I say that you aren't allowed to backtrack--certain doors will be locked (even if you've been through them before) depending on where you are in the story and will not open again until much later.  The designers of the game talked about 'the joy of discovery' in this game; ironically you aren't allowed to discover anything they don't want you to discover.As mentioned, this rigid gameplay is linked to the story, which as a story only sort-of works.  Yes, it's good to get a deeper glimpse of Samus's past, but to make the game focus almost entirely on the past makes things a little less enjoyable.  Especially when you consider that as story lines get more and more complex, and that the tradition in Metroid is to start out with nothing and build your way up, you need an explanation for why Samus doesn't have her full range of gear at the start.  In this game you are denied use of your gear in the beginning on grounds that you are working with other troops and that stray fire from your much more powerful weapons could kill someone; if you need something more intense Malkovich (being the CO) will authorize it.  Sounds logical, until you consider that there are items in Samus's arsenal that wouldn't hurt anyone.  Like the Varia Suit, for example; all it does is reduce damage from enemies and protect Samus from temperature extremes.  Yet there is a part in the game where you have to run through a super-heated area, taking damage from both the heat and the enemies all at the same time, while Malkovich refuses to let you turn on your Varia suit feature.  You're getting cooked to death, which Malkovich knows, but he refuses to let you save yourself.  The same thing goes for the Gravity Suit and the Space Jump--both are perfectly harmless, but you're not allowed to use them because Malkovich says no.  (This in itself is also a huge departure and very un-Samus-like, as Samus usually just does whatever she wants.)  And to make the irony complete, you spend most of your time alone.  No other soldiers to endanger nearby...  Lots of large and dangerous creatures everywhere...  But still no plasma beam...The controls were (largely) designed to work like the classic SNES controls as this game takes a third person perspective.  You hold the remote horizontally and use the d-pad and a couple of buttons for the majority of the game.  But, the game producers forgot that the gaming world is largely in 3D now so a little directional pad with only four directions doesn't quite let you do everything you need to do.  Like walking diagonally, for example.  Or dodging enemies.  To be fair, the designers tried to introduce a Matrix-style dodging technique complete with special killing blows, all of which sounds cool and sounds classic considering how Samus would always be doing multiple flips in mid-air and jumping off walls in the older 2-D games.  But in this game the Matrix-style moves are not an option, they are a requirement.  Some enemies take a very long time to kill without these killing blows, and because this is a 3D game every time you try to dodge you are going to be facing the wrong direction.  This is because the dodging is all done on the D-Pad which is also how you move and change direction.  That's right, you have to press the D-Pad in the right direction at the right moment to dodge because walking won't get you out of the line of fire fast enough.  You can still change directions during these dodges, which means that if you do so unintentionally (very easy with a d-pad) you will not be facing your enemy, a big problem if you intend on actually killing your enemy quickly.  Don't rely on the auto-targeting either; because the game is 3D with 2D controls the designers included an auto-aim feature, which doesn't always do the logical thing (target the closest enemy you are facing).  You'll be doing more dodging than you really want to.  What's worse, there is no control to allow you to center the camera behind Samus--you will be ambushed because of that and you will take a lot of damage because of that ambushing.To be brief about the voice acting, the narrations are bland and the lines for the cutscenes are not at all what you would expect from a bounty hunter who has just spent the past few years helping the war effort, and had spent many years before that on her own as a bounty hunter.  You would expect Samus to be blunt, terse or maybe even rude.  Instead she is quiet and unnaturally polite, not to mention verbose.  Not what you would expect from someone whose CO basically let her burn on the station rather than turn on her temperature protection suit...Which brings us to Samus as a character.  As mentioned we would expect Samus to be tough and more than willing to bend the rules if she thinks she needs to because that' what she did in almost every other game.  But for the duration of the game, Samus just does whatever Malkovich asks; most of the cinemas (remember that they are usually 20 minutes or longer, and you can't skip) become soap operas of Samus's past.  Samus is depicted as being sensitive in this game, which is normal for a human being but her sensitivity is so extreme that it gets in the way--literally.  At one point she confronts Ridley and goes into a panic attack that prevents her from fighting.  But any Metroid fan will remember that by this point in the Metroid timeline Samus has fought Ridley a grand total of five (5) times without panicking in the slightest...  Why this time, I don't know.  It makes no sense, and the warrior who has always managed to conquer her fears in the face of death suddenly can't fight back...  I'm sorry, but the designers destroyed Samus as a character.  To be emotional is normal, but if you can be reduced to a crying, blubbering mass instantly odds are you aren't a bounty hunter who has just spent the past few years in the middle of a war.Samus is also unrealistic physically, which of course leads to sexploitation.  Everyone who has ever seen gameplay scenes from a Metroid game would have to admit that Samus is extremely athletic, almost gymnastically so.  In this game, however, there are numerous cutscenes of Samus in her Zero-Suit (so form fitting that it might as well be called a birthday suit) and you can tell she's very well... endowed around the waist and the bosom.  Compare that to a real athletic woman (especially a gymnast) and you will know that something is wrong; there is no justification for her physical design as a character, and you have to ask yourself why the programmers designed her this way.  Considering her figure and just how tight her suit I am tempted to say her design borders on the pornographic.  I would definitely urge parents to think twice before letting their children play this game.  Samus is not a warrior in this game, she's a pin-up girl.In many ways Samus is the game, and in this game she just is not believable.  She's not the tough, independent character we expect given her circumstances and personal history, she's a submissive quasi-crybaby.  Furthermore, giving her long monologues and cutscenes was a big risk on the part of the game designers, one that did not pay off; they not only damaged her character but damaged the genre altogether.  Keeping Samus quiet in the other titles let you feel involved; you didn't just control Samus, you were Samus.  That was why Metroid was always so much fun.  But in this game, you're not Samus anymore.  Instead you're just watching her, usually in cutscenes that go on and on.  There isn't much fun in cutscenes, which is why most serious gamers skip each and every one.
Lately, the word Nintendo has almost become synonymous with thinking outside of the box.  First they released Wii Sports to the glee of consumers, which played a major role in increasing the size of the casual market.  Next came Wii Fit, which also sold like hotcakes despite having a ninety dollar price tag.  These unique gameplay concepts appealed to people, because they could partake in non-strenuous physical activity in the comfort of their home.  Pick up and play games have become increasingly popular, and Wii Music has been designed in the same mold.  Unlike the previous two games however, Wii Music fails to deliver an experience that will captivate most consumers.  The marketing behind Wii Music will likely trick your average consumer, but the gameplay behind it will probably disappoint most people once they get their hands on it.  Swinging a racket in Wii Tennis was a lot of fun, because it felt similar to the real thing without being overly complex, but Wii Music's gameplay feels as if it were made for those not yet ready to enter grade school, even though it is an experience made for everyone.Admittedly, the concept behind Wii Music is a good one--the game claims to have 60 playable instruments, but in reality, that isn't entirely true.  While there are 60 instruments, there are only four control methods, so you are basically playing the same four instruments the entire game.  Sure, they sound slightly different--close to their real life counterparts with a diminished sound quality, but using them feels the same.  One of these control methods has you holding the instrument like a recorder--you hold the instrument close to your face and alternate pressing the 1 and 2 buttons.  You'll do this for most wind and brass instruments included in the game.  The next control method has you playingguitar-like instruments by holding the Wii-nunchuk steady in your left hand, while moving the Wii-mote up and down as if you were strumming a guitar.  Unlike the recorder-like control, this doesn't feel much like the real thing.  The third control method has you playing instruments such as the piano and drums by moving your left and right hands up and down as if you were hitting a drum.  Many of the instruments use this control method, so eventually this gets tiresome.  I often felt like I was a baby throwing a tantrum.  Actually, if I was a baby, I probably would throw one because of the boring, repetitive gameplay.  Finally, the fourth control method has you holding your left hand steady while moving your right hand horizontally and simultaneously pressing the B button.  This movement is meant to simulate moving a bow across the string as you would with a violin or cello.  These four methods are decent during your first thirty minutes playing Wii Music, but they quickly grow old, and don't give you the feeling that you're playing real instruments.Not only are the control methods flawed and unoriginal, but the core gameplay is lacking as well.  Unlike Guitar Hero and Rockband, there aren't scores or ways of capturing how well you play.  In jam sessions, where you can play with up to four people, there are note charts you can look at, which tell you the optimal places to play the notes, but you are also encouraged to use improvisation to give the pieces you play a unique flair.  This is a cool feature, but your pieces will never sound as good as you hope, due to the low quality sound in Wii Music.  It would be nice if the pieces featured CD quality sound, but I suppose that won't be a huge issue to kids just looking to have fun.  Still, the game definitely feels lacking since it doesn't really have a system in place to help you perform the pieces the way they were meant to sound.  Like other reviews have said, Wii Music is really more of a toy than a game.  There aren't many objectives to complete, and the gameplay is extremely simplistic for the most part.Wii Music does have its merits however.  While the song list doesn't feature pieces that are popular today, it features many well known American classics, as well as world music.  I heard many of these songs as a kid, and it was cool to experience them again despite the poor quality audio.  Wii Music contains very little video game music: the Mario theme, Zelda theme, Mute City from F-Zero, and a couple Animal Crossing songs.  Well, it also includes the Wii Sports and Wii Music themes, but to me they just sound like elevator music.  It would have been great if more Nintendo songs were included, but the song list is still a good selection for general audiences for the most part.  Wii Music has many famous songs such as Ode to Joy, Minuet in G Minor, Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star, Yankee Doodle, and The Loco-Motion.  There are also international songs like Frere Jacques and Sakura.  The fifty included songs will keep you busy for awhile, but it is a chore unlocking them.  You have to go through many tedious "training" modes as well as watch many saved videos of your performances in jam sessions.  Even when you unlock all the songs, the repetitive nature of the game will quickly set in due to the lack of gameplay goals.Besides single and multiplayer jam sessions, Wii Music includes a variety of other modes.  If you have a Wii Balance Board, you have the option of engaging in a special drum-training session that utilizes the board.  It is fun to mess around with in  a regular jam session, but the training mode is far too difficult due to the unintuitive nature of the control set-up.  A full drum set includes many parts, so it is understandable that this mode isn't easy, but Nintendo could have made it a little more intuitive.  It is difficult to manage using your feet on the board and waving both arms in a variety of ways, while holding or depressing buttons at the same time.  Some of the motions do drastically different things depending on what button you're holding down, so it all just becomes too much to keep track of.  If you have a board, just mess around with it in jam sessions.  The other modes are less complex and are generally more enjoyable.Handbell Harmony is an entertaining mode that has you using your rhythm skills.  In this mode, your Mii holds two different colored bells at the top of the screen.  On the main section of the screen, you'll find colored bells scrolling by, and when your colored bells enter a bell shape contained in a bar on the center of the screen, you swing your arm that is holding that color.  In this mode, you are graded on how well you do, so it is fun challenging yourself to see if you can get the correct timing when the mode is set at high tempo.Pitch Perfect is another fun mode, but it is more in lines with music education than actual playing.  For those who have perfect pitch or have played an instrument in the past, you'll probably find this mode fairly easy.  I managed to breeze through all the lessons but one without losing, and that one loss was due to a minor mistake.  This mode could be useful to those who are new to music, but it may also be frustrating to those who lack patience.The other two modes are fairly disappointing.  One of them, Mii Maestro, has you conducting a symphony.  To conduct, you simply lift your arm then bring it down at whatever speed you wish.  This allows you to control the tempo and volume of the orchestra.  It doesn't feel very accurate however.  I used to be in a symphony, so I have witnessed a conductor on multiple occasions, and conducting is much more complex than a simple up-and-down hand motion.  It didn't feel very accurate, and even though I knew some of the pieces and have good rhythm, I still couldn't figure out how to get a high score for some of the songs.The final mode is a set of lessons for various styles of music.  There are lessons for rock, jazz, reggae, classical, and Japanese music.  Each of these lessons teaches you little tricks for using certain instruments, but the techniques given are difficult to remember, and you'll quickly become bored after playing Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star over sixty times.  It was nice to be able to hear each instrument and learn what instruments go well together, but the way in which the techniques are taught will make you wonder why you are wasting time with this game.Lastly, I will briefly mention Wii Music's presentation.  The presentation is similar to Wii Sports and Wii Fit--the interface is simplistic, and a minimalistic approach is used with the graphics.  This likely won't surprise anyone who has played other casual games for Wii.  I like how the interface is simple, but there are some design flaws.  For one, the musical maestro who teaches you everything is extremely annoying, and someone who observed me play this game commented that he sounded like he was speaking gibberish with Mario's voice.  He quickly becomes annoying, and at times there is far too much text.  One aspect of the presentation is impressive however--I like how you can send videos of your performances to friends online.  While sharing videos is a cool feature, it doesn't do much for Wii Music since it is such a boring game.  It is unlikely that your friends will want to yawn at your videos when they are already bored to tears by their own.I am extremely disappointed with Nintendo's latest casual game for Wii.  As a long time supporter of the company and Shigeru Miyamoto, I was surprised at how mundane this title turned out to be.  I was definitely expecting more in the gameplay department.  There are many other casual games that are more fulfilling than Wii Music.  Nintendo has gotten lazy recently, and to keep them in check, I recommend that consumers avoid this title and make better use of their money by purchasing one of the great original games that have been released this year.  I mean come on, would you rather spend fifteen dollars for a masterpiece such as World of Goo, or spend fifty dollars on a noisemaker?
I never should have played the original or this updated version of the most overrated Mario title Nintendo ever released.  The praise this game STILL receives in this day and age, not necessarily for its gameplay but mainly for its influence mind you, is staggering... and sickening.  Super Mario 64 never impressed me at all in the N64 days nearly 18 years ago when I was supposed to swallow the enormous popularity but intelligently never did, and it certainly doesn't impress me now.  Nintendo had a perfect opportunity to finally make this overrated lackluster game into something truly special from a gameplay perspective but they failed to do so.  They could have finally corrected a wrong that's been annoying me for the better part of two decades.You can play as not only Mario but also Luigi, Yoshi and Wario each with their own unique abilities.  You have to search for and pick up their caps scattered throughout the levels, often times worn by the enemies meaning you have to take out the enemies to obtain them.  These are nice additions admittedly and I honestly don't even need to tell you what these abilities are- you already know since they haven't changed in years.  Luigi jumps high?  No way!  Wario's powerful?  Get out of town!  Yoshi spits eggs?  I doubt that!  Yeah, you get the idea.  There's a few other things this game adds that's totally unnecessary such as gigantic-sized Mario that can smash anything in sight for a few seconds, an overused cheap gimmick that would soon explode in eye candy redundancy when the New Super Mario Bros. games would release, and those irritating rabbit chasing games which appeared quite often in the Galaxy series.  The one mistake the Galaxy series made was including so many rabbing chasing obstacles and... Super Mario 64 for the DS gives us more of those than we can honestly handle.  Chasing rabbits is stupid!  The worst part is that there's an extended rabbit grabbing mission both inside and outside the castle when you get close to the end of the game that takes up a good 10 minutes of playtime and it's absolutely terrible.  The bloated floating Mario power-up is kind of cool though.The most unusual and annoying aspect of this game that totally perplexes me is that the levels *still* feel needlessly overlarge.  Nintendo had a ripe opportunity here to fill in all these dreadfully empty and boring areas with tons of goodies to make them feel complete.  I mean why not fill in the empty areas?  Instead Nintendo left these stages the way they are more or less.  They wanted to preserve the game the way most people like it which was of course a bad idea.  Of course the even BIGGER insult is that Nintendo added a few new levels that feel incomplete and outdated just like the regular levels!  Why Nintendo, why?  Why match basic, unfocused blocky-shaped level design with MORE basic, unfocused blocky-shaped level design?  Instead of fixing the outdated-ness of the presentation of the game, Nintendo just throws in a few more simplistically created areas and calls it a day.  Talk about a slap in the face for those of us expecting something more appealing visually.Another really big problem is that in order to grab all 150 stars, we have to go through the same levels AGAIN AND AGAIN!  Talk about repetition at its absolute worse, and going through the same areas over and over will only end up making me want to replay this game even less.  And by less I of course mean never again.  Knowing that the game is STILL intentionally made to force gamers go through the same areas yet again just to obtain another golden star is really pathetic.  Create Mario games either the Super Mario Bros. 3 way where you only have to go through a stage one time before moving on, or the Yoshi's Island way where if you successfully collect everything your first time and 100% a level, you won't have to return to the same stages anymore.  Don't MAKE us go through areas we already completed time and time again for one simple little golden star where the "adventure" getting to it is hardly ever rewarding, challenging or lengthy enough to make an impression anyway.The controls are horrible once again, this time persevering a d-pad instead of a big clunky N64 controller (both ideas fail to work right).  The music is absolutely terrible beyond comprehension.  Having to constantly rearrange camera angles is incredibly outdated and annoying.  Super Mario Galaxy proved that switching camera angles is no longer necessary.  It's WAY too happy which is no doubt deliberate on the part of Nintendo for the entire purpose of rubbing more salt in the wound.  Seriously Nintendo, it's possible to make happy music without the irritating obnoxiousness that only ends up distracting what's clearly already a really lame and outdated game overall.  No need to make the experience even worse with music that makes you want to tear the skin off your body.  An example of quality happy music is the stuff we hear throughout World 1 of Super Mario Bros. 3.  Remember the joyful and innocent music in that game?  The music was tame and never frantically irritating.  In Super Mario 64 DS however, the music's like a hayride from the county fair to the downtown post office that rides on an endless loop in the most annoying way imaginable.  Super Mario Bros. 3 is just one of several examples I could name that shows the way music SHOULD be for a platformer that often times requires concentration to succeed.  At least the remixed soothing water music now with techno-ish beats is decent.  If any other themes have been remixed I can't tell.And we have 30 more stars to collect bringing the total to 150 this time around, which means an extra hour or so to collect everything the game has to offer.  I would mention several other features that drag down this supposed "classic" but I already touched upon those subjects in my review for the Nintendo 64 version of Super Mario 64 so there's no need to repeat myself here.  The cuteness factor of certain areas is enough to make me puke though.  I don't mind the occasional childish graphics and objectives, but Super Mario 64 takes the childish aspects to really pathetic depths that feels more intended for babies instead of kids.  Take the penguin race level with the penguins and snowmen for example.  *throws up*  Not something grown men who grew up during the 80's when Mario was fresh, challenging, fast-paced and arcade-like would ever admit to enjoying without blushing.  And what DOES Mario say at the beginning of each level?  "Let's tickle!"  "Miss Pickle!" "Popsicle!"  There's like a million things he could be saying there.  I was informed he's saying "Let's a-go" but I absolutely can't make out those words at all.  I had this same trouble with the N64 version since it's the same exact line lazily copied into this game.Just skip Super Mario 64 DS.  I absolutely loathe this game.  The only reason I gave it another chance is because I thought Nintendo radically changed the game and morphed it into something entirely different by ditching all the old, outdated and tiresome ideas that never worked in the first place and yet only existed in the late 90's because Nintendo was riding the 3D wave and needed something cutting edge on the market.  It's no longer 1996, though.  My how I was wrong on all counts to give this game a second chance on the DS.  The two worst levels have remained which only adds to my anger.  The level where you have to tediously and accurately jump across a series of rotating poles above the water collecting coins, and the rainbow-colored carpet ride which is essentially an auto-scrolling level when you think about it.At least the ghost house is pretty cool.  A piano snapping and chasing me around the room is pretty fun, as is punching enemies and knocking them out for coins.  But uh... coins.  That brings me to another subject and another annoyance.  Absolutely the biggest thing Nintendo should have clearly changed is the "collect 100 coins for a star" levels.  This means for several minutes I'm forced to thoroughly explore mediocre levels JUST to obtain enough coins for a star.  A sickening, dreadful, terribly unsatisfying concept if there ever was one.  You'd have to be the most delusional person on the planet to enjoy collecting 100 coins while absorbing these unspectacular levels.  I'm done with this review.  Between gamers believing this game is actually a classic and the little enjoyment I get out of it despite relentlessly giving it more chances, I just can't handle it anymore.
My grading scale with Wii Games looks like this ...5 star = A must play. No improvements need to be made. Has replay value (this is very important). I do not give out 5 star reviews open-heartedly. I consider any game worth playing, and owning is a 4 star game (which is my way of saying its 5 stars). Im very strict on 5 stars.4 star = Even if its my favorite game for the Wii, I will hand out 4 stars to it cause I can view some improvements to be made. OR it does not have replay value (meaning I played it once, I loved it but Im not gonna play it again). Either way, it was a game I would prefer over its competition / genre. I like to give any great game 4 stars just so I can leave some room for a potential 5 star future improvement of the game.3 star = Playable and fun game, I would recommend it but there may be a better alternative (a game that received a 4 star in the same genre)2 star = Not worth playing. No need to purchase. Much better games out there in the same genre.1 star = Silly game. A waste of time. No need to bother.And now we can continue with the actual review for Wii Sports ... First of all, I am a 24 year old male. I am not happy seeing a lot of 4 and 5 star reviews for this game. Its as if no other games were played therefore the reviewers had nothing to compare the game to. I can understand that as Wii Sports comes with a new Nintendo Wii. This is not a hot launch title like Super Mario 64 was for the N64. In no way should this game have the same review rating as Super Mario 64. I would give this game a 1.5 as it is 5 games in one but ratings need to be lowered! As to not fool anybody out there that this is a hot product, because it is NOT. I am one that relies on Amazon reviews for a lot of the products I buy. So I do not want to be misinformed. People who purchase the Nintendo Wii spend their time playing hot titles like Zelda, Super Mario Galaxy, Metroid Prime 3, Resident Evil 4, Mariokart Wii, etc. THIS GAME, "Wii Sports" can be seen left in its packaging unopened by a Wii owner. If I could sell this game I'd be happy. If you purchase a Wii that does not have Wii Sports, please purchase a different game. As I'm sure you can always borrow this from a friend. In fact, they may very well give it to you. I would.So lets look at this game ... The title of this review is "too much intrinsic ratings". What I mean by this is the high ratings are given to this game because it has a strong relationship with the Nintendo Wii console. Nintendo Wii is of great success (and even having this Wii Sports game included with it, I would still offer 5 stars to Nintendo Wii). But this individual game needs to be reviewed for the game that it is. And not a psychological view that 1) it is mutual with the Nintendo Wii (dont want to give a bad review to the game that piggybacks with a remarkable console), or 2) it is often the first game played on the Nintendo Wii. In fact being the most handed out game (how often are hand outs considered popular?) this game has only received less than 20 reviews. Maybe its because hardcore gamers have no interest in this game, or never bothered to play it. As I had no intention playing this game when I purchased my first Nintendo Wii.So lets look at what it offers ... these are all short games. Nothing competitive, or innovative. An introduction as other reviewers have mentioned. This is more like a demo. Or a tutorial for the real version of the games. And is very PONGY.Baseball ... only 3 innings. Cant play defense. Use no thought. You just pitch, and bat. While the computer plays the fielders. No double plays can be made, no pick-offs. I consider it an 80's baseball version of pong. It is very simplicit. What I mean by this is when you hit the ball, as soon as the fielder touches it, it will tell you whether you received a single, a double, or a triple. Can you imagine playing a baseball game on an 80's computer? Where it tells you what happens. Yes, like that. You dont tell the runners where to go or have ANY interaction with the fielders. Its very basic. Pitch the ball by swinging down. Then hit the ball by swinging across. And thats IT. Let the computer take care of the rest. No buttons need to be pushed in this game.Tennis ... this game reminded me when I was in Las Vegas. I played a game called "Ace Tennis" on one of those virtual game touch-screen machines at a bar. Again, its very simple, just swing the remote at the right time. Doesnt take any thought. The ball seems to always go over the net and land in the same spot everytime. You can do this with your eyes closed. And not to mention but when playing single player, you play on a team of two. I played best out of 5 games, and best out of 3 games, the player on my team NEVER hit the ball. He was just a stand in, I did all the work. The same was true on the opponents team, he just slid back and forth along the net, didnt do anything unless I hit a slow one just over the net. And he'll finally pong it back to me. I literally spent 5 minutes going back and forth with the tennis ball. Just same ol same ol. Opponent doesnt make mistakes (he did once though I'll admit so consider it rare).Boxing ... first day I got my Wii (I had no other games) I couldnt sleep that night. So I got up at 1:30am. Didnt have anything to do at the computer so I played Wii Sports. I had played Wii Sports for over an hour earlier that day to get used to the game. It was kind of fun at first cause you're learning the game and wondering if this really is that 4+ star game!! ... so I get up at 1:30am and I really didnt want to play it but I had no choice lol. I searched through the game TRYING to find a reason to like it but I couldnt. Boxing is probably my favorite sport here. I spent an hour boxing. It gets harder after each fight you win. Eventually after an hour you get frustrated cause you cant get any punches through and it tires you out. The controls are a little tricky too. Punches I wanted to do would rarely register (the low or side punches). You can literally win rounds with nothing but high punches (which is keeping the remotes in front of your head and swinging down as if you're beating a drum). That simple. But the only reason I liked the boxing is cause it was a nice workout for the arms. After an hour you will feel a light sweat, become a little tired, you feel the blood pumping through your arm. So boxing is something I can consider apart of a workout plan. But there could be a much better option like Wii Fit, or a more in-depth boxing game like Facebreaker for example. In fact the mini games on Rayman Raving Rabbids gave me a better workout when I was beating a drum listening to a song. It made me move my body as I rhythm'd to the beat.Golf ... frustrating. I'm not a golf fan myself. This isnt Tiger Woods here, you cant customize, or play in competitive championships. Im sure Carnival games: MiniGolf is a much better option. Brings you more into the game. This golf here is very basic. You hit the ball in the hole, try to make par, and then you do it again lol. Very "pong-y"Bowling ... bowling was hard for me. I didnt really master it. I had fun when I first played. Though having been without a game console for 6 months I was quite eager to play a Nintendo Wii again so I was thrilled no matter what I played =)And that sums up my review. This is a very PONGY game, as in basic / beginner / tutorial / demo. Its not your top of the line sport game here. I really hope this isnt viewed as a remarkable game for the Wii. I think the future of gaming has yet to come, Nintendo Wii being apart of that future and this game is just not it. Its pong. And you sure dont want to spend $30? on this game. Wow. I think the market is overpriced on that. Especially with so many in production it will greatly drop in value with time. I personally might play this game again. As I mentioned, boxing is a light workout. And Tennis is a virtual game I played at a bar having some drinks. So I wouldnt mind re-living that memory. And thats about it. Dont give yourself high expectations for this game coming from an adult perspective. For your child, they'll find more fun to it but still better alternatives for them ===
Yes, because Metroid is one of Nintendo's most long-running and successful gaming franchises, Metroid Prime 3 had no choice but to be created and released. But you know, it's certainly nowhere *near* a classic because it's basically a watered down, less interesting sequel but with slightly improved graphics and sweet-looking explosions.  Actually, the explosions aren't necessarily better than the first two Prime games, but I found myself admiring them more this time around (perhaps because I was bored out of my mind in so many other ways).Remember the original Metroid on the NES, Metroid 2: Return of Samus on the Game Boy, and Super Metroid on the Super NES? These games were released a long time ago, and what made them so fantastic was how the gameplay emphasis on each of them was on "exploration".In Metroid Prime 3, you predictably go through one hallway after another shooting whatever you see. While it's somewhat fun, the lack of exploring hurts the game a LOT and prevents it from having much in the way of replay value. I also hate how it takes such a long time to defeat some of the bosses in the game. It was never like that in the past (playing the 2D Metroid games, I mean).  Are you kidding me?  20-30 minutes to completely eliminate ONE boss battle?  Why in the heck does it take so darn long???  This complaint holds true with the previous two Prime games as well.  That's a major, unforgiveable problem.Also, and this is a pretty big complaint, the regular enemies you encounter while going through these numerous, one-way hallways are usually small, horribly animated, and just boring to watch/fight.  NOTHING compared to the enemies in the first two Prime games.  We're talking dreadfully boring enemies to the point you sometimes find yourself just preferring to run past them and not waste a single moment fighting them.  I'm extremely disappointed here.  It makes me think the third installment in the series is an obvious milk job by Nintendo.Besides the first hour of the gameplay being extremely tedious and boring because you're doing nothing but talking to soldiers like it's a borderline RPG game, exploring generic computer rooms that we've seen to death in thousands of other video games, and admiring constant blue/grayish colors throughout *every* single wall located on *every* single hallway (yes that's sarcasm) the game eventually changes so you're exploring different areas of land by way of your spaceship.  Too bad each of these lands ends up missing the mark and looking rather dull compared to the previous Metroid Prime games.  Actually it's more like a poor imitation of previous efforts.That's not quite the biggest issue I have with the exploration feature however.  The BIGGEST problem is that the game is nothing more than a lengthy series of miniature and narrow hallways constantly taking you to even MORE miniature and narrow hallways.  You're probably wondering why I keep saying "narrow" and it's because, for the most part, the hallways are exceptionally tiny and uninteresting.  It's like so much effort was put into the background graphics (which are overrated by the way- the game doesn't look *that* great) that the development team thought they could get away with slacking off on the level design.  I don't think so- if a game's not fun to play, it's not worth my time.  Basically no matter where your ship goes small hallways will definitely be in store for you.  The areas that are actually fairly beautiful are usually either too short so you never feel obligated to stop and take notice, or appear like an obvious rehash of the places you were already fascinated by in Prime 1 and 2.Ice missiles are a really bad idea.  Yes, you can freeze the lava and make a walkable platform for yourself.  Who cares?  These aren't the kind of improvements that take advantage of the Wii's capabilities.  It's not the kind of improvements to shell out money for either.  Grappling doors and enemies isn't very fun either.  In fact, you might even say it's downright cheap.  While grappling an enemy, most likely another enemy from off-screen will shoot laser balls at Samus and drain a good deal of your health.  Meanwhile you can't do a darn thing about it because you're stuck in the grappling position with the first enemy.  Oh sure, this entire process only takes a few seconds (by either letting go of the grapple or going through with it and removing the enemies shields) but SEVERAL of the space creatures in the game are frantic laser ball-shooting maniacs, so it only take a few seconds to empty good chunks of your life energy.  This means you need total preparation to deal with these tough enemy situations but unfortunately the unfair and relentless nature of their ways makes it a needlessly tough task.Lock onto enemies, fire repeatedly until they die, rinse and repeat.  It's predictable and boring now.  This is exactly what you'll be doing the entire way through.  You'll most likely be doing it while being forced to deal with unavoidable laser ball blasts by the space creatures.  I prefer the 2D games where you actually had to aim and practice your skills to eliminate the bad guys.  With enough practice you'd actually be able to *master* the games.  This is probably not entirely THIS games fault- but 3D games in general.  Ugh, enough is enough.Speaking of the Wii, who's bright idea was it to make the game so you actually have to turn and pull on the Wii remote to do certain commands involving opening doors and whatnot?  Yes, I'm referring to grappling again.  No, you don't have to do these commands for EVERY door you walk through- just specific ones.  It's still a terrible idea and it's more annoying than anything else.Speaking of doors, why in the WORLD does it take 10-15 seconds to load a door?  Are you kidding me?  This game was released in 2007 (not 1996) so it's absolutely pathetic that we have to sit there and wait for the doors to open, especially when this wasn't even a problem in the first two Prime games.  Ridiculous.  Also -while waiting for a door to open up- make sure you've taken care of all the enemies in the room (and I mean ALL of them).  They WILL find a way to sneak back into the picture and blast Samus from behind.  Such a dreadful gameplay flaw.Another enormous gameplay problem are the puzzles that require the gamer to deal with infinitely spawning enemies while trying to accomplish a task.  Many times, after spending more than 20 minutes trying to finish a task and being unable to do so thanks to the enemies being a frequent problem with their recurring ways,  I just shut the game off and say "I'm done with this BS".  I strongly dislike the way the puzzles are designed in this game.  I can't tell you how many times I was *almost* finished and an enemy became a distraction and I either couldn't finish the puzzle or died.  Frustration to the highest extent.The one positive is that Hypermode is pretty awesome.  No, it doesn't actually speed up the gameplay (like I originally thought when I first read about it).  Instead, Hypermode is the name of a really powerful laser beam-type weapon that blasts the living heck out of anything that moves.  It's pretty awesome.  However, there's a certain degree of complexity involved in using it properly that's a bit overbearing and therefore annoying.  It's only a slight learning curve admittedly because once you figure it out you'll be fine after that, so I can't complain about it TOO much. I can however, complain about something else- that being, when you immediately enter a room and become overwhelmed by enemies and therefore become corrupted right away, and you have ZERO time to react and therefore you die immediately.  Cheap, uncalled for, and severely flawed.The first three Metroid games ever made for the NES, Game Boy and Super NES were REALLY different from each other and that's another thing that made each of them appealing to gamers everywhere.  Alright, so the first two Metroid games aren't THAT much different (besides the obvious color and graphic differences) but certainly Super Metroid is a drastic step in a significantly different direction.The first three Metroid Prime games however, are all basically the same. It's *really* not like Nintendo to ever milk a series (with the exception of Mario perhaps) but for some reason, they're letting it happen with the Metroid Prime series. It's probably time they stopped working on making Metroid games and focused on another creation, because innovative gaming in the Metroid series is probably now a thing of the past.
I love the Mana series. I mean, the original Secret of Mana for the SNES is one of my favorite all-time games. It was an action RPG, good story and plot. So, when a sequel was slated for the GameBoy, I had to get it.Well, I had to get it a couple of years after it was released. Shh. Details.Anywho, I must say, I have never had so much aggravation and pain from playing a game. The AI is horrible, repeat, HORRIBLE! The story is convoluted, and the gameplay just downright frustrating. I almost regret the $20 I spent on the cartridge.GameplayI am going to get the worst part of this out of the way. The gameplay flat-out stinks. You start the game by choosing either to play as the Hero or the Heroine. The basic difference in these two is one is better at physical attacks, and the heroine is better with Mana (magic). Depending upon who you choose, the game will play differently. I chose the heroine.You start out (as the heroine) in a village, talking to your mother as you prepare to leave on a quest with some strange swordsman as a bodyguard. The village is attacked by soldiers that work for the Dark Lord. You escape, your village is slaughtered. You are taken to a manor by the mysterious soldier, where you meet the Hero. The manor is attacked, you escape again, and the Hero promises to protect you. He falls down, you run away, he is captured and beaten by soldiers.Fast forward, you wake up in bed after a nightmare recalling all this. The soldier is by your side, and you learn that you have been living with him in hiding since your escape. The story takes off from there. The Dark Lord now controls the land, he is evil, you must avenge your people, yadda, yadda.Oh yea, there is a mysterious sword called, get this, the Sword of Mana. And a goddess that turned herself into a tree to protect the people of the world. You worship this Mana goddess, because you are of the Mana tribe. It seems that you are the last of them.You now know as much as I do, and I have played the game. The plot is that horrible. You meet townspeople that tell you pointless stories or offer side quests that make no sense. While the story itself is a bit linear (run to next obstacle, defeat boss, possibly get an item for someone, etc.), you will often find yourself wandering a map trying to figure out where to go.Since save spots are few and far between, and healing in this game is a pain (either through the start menu, or using the appropriate Mana spirit, controlled through the right shoulder button on the GBA), you will find "Your strength is depleted" (i.e.; you die) happens at the worst possible time, with little warning. You then have to reset to your last save. Early in the game, this is horrible. The first cave you must travel, as the Heroine, has an enemy layout that killed me 5 times before I developed a strategy to get past the monsters.Bosses vary in the game from easy to insanely difficult. One boss in particular was on a spinning platform, and you could only hit him when he landed. However, given your level, your weapons only do like 1-2 points of damage per hit, and he has over 400 hit points. It took me 45 minutes to kill this guy. Needless to say, he hits a LOT harder than 1-2 points of damage. AND he inflicts status effects like blindness, so you may not even hit him at all.The next boss died within 2 minutes. Literally. I just ran and whacked.AI has to be the worst I have ever seen. During the course of the game, you will be partnered with various people. The battles in the game are real-time, and as long as your character is in a battle "mode", you can switch between who you are actively controlling by using the "Select" button. However, if your main character dies, you will have to start over from your last save. If you are controlling the main character and your partner dies, you can resurrect them. It is a bit unfair.The AI, though, even after I figured it out, stinks. There is a grid, with zones. You can either set your character to be aggressive or timid, use more magic or physical attacks. You position their icon within the grid to choose which attack style you would prefer. You have to manually do this for each new partner, otherwise, they will just stand there while you get yourself killed.Then, even if you do get the AI set to where they will attack, they will attack using a method that may do no damage. If they are better with Mana, they will drain their mana casting at a monster, even if it is doing 0 damage, then move in to attack with melee. Also, they get "stuck" on a map, and can't or won't follow you up a jump, across an area, etc. Once you kill all the monsters on a map, they will "teleport" to you, but that does little to help you if the monsters are ganking you.In terms of attacking and the like, it is standard RPG fare. As aformentioned, battles are realtime. You have to select the appropriate weapon/spirit to attack each type of monster. One monster may take a lot of damage from the Bow, however, another may take zero from the Bow but lots from a specific type of magic. It is up to you to cycle through each and attack appropriately.Towns are small, with standards like Inns, save points, general stores, and blacksmiths. Weapons can only be upgraded if you have special vegetables or fruits. Which you can grow with seeds that you collect in your "Hot House". Weapons can be reinforced with different materials that you find. So in short, you need to find materials to reinforce your weapon and vegetables to assign attributes.Lastly, levelling and the like is a bit confusing. You can choose a level in a class, and depending upon which you choose, you will gain in different attributes. You can choose to level any class at any time. However, your main class is fixed. So while you may decide to take a few points in say "Warrior", if you have the bulk of your points in "Sage", your main class will be like that of a Cleric. None of this is satisfactorily explained by the game.ControlsThe game controls, to their credit, are good. They respond well, and I have never had a situation where I was pressing the "A" button and felt the system didn't register the attack.Controls, for the Heroine, are as follows:Left Shoulder Button: JumpLeft Shoulder Button + A: MeditateRight Shoulder Button tap: Stat/heal boostRight Shoulder Button hold: Attack w/ spirit assignedA Button: Attack/ Select a menu optionB Button: Hold down to run/ Exit a menuSelect: Switch active character in battleStart: MenuFor fighting, you simply have to mash the A button or use magic. There really isn't much strategy in that regard. Menus are complex, though, and there is no way to quickly assign a hotkey. So, for instance, if you want to change which kind of magic, you have to scroll through menus, find the new spirit, set it, back out of the menus, then use the right shoulder button. It is just as complicated to change weapon types.Movement is like a standard GameBoy title. Not much to say there.Graphics and SoundGraphics are reminiscent of another GameBoy title, Golden Sun. The graphics are sprites, and the backgrounds are detailed and colorful. Particle effects are not really pretty. Your character is nice to look at, and menu pictures are clear, if not really detailed.Sound is standard GameBoy fare. 8-bit sounding and nothing overly special. I play with the sound off. There are different sounds for different game areas, but for the most part, you will be disgusted.There is no voiceacting. All conversations are based on text, and some story choices are text-based.Final SayThis title is cutesy, but the story doesn't make much sense. The gameplay is frustratingly unbalanced, the menus are too time consuming, and when it is all said and done, it seems like Square tried to throw so many silly side quests that serve no purpose into the title that the game borders on ridiculous. In the end, while it is a way to kill time, I wouldn't recommend this title to anyone, even the diehard fans. Save your money, and buy one of the many better GameBoy RPG titles out there, even something as text-heavy as Golden Sun. At least that one makes more sense.

This game cannot get out of its own way.The first hour of the game is barely playable because the game constantly stops you to either give you pointless tutorials and/or pointless storyline plot. You're constantly blocked from going past any area because the game forces you into doing this or that first, and it's not just about beating a certain gym first, now it's for everything. Here is basically the first hour of my game...- Game has intro, then STOPPED so your mom can get a call.- Go downstairs, STOPPED by mom to tell me the same thing I just heard from the call...why do they need to tell me this twice?- Go outside, STOPPED by rival for no real reason.- After you get your starter, you are STOPPED by rival to get his Pokedex (Why does it stop me for this?)- Move a few steps, STOPPED by rival so he can battle you.- When done, you are DRAGGED to the Pokemon Center by Bianca, who forces you into a tour of the place with no way to cancel out of it.- When that's done, you are STOPPED AGAIN by Bianca and Co, who gives you your Running Shoes. Everywhere else is locked, so you have no choice but to follow Bianca.- Get to the gate before the first path, STOPPED by the attendant there.- Finally get outside the path, STOPPED again by Bianca so she can show you how to catch a Pokemon.- Before you can get to the next town, STOPPED by Alder so he can yap about something, once again forced to follow him.- Get into town, STOPPED by Alder again so he can tell you to heal your Pokemon.- Go to Alder's house, STOPPED by Alder so he can tell you to give a Town Map to your rival first.(Why it doesn't just drag you to his house instead I'll never know, since your rival and any number of NPCs heal your Pokemon anyways, why not give Alder this function as well?)Already stopped 14 times with no way to skip through any of it before I can even do anything, and even after this you have to follow the straight path because the game conveniently blocks you from going anywhere or doing anything else. Absolutely unnecessary and terrible, where is the skip option?Moving on, this game is also unnecessarily annoying and difficult. Almost all the paths have the same exact Pokemon as the path before it with very little differences. The Pokemon they chose for this are awful with maybe just 1-2 different options unless you really want to run through the game with terrible Pokemon like Watchog and Pidove. I'm not asking for a Dragon-type off the bat but seriously, some more variety here would have done wonders. With over 600+ Pokemon, you can't tell me 1 or 2 stronger ones couldn't have made it into the first few paths, at least to add some variety to the palette.All the Pokemon you fight seeming either have Protect or some equivalent (like Detect) so they can waste your PP, just to end up dying to the same move the next turn in order to really wear you down through attrition. Everything hurts a lot with the massive level jumps, which causes you to either buy a ton of meds and/or run back to the Pokemon Center REALLY often. In just about any other NON-Black & White game, you don't need a single med to really get through the game...they were always more of a luxury than a need, but it's helpful to have...in this game, it's pretty much necessary.With few useful Pokemon to choose from, you'll struggle through the game especially early on when it jumps in levels and forces you to grind in order to stand a chance at the gym. All this was the same exact issue that the original Black & White had, so it's "nice" to see how Unova still sticks to its rotten roots here.The game also has an unending array of useless features. The C-Gear thing that dominates your touch screen is totally useless, and I would rather have my regular menu there all the time. The Xtransciever phone system is so terrible...yet ANOTHER way for them to stop you incessantly and without shame, and many of the phone calls serve zero purpose...they neither advance the plot nor do they tell you something remotely useful. They call just to say "hi" but you can't hang up on them and you can't not pick up.I can appreciate a harder game, but this game does it for all the wrong reasons. It tries to give you an updated story at the cost of not really letting you play the game, or taking away all your freedom within it. It tries to up the difficulty (I'm guessing that was a design intent) with the level jumps but it doesn't give you many options to deal with it except to struggle through it, with its lack of options at Pokemon to use and annoying moves that wear you out so fast through attrition.EDITEDHaving finished the game now, it does get a bit easier down the road, but not by much. The story is not much more improved than the original Black & White and it doesn't add much to it overall. Basically Team Plasma's old boss is still around and even though he was beaten in Black/White already, his minions still refuse to give up and keep trying to push their evil ways in Unova. It's not even really original and I got bored of it really fast. The only twist it provided is now they can fuse the Legendaries together and force you to fight this "super" version of it. Mine went down in 1 hit, which really took away from how "super" it was supposed to be. How's it supposed to take over Unova and bring a new ice age when I, a seemingly random trainer, can beat it in one single hit?The Elite Four in this game was for me, easier than a lot of the Gym Leaders were at the time...but what is more disappointing is that Iris, the new Champion, was a bigger pushover than any of them. I felt no sense of accomplishment beating her because I didn't lose a single Pokemon and only took damage once the entire time. I've lost over half my team to the Gym Leaders before this fight....yet the Champion couldn't touch me?This game does have an extensive end-game, but also makes you wish they had some of this stuff in the normal playthrough. The only Pokemon game I can remember that doesn't give you a Super Rod (or ANY rod for that matter, since the Good/Old Rods are removed in this game) until past the end of the game...and not just immediately past, but way past. This combined with what I mentioned before really limit the kinds of Pokemon you can catch and what you have access to for the majority of the game.During the normal playthrough you'll notice areas you didn't have access to...now you do. This includes the original starting area in Black/White and some other zones..a lot of these towns and paths are abbreviated...really short paths with a few trainers and a couple items, and not much else. Mostly you're going to have to revisit a lot of older places to find the Legendaries there now that you've beaten the Elite Four. Besides this there are a few more story points here and there and you can battle some boss NPCs again and that's about it. I would have liked to have (and this would have been infinitely more useful) these extra trainers during the normal playthrough in anticipation of beating the Elite Four...not AFTER I beat them which really kind of renders the whole thing useless.The last thing that really gets me is that the Forces of Nature are just outright missing from this game. In the original Black/White you can capture either Thundurus or Tornadus depending on your version, and when you did it and got both in a single game you could get Landorus too. Here, NONE of them are available...and considering they are Generation V Legendaries, where are they? Oh that's right...you have to buy a silly little minigame on the 3DS called Dream Radar to get access to them....wow. It's one thing to try and sell these little games on the 3DS store but it's another to literally rip out 3 of the Legendaries in the game just to sell it...it doesn't even really make sense because Black/White 2 is a DS game...NOT a 3DS game but you need a 3DS to get Dream Radar. So you not only needed to buy Dream Radar and play it just to get these guys but you needed a 3DS on top of this? Pretty pathetic way to sell not just the game but a whole system as well...I've never seen Pokemon sink as low as this before......though I guess I shouldn't have been too shocked since this is one of the only generations where the remake came in two versions, and in each version you could only get one of Reshiram or Zekrom, and not both. In Platinum, you could get both Dialga and Palkia. Even in HG/SS you could get both Ho-Oh and Lugia. In Emerald, you could get both Kyogre and Groudon. Here? Only one or the other.My initial review still stands...this is still the worst Pokemon game of its generation. D/P/P and HG/SS puts the whole B/W series to shame, and it's not really close. This game (White 2 for me) feels like it was pushed out way too soon and was just done to cash in on all the Poke-fanboys out there. It looks and feels hastily put together, and most, if not all of the flaws I mentioned above are not present in just about any other Pokemon game. I'm glad X/Y is out now to really finally bury this chapter of Pokemon...X/Y is yet another example of games that do not have most, or any of these flaws and is just a good, well-put together and fun to play game.Feel free to vote me down if you think this is a great game for whatever reason. For all these reasons (and probably more), I mostly hated it and was truthful about it.
*Introduction*The Metroid series is one of Nintendo's finest, and the new entry, Metroid: Other M, is finally here. After the excellent first person Metroid Prime series by Retro was concluded, it was announced that Metroid was returning to both third person view and Japanese development. Many fans were made uneasy when it was announced that Team Ninja would be heavily involved in the project, but the fact that it was being headed by Yoshio Sakamoto, who has been heavily involved with Metroid from the beginning, gave hope that the game would live up to its classic name. Sakamoto promised that this game would flesh out Samus's character as the most story heavy Metroid yet, but has this decision ultimately backfired?*Story*The story is the most controversial aspect of this game. Rather than opt for the minimalist approach of the other titles in the series, Metroid: Other M inserts a full blown Final Fantasy XIII style cinematic experience. The story begins with a recap of the events that took place in Super Metroid's final moments and leads into Samus receiving a distress signal from a space station called "the bottle ship." She arrives to find out that the Galactic Federation has already sent a squad of soldiers, led by her old commanding officer Adam Malkovich. She ultimately joins up with them and politely agrees to follow Adam's orders.The most jarring aspect of the story is the way it fleshes out the character of Samus.  While Samus has had spoken lines before in Metroid: Fusion, but they were never overly intrusive and didn't reveal a whole lot about her. However, in Other M, she not only talks, she talks a lot. For a series that has largely lived on letting the player form their own ideas about the character of Samus, this is a bit disconcerting.  The personality she reveals as she narrates the storyline is bound to infuriate many fans who have long seen Samus as a stoic and strong individual who is in control of her emotions.Throughout the game, Samus has many flashbacks to her time in the Galactic Federation with Adam which portray her as an insecure little girl who has trouble handling the fact that she's a woman in a man's world. From giving a thumbs down as a salute, to her monologues about how father figure Adam is the only one who understands her, this becomes cheesy and embarrassing to watch. Back on the bottle ship Samus continues to act submissive to Adam as she instantly agrees to disable all of her abilities at his request with zero hesitation. Later on in the game, there's a scene where Samus is so frozen in fear that she is unable to do anything. Samus comes across as insecure, uncertain, and even submissive at times.Watching the story play out, it is incredibly difficult to believe that this could be the same bounty hunter who has courageously saved the galaxy on numerous occasions. In an attempt to make Samus more human and relatable, Other M goes overboard. It's one thing to have emotions. It's another thing to be crippled by them to the point of endangering lives. For a game series that has never had a lot of story and never really needed one, I have to question why the game creators felt the need to insert this melodramatic poorly plotted mess.  The story is a major part of the game, and since you can't skip cut scenes, it is impossible to ignore.Once you complete the game, a cinema mode unlocks where you can re-watch all of the cut-scenes strung together like a movie. Whether you'd want to is another story.*Gameplay*The gameplay in M:oM is also a controversial element. Other M opts to use only the Wii pointer and nothing else for control. You hold it sideways like a NES controller leaving only the d-pad and two buttons for input. If you want to fire a missile, you have to rotate the Wii remote so it is pointing at the screen, which changes the perspective to first person. This shift is rather awkward, and you can't move while you are in this view aside from an awkward dodge maneuver accomplished by quickly shifting the pointer off the side of the screen. The controls aren't broken, but they are not particularly good, either. They work, but only just.The game itself plays more like an action game than a Metroid game. Almost all of the exploration you would expect from the series is gone, and for the vast majority of the game you are restricted to a linear path where doors will often lock behind you to prevent revisiting previous areas. There are some hidden missile expansions and energy tanks along the way, but the game pretty much tells you their exact position once you clear a room of enemies. The game only opens up to allow free exploration at the very end. This exploration makes it very clear why they decided to restrict the main story line so much, because when you have a few options of where to go, every other area is "now loading" for ten seconds, especially when you use the speed booster.The combat in this game is very easy. Due to the limitations of using a digital control pad in 3d space, Other M includes a dodge move that occurs automatically when you are pressing a direction on the d-pad. This means you will almost never get hit by anything as long as you are moving around. Samus's gun also auto-aims, so most of the time you can just shoot blindly down a corridor and not worry about whether or not you hit anything. The only challenge comes from shifting to first person to fire a missile, which is only required for boss fights the majority of the time. This is more annoying and awkward than difficult, since it merely involves waiting until you have a large enough window of time to get a missile off without getting hit.Throughout the game, Adam restricts the use of Samus's abilities until he deems them necessary, which means no more finding your abilities along the way, and also leads to illogical moments such as Adam not deciding it was appropriate to authorize the Varia suit to protect Samus from heat damage until she is already most of the way through the lava sector taking heavy heat damage along the way. This approach also means that there are no substantial new powerups for Samus to acquire. All of the significant abilities Samus has in this game are repeats from Super Metroid.Also worth noting are frustrating sequences that involve freezing you in the first person perspective until you find some tiny hard to find object. Often you will pass the Wii cursor directly over the object you are supposed to examine without the game registering it, leading to a lot of time wasted passing over everything over and over in an attempt to find what you are meant to scan. These moments completely kill the pacing of the game.*Replay Value*After you complete the game, every door unlocks, and you are finally completely free to finish your collecting spree of leftover expansions. At this point, there is also an extra boss and epilogue sequence to find. However, this can all be done in less than twelve hours the first time through, and once you do, the only reason to replay the game is the hard mode that unlocks upon 100% completion. There is also a cinema mode and art gallery that unlocks. If you don't care about getting everything, a regular main story play-through only lasts around eight hours.*Graphics*The graphics look pretty good for a Wii game, but the actual art design is lacking. The game is filled with generic looking hallways and rooms that don't really stand out visually, and the themes never go beyond the typical generic fire, ice, and jungle areas. The only thing that stands out about them is the holographic effect that appears sometimes to remind you that these are only simulations on a space station. One high point of the visuals is that the animations are some of the most fluid I've seen on the Wii.*Sound*One of the most disappointing aspects of Metroid: Other M is that the game has almost no music during actual game play. The background noise consists mostly ambient sounds and, very rarely, one or two recycled tunes from past Metroid games.  Expansions are also missing the familiar tune that used to play when you picked them up in other Metroid games. This is a very disappointing aspect of the game. The voice acting is alright, but it's not spectacular. Samus sounds monotone throughout the game and you'll be hearing her a lot. The sound effects for weapons and enemies are adequate.*Overall*In more ways than one, this game is a massive disappointment. The game is playable, but in a series as outstanding as Metroid, it sticks out like a sore thumb, and even taken on its own terms it fails to impress.

I was SO WRONG. This game is aimed at 5-10 year old gamers. You go around &#34;Chapters&#34; collecting fruit in the levels to advance, thus levels have no actual exit. There's 4 areas in each chapter. 6 chapters calls for 24 total levels in the game. To make this game even more disappointing, when you finish one level (say 1-1), you'd think you go to 1-2, but no. Instead you go to Chapter 2. What the heck?! It turns out you have to find red hearts hidden in each level to unlock a level in the next chapter. To unlock all of Chapter 1's level you have to complete one level, die, then go back. It's a stupid setup. I was really hoping for a Yoshi's Island 2 type game here but this is Nintendo cashing in on their child fanbase. Basically, if you're older than 10, this game will be too childish for your liking.

They will have to keep waiting.Wrestlemania X8 sports what feels very much like Smackdown,  but lacks many of the features the Smackdown series made it big for.  The Create a Wrestler (CAW) system,  while creating smooth wrestlers,  is very limited.  Here's a rundown:Graphics:  The graphics are great in some places,  but are inconsistant.  While some wreslters look very much like their counterparts,  many don't.  The movements onscreen are rather jerky and don't quite line up.  It's a step up from previous Nintendo platform games,  but nothing for a next gen system.Sound:  The only complaint I've come up with so far,  from myself or others is that the levels are a bit low.  If cranking your stereo or TV up a couple of notches is the only problem,  you're pretty much standing on solid ground.  The sound does indeed need some extra volume,  but is otherwise excellent.Controls:  The controls are clumsy and unintuitive.  While they're not impossible to manage,  many commands double for mulptiple things you might attempt to do in the same circumstances.  The instruction manual is horribly organized for attempting to find what buttons you hit to perform what.Gameplay:  Well,  this is what matters in a wrestling game.  Controls,  as mentioned above,  are unintuitive,  but responsive at the very least.  Timing seems less important in this game,  compared to other titles.The moveset is incredibly limited.  No Mercy had 16 different grapple moves per wrestler (Counting only front grapples for simplicity in this review),  Smackdown had ten,  WM X8 has 5. The selection of grapple options is pretty limited too.Pre-release hype pointed to slower,  more realistic gameplay,  and better &quot;selling&quot; of moves (Selling refers to taking the move and making it look good).  The gameplay is slower than the mindless funger numbing pound-any-button-and-win frenzy of smackdown,  but win strategies are still pretty limited.  As for the &quot;sell time,&quot;  expect your opponents to stay down only a little longer after a Twist of Fate or Stone Cold Stunner than if they had been nailed with an Eye rake or Fireman Carry.The grappling is also a holdover from Smackdown.  What is there of No Mercy in this game,  as we were promised?  Not much.  Attacks to the groin give a &quot;ding&quot; sound,  and the countering system uses a foundation based off of No Mercy.  However,  whereas there were dozens of possible counters,  including varied reversals for heavyweights,  light heavyweights,  an martial artists,  there is usually only one reversal to a move,  and most are shared among many,  many moves.  Finishers can be reversed,  however.Among the good are a wide variety of matches,  every sort of match your little heart could desire,  provided it makes a showing on WWF/E TV.  HEll in a Cell,  Cage,  Tornado Tag,  etc.To summarize the gameplay,  it plays like a cheesy arcade game.  In the early nineties,  we moved away from this kind of game for just that reason.  It's return is unwelcome,  and its demise will not be mourned.Create a Wreslter:  Sadly,  the CAW works like the Smackdown series,  without the benefit of all the options.  Selections are limited and hardly sufficient for coming up with a wrestler that is anything more than a hodge podge of the current pop favorites.  The CAW system from Smackdowns 2 and 3 was a huge selling point,  even to people disappointed with the gameplay.  This is but a pale imitation of better systems.Wrestlemania X8 has remained a fairly big disappointment.  Some will enjoy this title,  but I'd suggest renting it,  even if you are a fan of the Smackdown series and this review has done nothing to sway you.

I usually like to write reasonably thorough reviews, ones that give some isight into the game rather than simply rant.On this one, I'll have to suspend my policy.  Star Fox Adventures was my favorite game for a long time, only surpassed by the Ratchet and Clank series recently, and I HATED Star Fox Assault.It seems like every 10 minutes you're facing some hard-to-kill miniboss.  They dumbed-down the look of Fox McLoud himself - he's much more blocky and pixelated.  I loved the velvety fur look from Adventures.  The graphics of what goes on around him are great, but what's going on is little more than running around and shooting, interspersed with flying missions that were frankly annoying.  And will the rest of the Star Fox team please JUST SHUT UP!Star Fox Adventures was aptly named, it was an adventure with great environmental variety, a real plot, and loaded with interesting concepts and mental challenges; but Assault is just senseless running/flying around, overdone bosses and little real imagination.If you're a fan of pre-Adventures Star Fox, please disregard. :o)

If you think Madden doesn't change, play this game.  The one player competes with DOA for the title of most shallow.  Where the hell is create-a-kart, a FULL career or something to give you something new to do.  In terms of multiplayer, SO MUCH wasted potential.  Where are the bots and level designs?  Get diddy kong racing on the 64, trust me.

Before I begin this review, I'm not going to pick on anyone else's review on Amazon, but I will state that this is my personal opinion of the abomination that is Wrestlemania X8.Here's my review-Graphics-The graphics for this game aren't the best; and there's no excuse being that the majority of Gamecube games have excellent graphics. Still, I'm at least able to say the wrestler models are smooth, and the framerate is consistent, but man o' man are the graphics buggy and collision detection is truly crap. In fact, most wrestlers lack detail altogether and look about as generic as possible. The arenas themselves are decent at best and looks very crisp with clean textures, however, the crowd looks about as bad as it can get which would be a giant block of humanity flattened and displayed at 2-frame loops.Nothing special to talk about here. The wrestlers don't sell moves, generally do not look hurt and aren't exactly too accurate in size. Generic, boring graphics galore.Sound-One redeeming quality of Wrestlemania X8 would be the sound...and that's as far as music goes because the sound effects are muffled and bad. The music is really good. Each theme is accurate and a lot better than I anticipated. Just don't expect much when you hit a wrestler or slam them other than a light slapping noise or a muffled thud.There's no commentary which really sucks. I often wondered why WWE games for Gamecube couldn't have commentary when Ultimate Muscle- Legends vs new generation for Gamecube does.Gameplay-Here's the really bad part, as if the sound and graphics weren't bad enough, in comes the incredibly boring gameplay.Westlemania X8 does feature a decent enough roster, but the moves are limited and that's the main problem with this game. The movesets given to each wrestler is about 5 or so moves, a finisher, running attacks, standing attacks and some ground attacks. On paper, this wouldn't be bad, but considering every wrestler has the same bodyslam, suplex, as well as other moves shows just how much this game truly sucks. Even the smaller wrestlers movesets are about the same with minor exceptions.The match types wouldn't be bad if this game was better. You get single, tag team, TLC, Hell in a Cell, Cage, Rumble, Handicap and some other match types.The roster could've been really good, but the graphics are so bad that I could truly care less who's featured in this game. The roster consists of- The Hardy Boys, Rob Van Dam, Hulk Hogan, The Rock, Stone cold steve austin, Triple H, Undertaker, Kane and a few others. There are about 40 some odd wrestlers plus some unlockables. But the one thing that truly pissed me off was the fact that this game had the NWO in it and is such a crappy game. I can't stress it any more how much you should stay away from this game. Bad controls, collision detection problems, bad graphics, limited engine, and so many more screwups makes this title only worth owning if you intend on buying the entire series of wrestling games like myself. If you're a collector, get it, if not avoid this one. It's literally the worst wrestling game of the 6th gen and possibly ever ranking alongside such failures like WCW Nitro, WCW thunder and the abysmal WCW BACKSTAGE Assault.WCW Vs. The World for the N64 is a helluva lot better than this game in every way and that's a wrestling game that's 4 years away from being 20 years old. Terrible.

The year is 2002. President bush is plaining an invasion on Iraq because of threats of Nuclear weapons, America is entertained with American Idol. And the WWE just celebrated another Wrestlemania. In 2002 thq came out with this wrestling game. When I saw it I thought it was going to be one of the best wrestling games. But I was wrong. The controls are easy. But the game is bad. If your stone cold and you nail the stunner they get up right away. Just like on smackdown you can pop a finisher anytime. The Music is bad. And the story mode is god awful. If your champion you don't come out with the belt. My friends don't get Smackdown (err) I mean Wrestlemania X8 Get Day of reckoning. This game is very bad and should have never been created. Shame on you THQ For this game. Shame Shame Shame

Watio World is effectively a throwback to the 16-bit era of 2D side scrolling platfomers. Unfortunately, it is not a patch on any of them. The emphasis is on tedious button bashing. Instead of quickly dispatching your enemies as Sonic might do with a quick bounce on the head, gland-challenged Wario has to knock seven bells out of them first, which makes the pace slow. With the much better Viewtiful Joe out on the shelves, Wario World is the worse platform beat-em-up by far. Strangely, its' fans seem to really like it. I can only think that they haven't played Streets of Rage or indeed any 2D platformer of the Megadrive/SNES era.

Mario shows up once again, this time in his own pinball game.  I'm sure this one will sell a ton of copies. Truth be told, Mario Pinball Land is like some cheap bubble gum that loses flavor after a couple of minutes.Sure, the graphics are detailed and colorful, and all the gang of characters is here.  The pinball action is simple yet works pretty well.  So what is the problem?  Very repetitive.  The screens vary with different locales (pyramids, caves, deserts, etc) but the action never changes.  I found myself getting bored with it early on.  This one is for the kids.

True enough, Sudoku has its fair share of supporters, but whether it warrants a video game on its own remains questionable. That, however, doesn't stop the tons of Sudoku-related games on handheld consoles over the past few months. The likes of Go! Sudoku and Dr. Sudoku have made their rounds on the PSP and GBA respectively, and even the immensely popular Brain Age has a section devoted entirely to the game itself. Sudoku Gridmaster, released as a budget title, is the latest kid on the block.As the core gameplay of Sudoku never changes, the things that separate Sudoku Gridmaster and other Sudoku video games are therefore purely cosmetic. You won't find any groundbreaking graphical presentation here, but at least the game tries to reduce the blandness by offering a small variety of backgrounds for the player to choose from. The soundtracks are also changeable, even though they tend to be rather distracting when the going gets tough. And trust me, the puzzles in Sudoku Gridmaster are tough. The game offers over 400 Sudoku puzzles spanning four difficulty levels, and the higher level ones may stump even the most seasoned player. If you go into the game expecting to breeze through the levels, be warned.The game allows two modes of input. The first is the direct writing method, which is popularized by Brain Age. In fact, this method of input is very similar to Brain Age's. The player basically touches a square, and writes the answer on it. Unfortunately, the usual recognition issue does surface here though. For example, the game doesn't quite recognise my "7" properly, and treats it as a "3" instead. This is why a second method of input is included, I guess. This approach allows the player to choose a square, and then choose a number to be keyed into it. This will suit players who have problems getting their handwriting to work on the touch screen, but it's somehow less fluid as compared to just writing the numbers in.Regardless of which method you choose, you will play each puzzle with a timer. You'll then be ranked according to how well you do. There's also an option to save and exit a puzzle at anytime, allowing you to return later to have a go again from the saved point. This is perfect for a handheld, since you'd expect plenty of on-the-run play.For all its efforts to make Sudoku more fun than your usual pen and paper game, Sudoku Gridmaster has a fundamental flaw. A player can easily cheat by stopping the game, sorting out the puzzle on the top screen, and then resuming and keying in the answers on the touch screen without sacrificing in-game time. Although this defeats the purpose altogether, the fact that a "feature" like this exists may just be tempting enough for players who simply want a high score for every puzzle.The sheer number of puzzles available in Sudoku Gridmaster will satisfy fans of the game. For others, however, the game may be less enjoyable. Backgrounds and soundtracks aside, Sudoku is basically just Sudoku. If solving Sudoku puzzles is all you wanted, stick to pen and paper instead.
I agree with the other people who gave this one poor marks. The game does not make good use of the dual screens at all. And sudoku is all thisgame does.I was spoiled because the first sudoku game I bought for DS was BrainAge - please note that sudoku is only a part of the Brain Age software,sort of a "bonus". Anyway, they designed it so you turn the DS 180 degrees and hold it like a book - the sudoku grid is nice and large, andfills most of one screen. The grid navigation and number entry system are very intuitive. The only issue is there are a set number of puzzles.I wish the designers of Brain Age would put out a dedicated sudoku game with the same interface, but one that generates new puzzles.I'd stay away from Gridmaster. Another option is  Sudoku Mania, which is better and less expensive. the graphics suck, boring game
This game pales in comparison with the Sudoku found in Brain Age. The only reason to play it on the DS instead of in a cheap paper book are the electronic features. But if the interface is awful, why bother?PROS:The only nice feature this offers over pen and paper Sudoku are 2 minimal improvements: Double clicking on a number will highlight all instances of that number on the grid. And when a number appears 9 times already on the grid (not including the jotted notes) then that number fades out and you can't input it anymore. Ready for the bad parts? Keep reading....CONS:The interface! Here are the things I hate about it:1. The total grid takes up about 1/2 of 1 Nintendo DS screen. The upper screen mirrors the grid on the lower screen... and at the same size. There is absolutely no function for the upper screen. All it really offers is a timer. Too bad you can't turn it off to save power.2. The temporary numbers you use to indicate possible numbers is tiny. I'd say a 4 point font. If you're over 40 years old... save your eyesight. Now imagine that font with a dim screen (since you're using an old DS model or saving power since the upper screen is sucking it all away) ... and imagine it while moving (like in a subway or car).3. The tiny temporary numbers don't disappear when you indicate the actual number you think fits in that cell. Each cell holds up to 4 temporary numbers. So you'll have to click on the tiny corners of the cell and manually delete them.4. No option to be alerted if you enter the wrong number in a cell. (Brain Age has this option).5. Lousy music. Guess this is a plus too since turning off the speaker saves battery power.6. More bad interface.... This happened to me one time: I was resuming a saved game and made a mistake when I filled in the puzzle. I wanted to go back to where I last saved.... it's not possible except by restarting the DS. I chose to return to the main menu, hoping I could do it from there. And guess what? It didn't just delete my unsaved information but it tossed out my save too.
I really like math so how can a math game be so little fun? It taught me about negative numbers when I was trying to figure how fun this was on a scale of 1 to 5

Update- July 21, 2013I'm playing this game again after many years and oh my, what a big disappointment.  It doesn't hold up at all!  A big name Zelda title is supposed to be the greatest day next to Christmas.  Wind Waker admittedly does a lot of things right but the trade off is that it does WAY more things wrong.  Where to begin with this mess...Let's begin with the dungeons.  All of them are boring and colorless in appearance, unnecessarily overlong and confusing to figure out.  It's not like in the 2D Zelda games where sword cutting action is combined with creative puzzles- THESE dungeons are 80% puzzles and 20% action.  Having to run through gigantic nearly-empty rooms with eerie music in the background doesn't qualify as epic either.  Nice try Nintendo.  The two dungeons that are most unforgivable are the water dungeon (Tower of the Gods) and the one that involves having to babysit... er, team up with a female bird lady character named Medli and help her through the dungeon (Earth Temple).  Even though Link and Medli work together, it still feels more like babysitting.  While the dungeon puzzles are honestly thought-provoking and you will feel a great sense of accomplishment upon figuring them out, these two dungeons are the reason I'm not going back to this game ever again.  Do you *really* want to persevere this kind of torture again?  These aren't the kind of puzzles you ever desire to repeat.  Not when they take forever just to get through.  Even if you were to attempt a speedrun through these dungeons, the tedious nature of grinding through puzzle after puzzle assures you won't be speedrunning at a pace you'd prefer.The water dungeon is probably the worse of the two, but then again, maybe not.  I wasn't stuck on it nearly as long as the Earth Temple but on the other hand, the obstacles I faced were probably a lot worse.  The best way to describe the dungeon is like this- the first half is occupied with flooded rooms where the water raises and lowers approximately every 10-15 seconds, and the second half is all about a series of tedious statue-pushing puzzles.  When I say the water goes up and down I mean exactly that- you have to *wait* for the water to rise or lower because Link will then be able to swim to a platform or room within reach.  This is all totally required on the part of the player if you actually want to complete the dungeon and of course, that's why you're playing the game.  You *have* to deal with the moving waters.  In one unbelievably horrific room, you have to light a torch and jump across a series of perfectly lined up crates floating on top of the water.  Oh but that's not all.  If you miss you'll jump in the water, which means your flame will go out and you'll have to re-light the torch and attempt to move across the crates once again.  And you have to line up the crates when the water temporarily recedes so there's a proper and accurate path for Link's jumping.  If not for Ocarina of Time's water dungeon, this would unquestionably be a STRONG contender for the worst dungeon ever made.The other dungeon I mention involves the female bird lady character (Medli) where you have to do a series of tedious tasks that involve lifting her up and carrying her around or she'll get stuck behind.  She's also often needed to pick up and fly around Link to high or faraway platforms/places, and the main theme seems to be taking your shield (or Medli's shield) and reflecting the light that shines through ceiling or wall cracks in order to break open more passageways, chests or secrets, giving you access to the next area.  Your shield is basically used as a weapon in these instances.  At first it seems creative but you have to do this same task over and OVER again, and since each room serves more as overlong puzzles, you'll be stuck in this castle for hours.  I guarantee it.  Wouldn't be so bad if the enemies (such as those high-pitched screaming skeletons that freeze Link in place) were more abundant instead of scarce.  The one thing that REALLY annoys me is that you have to play "melody commands" to activate Medli a certain way.  You have to do this so many times, not just here but throughout the game, that it totally overstays its welcome after a while.  It's out of place in a Zelda game.  Just because Link played the flute in the 2D games does NOT give Nintendo the right to stretch out this unbearable mini musical story for all its worth in the sequels.  Overdone, boring and unnecessary.  In the Wind Temple, you have to guide a little mechanical propeller-lifting chicken-like thing called Makar (at least, it *looks* like a skinned chicken don't you think?) to higher areas/platforms to activate blocks and other things.  The fun wears thin when the realization that you have to do this same task over and over creeps in.  A poor attempt at designing dungeons Nintendo.  Shame on you.You already know the next problem I'm going to mention since it's been said a thousand times by now.  The actual sailing to get from one island to another takes forever with little in the way of doing anything interesting along the way.  The sail boat moves incredibly slow, and even though sometimes you might talk to a helpful fish for advice and discover treasure chests full of rupees, trifocre charts/shards or heart container pieces along the way (and even a boring rupee-collecting mini game involving a boat race later on) none of these things make up for the tediousness of waiting... and waiting... and falling asleep!  and waiting some more, until your boat arrives to your destination.  Ugh.  You can control the boat anywhere you want but it's not like there's a whole lot to do.  I realize a lot of people dislike the bird flying in Skyward Sword because it takes a while to arrive to your desired island in that game as well, but at least it's more heroic, soaring and adventurous watching Link riding a bird and closing in on an approaching island.  Here... with a sail boat... it just doesn't deliver the same kind of excitement.  Though granted, the peaceful serenity of the nighttime sailing is pretty cool especially when you glance at the moon and stars above, and I even like when danger occasionally occurs (such as swarming sharks and cannonballs later on) because it adds a bit of suspense.  I mean you're on a mere sail boat and here comes danger!  This isn't as threatening of a situation as you might be thinking, however.Several of the errands you do in town are so bad it makes me crings just thinking about them.  Having to snap photos of a man and woman when they're together or when a man is putting mail in the town mailbox?  REALLY annoying.  Starting up a ferris wheel?  Delivering love letters to characters who don't even deserve to be loved?  Chasing school children in a hide and seek game so you can impress the school teacher who's nothing but a snotty high and mighty, unappreciative nobody?  She only cares about money and being glamorous and is someone that in reality I'd avoid like the plague!  The picture rearranging games you sometimes discover on the walls of one or two rooms are really annoying too and not worth the reward for completing them (50 rupees if I remember).  There's a few other instances of errand-related annoyances, some of which are requirements.  The one where you have to crawl through a series of crawl spaces in maze-like fashion is confusing since every room looks exactly the same but thankfully this area is short, and the other one where you have to figure out which doors with a flame above them leads to your prize at the end feels like yet another waste of time but, again, it's short.On the flipside, I can name three mini games that are awesome.  The auction bidding is the most noticeable one.  It's fairly realistic and pretty fun too, especially the tension you feel after you make a high bid and you nervously count down the seconds anticipating if anyone's going to top your bid.  The battleship mini game is really fun.  I could probably spend 30-45 minutes on this game alone.  The guy in charge of the battleship game is the worst human being I've ever seen in a Zelda game.  Completely unfunny.  And the leaf parachute game where the object is to float across the water and strategically use the tornadoes to elevate your height so you can reach the finish line is the best of the bunch.  These are really entertaining games.The boss fights are alright though most of them are quite easy to take down.  In fact other than Ganon, they're *all* easy to take down.  Maybe the strategies were fairly complex back in 2003, but these bosses are too simplistic and boring these days.  The one where you have to battle a gigantic bird on a rooftop is WAY too reminiscent of the Ridley fight from Metroid Prime.  Even his attack and flying patterns are similar.  The only difference is that you're using a sword instead of an arm cannon obviously since this is a Zelda game.  Ganon's first battle at the end of the game is basically a 3 dimensional version of the Moldorm worm from Link to the Past but a much faster and harder way of damaging.  This part of the fight offensively requires luck to defeat- just hope you'll be standing near Ganon's weak point ready to strike when he speeds by.  A final boss fight should always be strategic instead of lucky.  The cel-shading graphics were the topic of conversation back in the day but now they look sort of dark, uninteresting and overbearingly cutesy.  Link and Zelda have ugly eyes and heads, and their bodies aren't pretty either.  Some of the characters such as the pirate named Miss Tetra are really awesome, but fail in comparison to the greater variety and diversity that Link to the Past and Skyward Sword's character selection presents.  The Miss Tetra storyline takes a drastic horrible turn later on when... ugh.  I can't spoil it.  All potential pertaining to the pirate storyline falls apart once *this* happens.The enemy combat usually consists of being able to walk up to most armored guards/blob creatures (and a few others) and slash them to death with your sword.  Some of them require the leaf, bow and arrow or bombs to destroy however.  Even though dealing with them is really easy, we can't overlook that it's also *really* darn fun.  Usually the guards (Darknuts) don't pose much of a threat, but sometimes you will have to prepare to move Link out of the way of a lunging sword attack.  This is usually in the later half of the game.  It gets especially dangerous when there's 3 or more Darknuts on screen.  You may have to execute some stellar sword trickery to escape.  I LOVE that one super spin attack that enables Link to spin around with his sword like a hurricane for 10 seconds and basically eliminate a room full of problems, or at the very least severely damage everything in sight.  It's awesome.  Like I say above, the melody (button) commands are awful due to this being a requirement WAY too often.  You HAVE to do this in order to change the direction of the wind so your sail boat can reach the island of your choice.  Having to frequently command a melody to steer your sail boat to another direction/location gets boring after a while, and as I say above, doing it in the castles gets especially tiresome and reduntant.I like some of the items and weapons Link uses.  The rope is a nifty way of swinging across branches to reach high or faraway areas, and the leaf parachute offers a similar function.  I LOVE the impactful beauty and effects of launching ice and fire arrows at a target as well.  The bow and arrow is a dangerous weapon as you'd expect since it's Zelda where the bow and arrow has always been crucial for survival.  This weapon is especially helpful and frequent in Wind Waker it seems.  These items and weapons really bring out the adventurous surroundings.  The game is overall very generous with the rupees as well.  You'll be collecting them by the bucket load.  They have yellow and purple rupees which adds up your amount rather fast.  Silver rupees hidden in chests under the water can reward you with 200 rupees, and orange rupees give 100.  Red rupees are back (worth 20).  Blue and green ones too.  Insanely generous.  Unless you haven't been collecting them, you'll probably have close to 5,000 by the final dungeon.  The swinging of the sword flows remarkably well.  There's no confusion in how you want to attack an enemy either.  Your sword won't ever let you down in the heat of a battle, nor will Link's movements.  The game encourages you to walk right up to enemies and slice 'em up.  If you don't, well, they seem to back off and wander around the room for a while giving you plenty of time to make preparations for another attack.  Simply put, enemies usually aren't as relentless as YOU are which may be a good thing since it means the game is hardly ever overly difficult.What I HATE however is the overlong fetch quest concerning the triforce shards and the charts.  You have to find BOTH the charts and the shards in the open water which can take several hours of searching.  You'll be sailing around for a while, but an even bigger problem is that it's unnecessary to even *have* such a quest after all the hours of boat sailing that has already taken place by this point.  This entire quest is overkill and I despise it.  I'm not too crazy about having to re-fight the bosses again at the end of the game either.  This time the colors on screen change to black and white perhaps a way to make the adventure feel more intense, and when you land the final blow you're simply transported back to the dungeon to take on the next boss.  It's... strange to say the least.  There's no feeling of satisfaction when you defeat them once again.  Then again, like I say above, there's no feeling of satisfaction anyway due to the bosses being easy overall.  Though I suppose it works in a "reminiscing over previous encounters" kind of way which illustrates how far Link has come since his sister went missing/introduction of Miss Tetra near the beginning.Wind Waker encourages more exploring than sword combat, so be prepared to spend more time exploring for items and treasures and less time fighting.  This means exploring many and I mean MANY empty islands with nothing but grass, high cliffs and trees everywhere.  Many of these islands contain caves or holes where items and chests are hidden, some of which provide decent atmosphere I admit.  After all falling in a big hole and landing near streams and being surrounded by high mountains is a unique feeling of adventure.  However there are two particularly offensive rooms near the end of the game where you keep falling through hole after hole (about 30 of them total) fighting 90% of the enemy varities you've already encountered which may be cool and serves as a nice combat-oriented mission, but feels like a clumsy way of making up for the lack of combat you experienced up to this point.  Like Nintendo just tacked this section on to make up for the distinct lack of combat throughout the game.  I'd bet anything that these two parts of the game contain more than 50% of the enemies in the game overall.  Why not spread these enemies around the dungeons and the islands?The music however, is INCREDIBLE!  Perhaps the best soundtrack ever in a Zelda game.  The soothingly beautiful credits theme is amazing beyond description, but my favorite is the fast-paced Jethro Tull or Renaissance like theme music that plays whenever you arrive to a mini boss.  It's diverse enough to be classified as a progressive rock song, seriously.  Just LISTEN to how awesome it is!  Other songs are really melodic and fit in appropriately and excitedly with the heroic theme of the fairy tale locations the Zelda series is known for.  Oh and perhaps my favorite part of the game- the dramatic and uneasy music you hear whenever you encounter an enemy.  It's suspenseful and makes you feel paranoid, threatened and overwhelmed by the upcoming danger.  It's *awesome*.  There's even some perfectly utilized sound effects while this particular theme is playing giving off a feeling of mystery and uncertainty.  I don't particularly care for the annoying sounds Link makes though.  He should have remained silent.  At least we can breathe easy knowing the one ice section later on is short because Link sliding around sounds like a baby animal being massacred by a group of wild barbarians.  Oh and speaking of which, these ice and fire dungeons shouldn't technically be considered dungeons since they're only one or two rooms long.  It literally only takes 2 minutes to complete them.Overall, go with Skyward Sword for a better 3D representation instead.  That game better represents the Zelda formula on all counts especially graphics, storytelling and overall epicness (but not music though- Wind Waker takes the crown there).  Wind Waker just doesn't provide much in the way of substance or pacing.  The triforce chart/shard quest is a big, extremely overlong letdown almost making you not want to finish the game.  How many times have I wanted to give up on a Zelda game due to boredom?  Never before.  The islands should have been closer together too.  This would have helped trim down on the unnecessary length of the game.

The one where you have to crawl through a series of crawl spaces in maze-like fashion is confusing since every room looks exactly the same but thankfully this area is short, and the other one where you have to figure out which doors with a flame above them leads to your prize at the end feels like yet another waste of time but, again, it's short.On the flipside, I can name three mini games that are awesome.  The auction bidding is the most noticeable one.  It's fairly realistic and pretty fun too, especially the tension you feel after you make a high bid and you nervously count down the seconds anticipating if anyone's going to top your bid.  The battleship mini game is really fun.  I could probably spend 30-45 minutes on this game alone.  The guy in charge of the battleship game is the worst human being I've ever seen in a Zelda game.  Completely unfunny.  And the leaf parachute game where the object is to float across the water and strategically use the tornadoes to elevate your height so you can reach the finish line is the best of the bunch.  These are really entertaining games.The boss fights are alright though most of them are quite easy to take down.  In fact other than Ganon, they're *all* easy to take down.  Maybe the strategies were fairly complex back in 2003, but these bosses are too simplistic and boring these days.  The one where you have to battle a gigantic bird on a rooftop is WAY too reminiscent of the Ridley fight from Metroid Prime.  Even his attack and flying patterns are similar.  The only difference is that you're using a sword instead of an arm cannon obviously since this is a Zelda game.  Ganon's first battle at the end of the game is basically a 3 dimensional version of the Moldorm worm from Link to the Past but a much faster and harder way of damaging.  This part of the fight offensively requires luck to defeat- just hope you'll be standing near Ganon's weak point ready to strike when he speeds by.  A final boss fight should always be strategic instead of lucky.  The cel-shading graphics were the topic of conversation back in the day but now they look sort of dark, uninteresting and overbearingly cutesy.  Link and Zelda have ugly eyes and heads, and their bodies aren't pretty either.  Some of the characters such as the pirate named Miss Tetra are really awesome, but fail in comparison to the greater variety and diversity that Link to the Past and Skyward Sword's character selection presents.  The Miss Tetra storyline takes a drastic horrible turn later on when... ugh.  I can't spoil it.  All potential pertaining to the pirate storyline falls apart once *this* happens.The enemy combat usually consists of being able to walk up to most armored guards/blob creatures (and a few others) and slash them to death with your sword.  Some of them require the leaf, bow and arrow or bombs to destroy however.  Even though dealing with them is really easy, we can't overlook that it's also *really* darn fun.  Usually the guards (Darknuts) don't pose much of a threat, but sometimes you will have to prepare to move Link out of the way of a lunging sword attack.  This is usually in the later half of the game.  It gets especially dangerous when there's 3 or more Darknuts on screen.  You may have to execute some stellar sword trickery to escape.  I LOVE that one super spin attack that enables Link to spin around with his sword like a hurricane for 10 seconds and basically eliminate a room full of problems, or at the very least severely damage everything in sight.  It's awesome.  Like I say above, the melody (button) commands are awful due to this being a requirement WAY too often.  You HAVE to do this in order to change the direction of the wind so your sail boat can reach the island of your choice.  Having to frequently command a melody to steer your sail boat to another direction/location gets boring after a while, and as I say above, doing it in the castles gets especially tiresome and reduntant.I like some of the items and weapons Link uses.  The rope is a nifty way of swinging across branches to reach high or faraway areas, and the leaf parachute offers a similar function.  I LOVE the impactful beauty and effects of launching ice and fire arrows at a target as well.  The bow and arrow is a dangerous weapon as you'd expect since it's Zelda where the bow and arrow has always been crucial for survival.  This weapon is especially helpful and frequent in Wind Waker it seems.  These items and weapons really bring out the adventurous surroundings.  The game is overall very generous with the rupees as well.  You'll be collecting them by the bucket load.  They have yellow and purple rupees which adds up your amount rather fast.  Silver rupees hidden in chests under the water can reward you with 200 rupees, and orange rupees give 100.  Red rupees are back (worth 20).  Blue and green ones too.  Insanely generous.  Unless you haven't been collecting them, you'll probably have close to 5,000 by the final dungeon.  The swinging of the sword flows remarkably well.  There's no confusion in how you want to attack an enemy either.  Your sword won't ever let you down in the heat of a battle, nor will Link's movements.  The game encourages you to walk right up to enemies and slice 'em up.  If you don't, well, they seem to back off and wander around the room for a while giving you plenty of time to make preparations for another attack.  Simply put, enemies usually aren't as relentless as YOU are which may be a good thing since it means the game is hardly ever overly difficult.What I HATE however is the overlong fetch quest concerning the triforce shards and the charts.  You have to find BOTH the charts and the shards in the open water which can take several hours of searching.  You'll be sailing around for a while, but an even bigger problem is that it's unnecessary to even *have* such a quest after all the hours of boat sailing that has already taken place by this point.  This entire quest is overkill and I despise it.  I'm not too crazy about having to re-fight the bosses again at the end of the game either.  This time the colors on screen change to black and white perhaps a way to make the adventure feel more intense, and when you land the final blow you're simply transported back to the dungeon to take on the next boss.  It's... strange to say the least.  There's no feeling of satisfaction when you defeat them once again.  Then again, like I say above, there's no feeling of satisfaction anyway due to the bosses being easy overall.  Though I suppose it works in a "reminiscing over previous encounters" kind of way which illustrates how far Link has come since his sister went missing/introduction of Miss Tetra near the beginning.Wind Waker encourages more exploring than sword combat, so be prepared to spend more time exploring for items and treasures and less time fighting.  This means exploring many and I mean MANY empty islands with nothing but grass, high cliffs and trees everywhere.  Many of these islands contain caves or holes where items and chests are hidden, some of which provide decent atmosphere I admit.  After all falling in a big hole and landing near streams and being surrounded by high mountains is a unique feeling of adventure.  However there are two particularly offensive rooms near the end of the game where you keep falling through hole after hole (about 30 of them total) fighting 90% of the enemy varities you've already encountered which may be cool and serves as a nice combat-oriented mission, but feels like a clumsy way of making up for the lack of combat you experienced up to this point.  Like Nintendo just tacked this section on to make up for the distinct lack of combat throughout the game.  I'd bet anything that these two parts of the game contain more than 50% of the enemies in the game overall.  Why not spread these enemies around the dungeons and the islands?The music however, is INCREDIBLE!  Perhaps the best soundtrack ever in a Zelda game.  The soothingly beautiful credits theme is amazing beyond description, but my favorite is the fast-paced Jethro Tull or Renaissance like theme music that plays whenever you arrive to a mini boss.  It's diverse enough to be classified as a progressive rock song, seriously.  Just LISTEN to how awesome it is!  Other songs are really melodic and fit in appropriately and excitedly with the heroic theme of the fairy tale locations the Zelda series is known for.  Oh and perhaps my favorite part of the game- the dramatic and uneasy music you hear whenever you encounter an enemy.  It's suspenseful and makes you feel paranoid, threatened and overwhelmed by the upcoming danger.  It's *awesome*.  There's even some perfectly utilized sound effects while this particular theme is playing giving off a feeling of mystery and uncertainty.  I don't particularly care for the annoying sounds Link makes though.  He should have remained silent.  At least we can breathe easy knowing the one ice section later on is short because Link sliding around sounds like a baby animal being massacred by a group of wild barbarians.  Oh and speaking of which, these ice and fire dungeons shouldn't technically be considered dungeons since they're only one or two rooms long.  It literally only takes 2 minutes to complete them.Overall, go with Skyward Sword for a better 3D representation instead.  That game better represents the Zelda formula on all counts especially graphics, storytelling and overall epicness (but not music though- Wind Waker takes the crown there).  Wind Waker just doesn't provide much in the way of substance or pacing.  The triforce chart/shard quest is a big, extremely overlong letdown almost making you not want to finish the game.  How many times have I wanted to give up on a Zelda game due to boredom?  Never before.  The islands should have been closer together too.  This would have helped trim down on the unnecessary length of the game.
This is the worst zelda game of all time for all nintendo systems.  It just doesn't have the charm of the other zelda games.  It gets really old and tedious spending all that time sailing across an ocean. Somehow sailing across an ocean and Link just don't match up. It doesn't stand the test of time like the other zelda's.  I played through all zelda games all the way through.  Here's my favorite zelda games in order.........1.  Link To The Past - snes2.  Ocarina of Time - N643.  Legend of Zelda - nintendo4.  Majora's Mask - N645.  Legend of Zelda 2 - nintendo6.  Windwaker - gamecubeSorry folks nintendo got it wrong with windwaker.  Hopefully they'll redeem the magic of zelda with twilight princess.

Guys are you serious? golden sun tla get 4.8/5 stars? Why everyone rated this mediocre game so high is beyond me.Positive- I like the puzzle-oriented dungeons and the Dijn system- some tunes are catchy- at least better story then golden sun 1Negative- worst sound effect ever, really disturb me, the noise of a drill is a lot better to my  ears- graphic in the word map is laughable, the most deformed pile of pixel ever seen, the other in game graphics are no good either. battle graphic is pixellated almost as the word map. the exploration graphics are really overrated, repetitive and the color palette is too light.- story is very lacking, childish, generic, cliche and predictable.- characters are not interesting at all, a bunch of  stereotyped childs.- aside from the story, this game is 100% identical to golden sun 1- arghh the worst thing about golden sun, the atrocious script. I nerver seen most long, stupid and boring dialogues like these. seems like the script is writed by moron  childs... and for moron childs, the yes-no choices are totally useless and make the game dialogue even more stupid.graphic : 5/10music: 8/10story: 5/10characters: 5/10gameplay: 8/10sound effect: 0/10originality: -10/10dialogue: -1000000000000000/10

What always brought me to the world of Legend of Zelda was the classic idea of good versus evil. As we learned in Wind Waker whenever a grand evil reveals itself, one in green appears to battle for good. This of course is link and or his descendents. Is he hyrulian, is he a kokori? It doesn't matter in that the mantle of this hero of the tri-force of courage that passes to the next incarnation of the one.My favorite Zelda game is by far link to the past. First available on Super Nintendo then re-issued for GBA. It is the classic elements of this game that does so well in Ocarina of time and Majora's Mask. However Minnish cannot capture the successes of these games' magic.Zelda has always been about solid puzzle solving. Push block A and lay pot on switch B to open door, reveal chest, etc. Minish of course has these elements, and the dungeons are pretty true to the classic structure seen in Link to the Past. But its the Kinstones that ruin this game. The idea that to unlock areas you have to find a small piece of stone behind an unmarked wall to bomb then find the person whom it can be fused to made me loose interest so quickly. I planted tons of bombs, used up tons of time just to find a kinstone piece, then to have to find someone to fuse it with. Then I could continue with the adventure. Now perhaps if they add some sort of stroy as to what the heck these kinstones were or why everyone has them was never develpoed. And so my interest in finding them too waned. Maybe a checklist of the kinstones and where they are fused to, much like the mask chart in Majoras Mask.Seems that games today leave story, gameplay, and good level design in the back burner for collect-o-thons. Pokemon may be to blame and its popularity of having to catch'em all. But Pokemon's game is that. To collect the best to battle with and in turn kick the butt out of your friends, and computer. I don;t play a zelda game to collect hundereds of kinstones and figurines. Who cares. I want a good story, cool dungeons, weapons and abilities that its not the finding out how to use them that are hard, its the using them correctly that is hard.The game also tries hard to rip-off four swords ideas with multiple links doing things single links cannot. Good idea. All the elements are here for this game to rule. It just seems to fall flat and be pretty uninteresting to play. Maybe its the never knowing where to go next that makes it no fun. You basically try everything until you give up and look at the players guide. So it makes me think that this game was developed just to sell those players guides.Minish Cap was not released during the Holiday season and now I see why. It is lackluster and quite mind numbing. I am not swearing off Zelda games, just this one. I will definitely be playing the new upcoming zelda on the gamecube with the more realistic graphics. Wind Waker, though cool to look at, had huge problems with goofy characters that really seemed to keep the true terror of Ganon at bay. i never felt threat as I did in Link to the Past or Ocarina.  Minish trys to look just like Wind Waker. The minish themselves are akin to the ewoks and are too cutesy for their own good. This makes for a weird looking link and goofy side kick. Truthfully I don't mind illustrative graphics. But these counter-act the underlying story of threat and fear that propels me through other nintendo games like Metroid or the original Zeldas.Play it and see for yourself but I rather spend my time replaying Link to the Past, or a Final Fantasy. Or better yet World of Warcraft.

I'm sure it's not the worst Mario game out there, but it's the worst one I've played. It's not a horrible game, but it's just not as good as its predecessors or its successors. The biggest complaint I have are the controls and the physics. It doesn't even feel like a Mario game. The controls are klunky and often unresponsive, the physics are weird, like the Fire Flower's Fireball. It ricochets everywhere before eventually going out. The enemies are unlike anything I've ever seen in Mario. In one world, you have to Easter Island Heads with arms and legs, kinda like Nosepass from Pokemon. The Koopas explode when you jump on them. I don't mean they explode and die, i mean, when you jump on them, they go into their shell, and explode like a Bob-Omb, hurting you if you're too close. The graphics, I can't give TOO much flack to because it IS gameboy, but it doesn't look much better than the Mario Calculator games I played back in highschool. I'd say skip this one, go straight to Mario 2. It's much MUCH better.

meh
this game is horrible and i agree with the reviewer "coconut". Nintendo didnt make/develope this game and it is obvious. This game is unforgiving and so challenging to a degree that it feels like beating this game is impossible to beat. This game is unbearable to play. If you want a good version of this game, buy the one for gameboy advance. If you do not own that system, this game can be downloaded via virtual console on the ds. Do not buy this ds version of this game

The Wii will destroy the card at random.All saves on the card will corrupt.  They will remain corrupt when moved to a 59 or a 251.  They remain corrupt when using the card on a REAL Gamecube.  The card remains corrupted when all saves on the card have been erased and new saves are started using ONLY a real Gamecube.It's a $20 white brick.The background:I purchased this 1019 memory card when I bought my Wii.  I never had a Gamecube, so I thought I'd mess around with some Gamecube games due to the Wii's backwards compatibility.  Deceptively, with no issues, I played several Gamecube games on my Wii over the course of a few months.Then I played F-Zero GX with 1019 on Wii.  From that point on, my 1019 was bricked and all my saves were lost.  Are certain games' save mechanisms not compatible with Wii/1019?  Is the Wii randomly introducing electric shock to corrupt the card?  The cause may not be known, but I have a $20 white brick.  It can't be formatted.I'll consider buying another someday, but only to use in a real Gamecube. the graphics suck, boring game

I loved this memory card.  I had all my information saved on it.  This is now the reason I hate it.  This memory card corrupted for me.  I lost EVERYTHING for Gamecube as far as saved information goes.  I am an extreme gamer, and the information lost was cumulative WEEKS of time of my life lost.  The 1019 blocks is a lot and I would have 5-starred it until now.  Now it gets 2 stars.  It would have gotten one star if I didn't love it while it worked.  The fact of the matter is:  there are too many blocks in this memory card to provide stability.  The more information you save on to it, the more like Jenga it becomes until it finally topples and corrupts.  You would be better off buying four 251 block memory cards.

Let me just start off by saying that I have never played a better Game Boy game, nor a better Mega Man game. The introduction of a REALLY powerful sword into a sidescrolling shooter is so out of place is to be AMAZINGLY fun. The satisfaction of jumping over a slow-moving energy shot and coming down and slicing the enemy in half all in the same fluid move is not to be ignored. However, game companies and designers seem to have lost sight of the reason people play videogames: to have fun. Of course, a game that lets you win too easily is no fun, but a game as aggravatingly difficult as Mega Man Zero should be banned. This is the one that will have you flinging your GBA out the window, ladies and gentleman. Let me give you an example: I'm a slightly above average Mega Man gamer, so after taking a few lives to strategise against a boss, I restart the game, and take him on. With only 2 ticks left on my health meter, I decide that I WILL NOT LOOSE, and that I'm going to play the rest of the battle perfectly. I do, and I beat the boss. Then the game says "Oh, you had a brilliant victory and you're almost dead... well now you need to escape from tons of falling stone THROUGH A LOCKED DOOR." What the ... do you think I am, the next Houdinni?? MEGA MAN DOES NOT WALK THROUGH WALLS. In addition to which, one of the first and foremost rules of VideoGame developement is: ONCE YOU BEAT THE BOSS THE LEVEL IS OVER. In a game as frustratingly hard as this, if the level isn't over, a health refill is in order. BTW, for MMX vets, there are no SubTanks in this game. In the end, get the game, but only if you have enough money to replace your GBA Unit when you toss it on the ground and jump on it till it's dust.

The collecting seems endless, and when i was forty % done the game, i just stopped. I looked at this forest level and i said, this looks just like the desert and water ones, only with a different backdrop.And what's with the story? Some giant floating island or something? Why does K Rool have such a loathing for the Kongs? WHy doesn't he just butcher them instead of placing them in unguarded, easily escapable places???? Rare really messed up on this one. The sound isn't all that awesome (the DK rap, what the heck was that?), and the graphics were bleh; this thing required the 4mb expansion? Banjo Kazooie looked twice as good.Even the characters are lame. I thought the release of Kiddy Kong in DKC3 was dumb, but now we have three new characters that couldve easily been replaced by 2 old ones. Tiny is the spitting image of Dixie, and Lanky is the babyish side of Kiddy while Chunky is, well the chunky side.I think Rare thought their game was weak themselves, that must be why they added this mediocre 3rd person shooter multiplayer, isn't it? They didn't think they did a good job on the shooter part did they?I have so many peeves about this game, it's nuts. What difference is tehre between the gun and the instrument??? They both unlock things. Why did Rare feel it necessary to have two things that can work switches??Honestly, the only entertaining and redeeming part of this game are the Jetpac and Donkey Kong hidden arcade games.Certainly a long game, but length is not always a good thing. Look at Conker's BFD, it was short, and still owned this game wicked bad. 15 hours of this, and you'll wish Rare had stopped there.

This is a horrible game! It is really, really gory and nasty. The multiplayer mode is hard, and Rare really made a big mistake! If I could choose to buy either Yoshi's Story or BFD, I would choose YS, and I'm 19! Oh, Conker, what have they done to you!

At first I didnt like this game, then I got into it. It's like an electic boardgame. The one thing I hate is playing against the consol. Always play with four real people.

Like i said i do not like RPGs and especially this one. I have it because of course its mario and im willing to try any mario. It takes so long to beat it because the RPG and it gets on ur nerves when u cant beat a boss or enemy and u have to restart and beat them. At the begining it has some cheesey video of what happend to peach. It took me forever to beat it and as soon as i did i felt much better and it did not seem as much as a dumb game. The graphics r ur ordinary snes graphics and the sound is not as good as most snes games. I dont like it because its an RPG but the only reason i keep it is because it adds to the collection and my little cousin loves to play it.

By this point, most gamers have tried the original "Donkey Kong".  While not quite as iconic as Pac-Man, "Donkey Kong" was effectively what put Nintendo on the map in the gaming industry, and the debut of a certain "Jump Man", who would later be renamed Mario.  You may have heard of him.  He went on to have a pretty successful career after this game.So what is "Donkey Kong"?  A giant ape who kidnaps Pauline (not Princess Peach), who Mario . . . er, Jump Man must rescue.  Donkey Kong throws barrels at Jump Man. Jump Man must avoid the barrels, jump over other obstacles, climb ladders, etc, to get to the top of the screen and save the princess from the throes of Bowser . . . er . . . Donkey Kong!What is notable about this game and other early pre-Famicom/NES titles was Nintendo was actually a third party.  Once upon a time, in the early 1980s they licensed their IPs to other platforms at the very start of their foray into video games. Given the troubled fortunes of the Wii U during its initial launch cycle, and Nintendo President Saturo Iwata's adamant refusal to license out its IPs to tablet/smart phone devices, playing Mario and Donkey Kong on anything other than Nintendo hardware just seems bizarre, and that's because no one has played their Ips on non-Nintendo hardware (at least, legally), in decades.One of my first experiences with Nintendo games was playing Donkey Kong and Mario Bros on the Atari 2600. In 1983 Nintendo and Atari were trying to broker a deal and when that fell thru they brought out the Famicom that year and the Pal/US equivalent (NES) in 1985. Before that though they did publish their games on the Atari and some other hardware.The Gameboy Advance title in the Classic NES series is, appropriately enough, the NES version of Donkey Kong.  The problem with the NES port is that it's only three levels, and is missing the fourth level that was exclusive to the arcade (which is the pie level).By now, years after its release and the Gameboy Advance long superceded by Nintendo's subsequent handhelds, there is very little appeal in picking up this edition of "Donkey Kong".  First, it's only three levels long and can literally be beaten in ten to twenty minutes, with the only appeal being to go for high scores (which was appropriate to the market in the early 1980s . . . but even by the late 1980s, people just didn't care about high scores).Overall, the Classic NES series was fairly disappointing.  With few exeptions (such as "The Legend of Zelda", "Zelda II: The Adventure of Link", and "Super Mario Bros."), Nintendo released (in America, anyway), mostly very short gameplay experiences.  The Japanese "Famicom Mini" series had a much stronger lineup than the games we got in the West.In terms of Donkey Kong, I would pick it up on the Virtual Console if you really want to play it.  Do not waste your money on the Gameboy Advance version.

When I think of the N64, I think about great games and memories. Games like Golden-Eye 64, The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, Super Mario 64, and Banjo- Kazooie. Memories like getting my fore-head shot by my brother, grabbing my 120th power star, and meeting Princess Zelda for the first time.Donkey Kong 64 doesn't come up in any of these if you haven't noticed by now, and for good reason. It's slow, pokey, and not really all that fun. Which is really a problem after the success of the Donkey Kong Country trilogy.THE GRAPHICS: Donkey Kong 64 seems to take the graphics roll from Super Mario 64, in that the characters are a little on the blocky side, but their really not all bad. I've only come across a few complaints which is demonstrated in the following description: In one area, the room has a large wooden treasure chest with a switch of the character's face on it. Sounds fine right? Wrong, the switch attached to the chest is made from a vent in one of the previous areas. A metal switch attached to a wooden chest. Sheer laziness. VERDICT:*** 3/5THE STORY: Quite simple really, Donkey's horde of bananas have been stolen once again by King K. Rool, ruler of the Kremling reptiles. He's also done the liberty of imprisoning all of the other Kongs in cells mapped around the game. The game introduces many new character like Lanky Kong and the banana fairies, along with some pretty whacked up levels. It's not really all that original, but it works.THE VERDICT: *** 3/5THE GAME-PLAY: This is where Donkey Kong 64 kills, and not in the good way. The game rips from the popular "grab the golden item to proceed to more levels" style originated by Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie. Now, that would be fine since the genre has pretty much held water for years, but DK64 has you "power-walking" your way through each task, some of which are dragged on already.It takes me about 7 minutes just trying to go to the level I choose (except the first level). The game is loaded with long hallways, ledges you need to slowly climb, and slow frame-rate issues at times. If Rare had upped the speed to about 2.33 times faster, I probably wouldn't have constantly been yelled at to leave my younger brother's room so he could sleep. Oh yeah, and I got a serious sore thumb from holding the joystick in the same direction. This game ruins hands, and sleepy little brothers. THE VERDICT: * 1/5THE MUSIC: The game ranges from toy factories, jungles, pyramids and the like, so you can imagine a wide arrange of tunes to come across. Some of the music is pretty catchy, but I didn't find myself dazzled by any means. I found myself humming 2 or 3 songs, but that was it, none of which you'll be hearing very often. The sound-effects are fitting and pretty original. Thanks to this game every time I see an orange, I immediately think of the sound the orange grenades make in this game. Pretty funny right? VERDICT: *** 3/5OVERALL: DK64 had a lot of hype, and it's a shame it didn't turn out since it was made by the same guys behind the Donkey Kong County, Battletoads, and Jet Force Gemini series, which were excellent gems. I played this game as a kid years ago and completed everything in the game, I really must have exaggerated greatly how fun it was back then, because I can't seem to have any courage to attempt getting everything in just level 4. While the music is descent, the graphics okay and the story shallowly good, none of those elements are what make you play a game. You play to have fun, to enjoy the universe of the characters, and to enhance you skills. I'd be able to accomplish all those things twice as much just eating a banana and watching my dad trim his nails than playing Donkey Kong 64.OOOOH BANANA.OVERALL VERDICT: ** 2/5
When I think of the N64, I think about great games and memories. Games like Golden-Eye 64, The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, Super Mario 64, and Banjo- Kazooie. Memories like getting my fore-head shot by my brother, grabbing my 120th power star, and meeting Princess Zelda for the first time.Donkey Kong 64 doesn't come up in any of these if you haven't noticed by now, and for good reason. It's slow, pokey, and not really all that fun. Which is really a problem after the success of the Donkey Kong Country trilogy.THE GRAPHICS: Donkey Kong 64 seems to take the graphics roll from Super Mario 64, in that the characters are a little on the blocky side, but their really not all bad. I've only come across a few complaints which is demonstrated in the following description: In one area, the room has a large wooden treasure chest with a switch of the character's face on it. Sounds fine right? Wrong, the switch attached to the chest is made from a vent in one of the previous areas. A metal switch attached to a wooden chest. Sheer laziness. VERDICT:*** 3/5THE STORY: Quite simple really, Donkey's horde of bananas have been stolen once again by King K. Rool, ruler of the Kremling reptiles. He's also done the liberty of imprisoning all of the other Kongs in cells mapped around the game. The game introduces many new character like Lanky Kong and the banana fairies, along with some pretty whacked up levels. It's not really all that original, but it works.THE VERDICT: *** 3/5THE GAME-PLAY: This is where Donkey Kong 64 kills, and not in the good way. The game rips from the popular "grab the golden item to proceed to more levels" style originated by Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie. Now, that would be fine since the genre has pretty much held water for years, but DK64 has you "power-walking" your way through each task, some of which are dragged on already.It takes me about 7 minutes just trying to go to the level I choose (except the first level). The game is loaded with long hallways, ledges you need to slowly climb, and slow frame-rate issues at times. If Rare had upped the speed to about 2.33 times faster, I probably wouldn't have constantly been yelled at to leave my younger brother's room so he could sleep. Oh yeah, and I got a serious sore thumb from holding the joystick in the same direction. This game ruins hands, and sleepy little brothers. THE VERDICT: * 1/5THE MUSIC: The game ranges from toy factories, jungles, pyramids and the like, so you can imagine a wide arrange of tunes to come across. Some of the music is pretty catchy, but I didn't find myself dazzled by any means. I found myself humming 2 or 3 songs, but that was it, none of which you'll be hearing very often. The sound-effects are fitting and pretty original. Thanks to this game every time I see an orange, I immediately think of the sound the orange grenades make in this game. Pretty funny right? VERDICT: *** 3/5OVERALL: DK64 had a lot of hype, and it's a shame it didn't turn out since it was made by the same guys behind the Donkey Kong County, Battletoads, and Jet Force Gemini series, which were excellent gems. I played this game as a kid years ago and completed everything in the game, I really must have exaggerated greatly how fun it was back then, because I can't seem to have any courage to attempt getting everything in just level 4. While the music is descent, the graphics okay and the story shallowly good, none of those elements are what make you play a game. You play to have fun, to enjoy the universe of the characters, and to enhance you skills. I'd be able to accomplish all those things twice as much just eating a banana and watching my dad trim his nails than playing Donkey Kong 64.OOOOH BANANA.OVERALL VERDICT: ** 2/5
Conker's Bad Fur Day may look like some cute Banjo Kazooie game, but guess what? It is far more complex than Banjo Kazooie. This little twerp pees on his enemies, swears, gets drunk, posses as an army guy, and does other stupid things. This is not a game for children to be playing. He even has sex with girls in some movies. Parents, don't even consider buying this for your five year old. Infact, not even when they're seventeen.

I borrowed this game from a friend. I played for half an hour then got bored. I'm glad I didn't pay money for it. It's pretty much just Banjo-Kazooie(which I also didn't like). I was upset, especially when I got to the first door requiring gold bananas. Why couldn't they have just put out another Banjo-Kazooie game and make an ORIGINAL Donkey Kong game for the N64.Banjo-Kazooie was fun, until the difficulty spiked out of nowhere. Also, the idea of making a cartoonish adventure somewhat nonlinear is poorly executed in it.I didn't play far enough to see if Donkey Kong corrected any of this, but it looks like it didn't. It just changed the setting from running around inside of a mountain to running around inside of islands. Great.If you liked Banjo-Kazooie, I'm sure you'll love this. If not, definitely skip Donkey Kong.

Nintendo's latest shameless capitalization of a once-venerable series of games. I bit the bullet and started playing this recently, curiosity winning out over the recent experiences with Mario-branded games. Despite such tragedies of game design of the last 10 years like Mario Sunshine and Wario World, I still harbor warm feelings for the Mario games of the late 20th century, forgetting time and again that as their management and lead designers age and stagnate, fun, clever, original games like those are seemingly forever in Nintendo's past.The game started out alright, an interesting puzzle-focused twist on the main-sequence Super Mario series... they eliminated the venerable stomping-enemies-and-grabbing-power-ups formula, and replaced it entirely with simple logic puzzles in underwhelming levels usually no larger than two screens' worth. You can still jump around, but Mario's jumping range is no higher than about twice his height, which for Mario is absolutely pathetic. He also moves at a constant rate of speed no matter how long he's been running, making nimble jumps practically impossible, and skids randomly when he stops; I found myself constantly plunging into crevasses and falling off cliffs, wondering with utterly genuine surprise and confusion why the character was receiving commands I wasn't inputting. Probably the biggest sin of all, though, is the ludicrously short distance he can fall before pancaking on the ground and whining like a toddler. And if you're falling while holding something, he'll pitch the item across the screen once you've fallen a certain distance, forcing you to retrieve it once he's done feeling sorry for himself.Also, Mario's got the same voice actor they've been using in Mario games for years, Charles Martinet, who produces an entirely testicle-free whiny broken falsetto soaked in an Italian accent that rings less authentically than a Wichita Godfather's Pizza commercial. After maybe 20 minutes of gameplay, I was nearly in tears, begging the gods of video games to make him shut up... even if you're Mother Teresa, you can only really hear that "Mama Mia!" croon a limited number of times before a primal urge to exterminate mankind kicks in. And god help you if you let the rescued mini-Marios fall off the screen on the Mini Mario levels: until you retrieve all of them, which can sometimes take a while, they'll continuously shriek "Oh, Mario!" every second or so like starving lupine infants, producing a sensation that I can only describe as cannibalistic rage mixed with crippling nausea. One of the biggest letdowns in the game is the inability to pitch these mewling little parasites into an active caldera, forever silencing their demonic little voices.Donkey Kong himself is probably the strangest part of the game, though. During the opening cinematic, we see DK sitting on his fat simian butt in his house, flipping idly through channels, until he sees a commercial advertising some kind of weird mini Mario dolls. Then, suddenly, hearts appear in DK's eyes. I am not making this up. It appears to anyone with more than one digit in their age that Donkey Kong is either harboring a secret lust for everyone's favorite effeminate plumber, or has a sick fetish for plushie toys. The latter becomes evident as we see DK break into the factory and steal one sack full of mini-Marios, crippling the entire toy doll industry. Apparently in their panic, the ubiquitous, androgenous little toadstool slaves forgot they could just turn the machines back on and... uh, you know.... just, uh, make more. Instead, Mario comes to the rescue and follows DK through six worlds of improbable puzzles, rescuing one mini Mario on every level.So yeah, yet another failed opportunity to restore the Mario franchise to some mote of its former glory.  I'm sure Nintendo won't care as it'll still undoubtedly make them money, but it's yet another shovel working to dig their corporate grave.

This game is basically just an excuse for some someone with some furry cat fetish to parade around with some sick hybrid of a cat with a plumber to create this cat that runs around with a human face and mustache. This game is simply creepy and offensive.
This is my least favorite game in the franchise. (Pinball does not count.) The lack of a map and annoying Chozo Ruins music severely limit the enjoyment. HOWEVER, I do reccommend playing the 1st area of this game and then playing the AM2R demo. You will not believe the difference. I can't wait for AM2R. GOD BLESS MILTON GUASTI!!!!!!!!!!

I bo't this b'cuz I'm quite fond of SQUARE 4 the Final Fantasy series. I was sorely disappointed. While it started out great it dragged itself along. The two stories (Here/Heroine) were different, with the Heroine story being the most compelling. The game's about a world that was destroyed the wrongful use of Mana power by an evil tyrant Vandole who was subdued by a powerful Sword created by the Goddess. So now it seems the Vandole has been reincarnated intends to do it all again.The sad thing thing is that there are too many characters that have nothing to do with the overall story (The Mavoles for example) - not to mention just too many characters - period. What was the purpose of the trip to the Ice Castle - just to kill the monster and unfreeze it's people. You're sent helping people just to satisfy the "journey" aspect of the game but it contrast this game offers no real adventure or journey, and the endgame was equally as disappointing. I got confused of who the real enemy actually was and in the end I was even more confused because the game offers no resolution.The story itself was really uninspired as I had this game for a whole year without playing it, only to just "get it over with";  you will spend a GREAT DEAL OF TIME looking for Spirits, but if think the game or any character will TELL you how to find ALL 64 Spirits NO! GameFaqs will be your best friend for this game. A complete waste of time and money.

For the Nintendo '64 gaming system, the two pre-eminent adventure games were Mario and Zelda.  Those games enthralled players with their tight gameplay and interesting stories.  Unfortunately, DK '64 doesn't have that same tight gameplay, and the story was never the strong suit of the series.The problem with this game is obvious after about 30 minutes: It's all about collecting items, and very little else.  Whether it is coins, tokens, or bananas, this game quickly devolves into little more than a scavenger hunt for miscellaneous items.  Making matters worse is the fact that EACH CHARACTER needs to collect each item to unlock certain features.  The game is tedious enough playing just as a single character, but add in the four others and it becomes ridiculous.The music in this game is engaging (the DK Rap might just be the highlight of the whole experience!), but other than that nothing really stands out.  If you don't mind collecting item after item, you'll like this game more than I.  If you prefer a developed plot, however, than stay away at all costs.

I bought this game thinking that it was a new sonic game, until i looked at the case and saw a fat guy with a red hat. I broke down in tears because i wasted money on this garbage.

You can onlty expoler Hoen and there's not a lot of Pokemon form the other games. You can't connect to the other games and after the elite foure thres nothing for you to do except cath all the pokemon. You can't even travel to fight people in Jhoto and Kanto. Thats why I liked Gold and Sliver but this is stupid. You still have to make due with only Four moves not six or five, but only four moves. and some of the new pokemon is ugly and even some look alike. Also in the Pelterbug forrest cath two Slakouth because you can trade one for a pokemon I can't pronounce in Peltaburg city. In Peltaburg city you have to fight roxanne. She has a Lv. 15 Geodude and LV.14 Nosepass. Nosepass uses a attacked call Rock to mp it reduces your ablie and doese Damage!!! Use berries if you have them. If you have Treecko there is a guy in route 104 that gives a TM called Bullet Seed. teach that TM to Treecko. Bullet Seed is a Grass move that attacks 2 -5 times. It doese crital damage to Rock and fighting pokemon. If you don't have Treccko, another good poke for the gym leader is Dustox. Level up a wrumple to lv.10 and learn confusion. and Gust at lv.13. At slateport, if you defeat all the trainers in the shack you get six Sodapop!!!

This is the so called &quot;Better version&quot; of pokemon blue and Red. The only thing that's better is that you can get Charmander , Squitle , and bulbasaur. the graphics chanmged a little bit and Pikachu is the only pokemon that cries it's name!!! Why is that? But Pikachu learns new atyttacks like: Dulble team at Lv.15. It raises your Envade. Slam at Lv 20 . A normal phsical attack . and Thunderbolt at Lv.26. Pikachu is your starting pokemon. But It can't evovle. Raichu like kicks ass. Raichu has one attack Pikachu doesn't, Mega Punch. for people that don't know this but sometimes you nmeed to make some of your pokemon to elvove to mlearn new moves.

I like Poke'mon, but do not buy this game! The peoffesor runs the whole thing, Pikachu never listens, there is a time limit (...).  Be smart, don't buy it!

The elitist movie critics were in a full-fledged campaign to convince the public and themselves that the movie was the best thing since "Citizen Kane".  Back in 1999 so much praise was showered on the film that the voices of dissent were drowned out and ridiculed.  Then a funny thing happened: time passed.  Like the rest of the superficial Hollywood crowd, the elitist critics have moved on and this has allowed people to freely rethink the movie.  Now it's hard to find anyone who's filling to admit they liked the "Blair Witch Project".  Why do I mention that?  Because the story's nearly the same when it comes to the near universal praise of Nintendo's "Wind Waker" game.Since "Wind Waker" is a Zelda game, and since the Zelda franchise is amazing, the "Wind Waker" must be amazing too, right?  Right? Unfortunately, no, but equally disturbing is how the gaming community answered "yes" to that question.  They went into a full-fledged campaign to convince themselves, and the public, that this game deserved a pedestal next to "Link to the Past" and "Ocarina of Time".  Only now, years after its release, do I hear consistent complaints about the game.  Below is a list of problems with the game:1) The sailing aspect of the game takes up at least 50% of the adventure and it is extremely tedious.  Nintendo didn't even attempt to streamline this process.  You can literally set your direction, put the controller on the floor, and sit back and watch the minutes pass as Link sails along to your destination.  In order to further extend the playtime of sailing, the user is forced to embark on numerous mini-quests where many must be performed numerous times through the game.  The most annoying are the "fetch quests" where you dredge the ocean floor for items.  *Yawn* Are we having fun yet?2) The game consists of only a few dungeons, and some of them are extremely easy.  Important aspects of the game were replaced with time-consuming fetch quests from the ship.3) The game has an unexploited storyline.  I can think of numerous examples of storyline elements that seem like they should conclude in something big, but completely fizzle out.  (Between this and the lack of dungeons, I am convinced this game was rushed to market)4) I might as well say it: the graphics are terrible but otherwise fit the overall-quality of the game.  The Link model is the worst: a massive head, massive eyes, and eyebrows that somehow float over his hair.  At least you spend most of your time staring at the back of Link's head.5) Before release we were told that the NPC (non playable characters) were going to be far more advanced than others we've seen in the past.  I have no idea where Nintendo got off promoting that idea because they are identical in sophistication to those in OoT and just about every video game I've played.  They certainly aren't as interesting as those from Majora's Mask.6) And I've just grown tired of games where you must constantly switch between the game and an item selection submenu.  Metroid didn't need this and neither did Star Fox Adventures.  I'd love to see Nintendo incorporate something that would minimize this behavior in their Zelda games.  The problem is especially bad in The Wind Waker because an entire item slot is wasted on the sail.7) Fighting non-boss enemies is extremely easy.  Just Z-target and swing your sword for a few moments and the green A button icon will change to a green star and flash.  Press the button when this happens and Link does an incredible feat of acrobatics and destroys his foe.  It looks awesome, but you quickly learn that this ability makes it extremely easy to fight nearly anything.  It also makes the game feel like its playing on autopilot and you are just a bystander watching.So this is a review for those interested in Twilight Princess.  Whether your itching for a Zelda fix while waiting for TP or have played and enjoyed TP and want more Zelda, I've just gotta warn you that Wind Waker is not worth the trouble.

Metroid didn't need this and neither did Star Fox Adventures.  I'd love to see Nintendo incorporate something that would minimize this behavior in their Zelda games.  The problem is especially bad in The Wind Waker because an entire item slot is wasted on the sail.7) Fighting non-boss enemies is extremely easy.  Just Z-target and swing your sword for a few moments and the green A button icon will change to a green star and flash.  Press the button when this happens and Link does an incredible feat of acrobatics and destroys his foe.  It looks awesome, but you quickly learn that this ability makes it extremely easy to fight nearly anything.  It also makes the game feel like its playing on autopilot and you are just a bystander watching.So this is a review for those interested in Twilight Princess.  Whether your itching for a Zelda fix while waiting for TP or have played and enjoyed TP and want more Zelda, I've just gotta warn you that Wind Waker is not worth the trouble.
This is one of the worst RPG's ever in existance. Besides being easy, it also has an unoriginal plot and crap graphics. I think the Atari 2600's system is more advanced than this game. I mean, what's an RPG without scantly clad women? This RPG has none, except for a princess who is as clothed as a fememist is. And Mallow and Geno are loaded with fail, and I don't see why people want them in Smash Brothers, which is a crap game as well. The plot tries to be all original by not centering on Bowser kidnapping and raping Peach, who is called Toadstool for whatever reason, but on some character named Smithy who is trying to take over the world by getting stars. Whatever. And the battle system is awful as well. I mean, timed hits?For a good Mario game, play Mario is Missing!, Mario's Time Machine, or the CDI classic, Hotel Mario. If you want a good RPG, for the SNES, play Dungeon Master of Final Fantasy Mystic Quest. the graphics suck, boring game

This is very disturbing gameyou control little monsters that go around and kill peopleplus they forgot the letter Zhorrible!
There is one reason why I give this game 1 star. Because of one reason...the game is creepy. Why is it creepy? If you are a smart gamer like me, you know most Wario bosses are disturbing. The bosses in this game give me NIGHTMARES!!!!!!!

Rent the game before you buy it! I know most people find the game funny and fun, but in truth, it is actually very disturbing. To me, at least. And it is so sad to see a funny game have a sad ending.

stopped playong just got bored
I only played this game for 2 days,it is boring and my dog was an idoit sometimes.
This was fun for a while but it really is a one note game. It goes no where.
We did not like this version as much as some of the older Mario parties.
This game is Exactly like Tetris! So don't get this game.

Everything else is just a rotten imitation of that fine game.  The graphics are well drawn, but poorly animated.  The music is lame.  The story is weak, and worst of all, the play controls are horrendous.The ring menu system from &quot;The Secret of Mana&quot; was a thing of beauty that let you quickly use items and equip your characters.  &quot;Sword of Mana&quot; has ring menus as well, but they're sluggish, and they flash for no apparent reason.  Also, it seems like it takes forever for the guy to swing his sword after you have pressed the button.  If you play it with the GameCube GameBoy Player, you'll even notice a bit of flicker.Another minor irritation is that no matter what kind of creature you kill, it leaves behind something that looks like a bull skeleton.  I could understand that in 1992, but it's 2003!  Surely ROM is cheap enough by now for the cartridge to hold an assortment of remains.I doubt that the original Mana team even worked on this thing.  In the opening, it mentions Brown &amp; Browne, which makes me suspect that Square is just a publisher for this game, not a developer.  They pulled the same dirty trick with &quot;Breath of Fire&quot; which was an okay game developed by Capcom, but it was not as good as a Square game.If they couldn't be bothered to do it right, they shouldn't have done it at all.

Don't get me wrong, I love this game. So why do I give it a bad overall score?

This game is not anything like we thought it would be after reading the reviews. Gamepaly is sluggish and boring and little ones will find it hard to play. Sorry I bought this one!

I don't want to spend a lot of time and space on "Super Mario Bros. 3" specifically, but instead focus on this port (which is based on the "Super Mario Allstars" version).  We all know "Super Mario Bros. 3" is a classic title.  So, let's dispense with the cursory introduction of "Super Mario Bros. 3".  Basically, this is just a copy and paste job from a short blurb I wrote in my 2004 review of "Super Mario All-stars"."SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 3: The best selling game ever released independently, SMB3 greatly expanded the Mario universe with the introduction of several new enemies, Bowser's children (who was the mother, I wonder? Godzilla's ex?), and introduced cool new suites for Mario to wear. The game play was more expansive than ever, with cool new secrets to discover and eight tremendously large worlds. This game laid the foundation for so many other plat-formers, especially SUPER MARIO WORLD. While SMB2 felt like a weird detour, SMB3 took Mario back to the atmosphere or the original game, taking it a thousand different directions, and coming up with one of the best games ever developed. Although there were a few tweaks for the ALL STARS release (some levels got a few more coins to make it easy to access game secrets), like the other games this is tremendously faithful to the original NES release. That alone makes this essential playing"To further elaborate, there are a few cosmetic changes, but this is largely the All-stars port of "Super Mario Bros. 3" that we all know and adore.  Ok, we all love SMB3?  It's an eternal classic, etc, etc. Best game on the NES. Yada yada.  Everyone on the same page?  Good.Now, let's get to the problems of "Super Mario Advance 4", and yes, there are problems.  Well, one problem anyway.  And it's a BIG problem.  It's a little selling point called e-Reader compatibility.  What's so great about e-Reader cards you ask?  Well, I'm glad you asked.e-Reader cards features new content than can be added to pre-existing games.  In the case of "Super Mario Bros. 3", there were three specific types: Power-ups (which uploads specific items into Mario or Luigi's inventory list and can be used an unlimited amount of times), Demo Cards (which showed Mario speed-running, collecting enough coins to unlock a blue Toad House, or doing infinite 1-Up tricks - essentially, the hint videos of "New Super Mario Bros. Wii" six years before), and, wait for it . . . New Levels.Yes, you read right.  New levels.  Yes, Nintendo made NEW LEVELS to "Super Mario Bros. 3", and a whole new world called, appropriately enough, "World-e".  Note, these are not the 15 inaccesible levels embedded in the original NES "Super Mario Bros. 3" code. Nintendo released ten levels in Japan, the PAL reigion, and America, with two different series.  Fantastic, eh?  Awesome?No, not really.  In fact, as a Mario can you just feel cheated.  Why?  Well, for one, although Japan frequently gets exclusive content, Nintendo released a full TWENTY TWO additional new levels in Japan only, because (again, wait for it) . . . Nintendo discontinued the e-Card readerSo, what's frustrating here?  Mainly, Nintendo made THIRTY THREE NEW LEVELS (which, to put in perspective, is over a third of the original game, as "Super Mario Bros. 3" has 88 levels total), plus five re-made levels in "Super Mario Bros. 3" style of "Super Mario Bros.".  These were levels 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, and 2-1.  Also, in homage to "Super Mario World" there are five new coloured switches which effect gameplay in different ways, but again only were released in Japan.Although many think Boomerang Mario first appeared in "Super Mario 3D Land", actually he first appeared in these one-off levels on the e-Cards, but (with only one exception, "Slidin' the Slopes", where you can use a boomerang on that one level only, just like Goomba's Shoe on 5-3) no one outside of Japan got to play as Boomerang Mario.  2/3s of the e-cards appeared only in Japan.Another problem with the e-Cards?  In World-e, there are three mushroom houses, each featuring three specific mini-games.  To unlock these mushroom houses, you must get Advance Coins found in the new levels (a precursor to the Star Coins of the "New Super Mario Bros." series).  But here's the kicker.  Outside of Japan, there's only enough coins to access ONE of these three mini-games, because there's not enough currency in the ten levels that Nintendo actually did release to unlock the other two.In Europe, the gamers got screwed even worst than the Americans, with the e-Card functionality completely disabled, inaccessible through normal gameplay.For Mario fans, this is beyond disappointing.  Nintendo put so much effort into new content, and yet do to poor implementation the majority of gamers will not get to experience these fantastic levels.  The e-reader was also a failure, so the cards weren't available for very long anyway.  Had all this new content been released in the game proper, "Super Mario Advance 4" would be the definitive port of "Super Mario Bros. 3"; as it stands, there is only a vague sense of disappointment and incompletion for those who know about the new content.These are the true Lost Levels in the Mario universe, still commercially unreleased and widely difficult to play legitimately.  Note that the original "Super Mario Bros." had 32 levels.

El juego para multi jugador de las campanas es muy bueno, muy divertido. Pero los otros juegos de m&uacute;sica no son tan emocionantes, tanto que los ni&ntilde;os r&aacute;pidamente dejaron de jugarlo. Actualmente cuando lo colocamos solo jugamos las campanas. Mis dos hijos est&aacute;n en lecciones de guitarra y piano, esperaba entonces que este juego complementara sus lecciones para desarrollarles de alguna manera el sentido musical, pero el juego es muy aburridor.
este es sin duda el peor de los 3 smash bros que han salido,inclusive es igualito al super smash bros melee osea no mejoraron en nada,mejor me quedo con smash bros de nintendo 64 que si es un juego de primera.
For roughly the same price, you could get Super Mario Bros. Deluxe, it plays on all Game Boy systems, and has everythign this game has plus a lot more. Does this game have Super Mario Bros. 2 hidden in it? No. Does it have a calendar? No. Mini games? No. You're much better off with Mario Bros. Deluxe.

Didn't tell me it was a Europe download ticket code and couldn't be used in the US even though shipped to New Jersey
If you want to buy the Wii Fit and Balance board at any price, go for it.  However, be aware that MSRP is $89.99.  Patience and a bit of detective work should allow you to get one from K-Mart, Sears, Wal Mart or Target.
Wow, so much hype from everything I read and all for nothing. Sin and Punishment is listed by multiple reviewers as being intense, insane, NON-STOP WTFBBQ! awesome. In reality, you hold down the b-button the entire time while occasionally using the nun chuck to evade the seriously impossible.++++: If you are a die hard Sin and Punishment fan or a living on the rails kind of shooter go for it!----: Another piece of bloatware for the Wii novelty.This is especially not any fun co-op as the second person literally isn't in the first stage, then just holds down the b-button from then on.I fought Rodan but never saw Godzilla! BOOOO!Cut scenes are horrendous along with the plot... which you would only understand if you played the first Sin and Punishment
It was not a good remake and I'd rather play the original then the remake. Overall, I rate this game 1/5. the graphics suck, boring game
