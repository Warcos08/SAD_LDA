Every once in a while I experience a piece of entertainment that is *so* overrated it's hard to believe I'm even living on the same planet as those that actually believe this is supposed to be the best. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is that very piece of overrated entertainment. Talk about a video game that not only doesn't live up to the hype (not even close) but it doesn't do a darn thing to impress me even *if* I were to ignore all the exaggerated hype. This is a serious letdown of a video game. But again, please understand I'm not from the same planet as those that enjoy this game. I care about gameplay and replay value more than anything else. Apparently most Zelda fans believe puzzle-based dungeons and soulless overworlds are what defines the Zelda series.One thing that positively stinks is that the land of Hyrule, despite being presented as beautiful (and realistic- don't tell me Nintendo wasn't riding the 3D high in 1998 and going for realism here) it's basically a gigantic piece of nothingness. Simply a means of getting from one area to another. A large, colorless empty field that Link either runs or rides his horse across. Nothing magical, medieval or interesting about *any* of this. It feels too much like taking a typical walk across the field beside my house. Going into this game after a Link to the Past, you'll be scratching your head wondering what happened to the huge variety of overworld enemies, pretty and colorful environments and enticing obstacles. Remember all those trees, rocks, grass and water sections from Link to the Past? Remember how rich and vibrant they looked? Ha, nothing nearly as diverse is featured in this bland and inferior overworld. Oh sure the monsters come out at night (in predictable spots) but that's it. As far as I can see, only one monster actually comes out (named Stalchild). Terribly lacking. The trees are spaced apart in a way that feels lacking too.The dungeons is where this game severely misses the mark to such an extent that it's almost unfathomable to believe Nintendo thought releasing the game the way it is was enough to be sufficient. Again, where ARE all the enemies? Why am I roaming through temple rooms that are way too big for their own good? Are high ceilings and deep pits supposed to justify the lack of enemies because the tradeoff is that it feels like I'm really inside a castle now? Give me a break guys. The rooms are so big they basically have no life whatever. Instead of being loaded with enemies around every corner, these castles are alarmingly empty, lifeless and unacceptable. But... that's apparently okay, because Ocarina of Time is the first 3D Zelda game so its legendary influence and innovation makes it leaps and bounds above the sequels, right? Not in my world baby. The games following Ocarina of Time perfected the Zelda formula way more effectively. Wind Waker and Skyward Sword leaves this dated mess in the dust.While normally I don't care about graphics in a video game, you gotta admit that bright vibrant colors really make the epic heroic adventurous theme of the Zelda series more engrossing. This is just... gross. Only the realistic-looking (flawed) overworld is a sight to behold (which of course now looks significantly better in Twilight Princess). Clearly the effort involved in designing the dungeons isn't much to admire. I don't really mind the occasional choppiness concerning the edges of buildings, trees or other objects that are all part of the Nintendo 64's datedness. Sometimes these unintentional features can be quite charming or, at the very least, forgiving. What I DO mind however is when these features are all over the place to the point of being a distraction, or having a game entirely too long so we're forced to persevere these issues time and time again. In other words I'd be willing to forgive this particular shortcoming if the game made up for the choppy/uninspiring graphics in other areas. Sadly, it doesn't. This isn't even much of an issue compared to the other complaints I have (which I'll mention below- keep reading). These graphics -especially the ones in the dungeons- resemble the ones found in the ruins of Mega Men Legends and the walls of the Quake series. The graphics in Link to the Past are unique and cannot be compared to any other game.Let's discuss the dungeons, shall we? Despite being ridiculously and needlessly large with boring surroundings, most of them have such a small and uninteresting variety of enemies that it's almost a chore going through one generic room after another. Ocarina of Time shows the makings of early 3D development at its most obvious- the platforms are predictable square structures that requires the player to spend most of his or her time lining up Link in order to make proper jumps by turning the camera until Link is positioned enough to reach the platform directly ahead. When you combine the constant requirement of having to change camera angles with having to position Link correctly all for the purpose of being able to see what you're doing and where you're going, it's enough to make you think you're playing with string puppets. Again, early 3D design flaws and datedness.The storytelling is really basic and predictable. It's never elaborate like in Wind Waker or Skyward Sword. It's mainly about rescuing or saving these mountainous cave creatures called Goron's for the first half, and going back and forth from the past to the present in the second half. This is a really uninteresting way of time travelling that feels almost nonexistent due to being so poorly and unsatisfyingly implemented. It doesn't even feel or look like you're going 7 years into the future as Link's appearance is supposed to be that of an older person but he doesn't appear to be much different from his younger self. Oh sure he's slightly bigger as an adult and slightly smaller as a kid but it's very subtle. The music is the one area where the game succeeds quite amazingly however. All the theme songs are not only appropriate for the environments, but melodic and memorable. Several dungeon themes are well-made and believably chilling and haunting. The right ingredients were definitely put into the music-making aspect of the game. The Hyrule overworld theme is enjoyable too and won't get on your nerves despite all the time you will undoubtedly spend there.The dungeons are either incredibly simplistic with strategies that involve the overbearingly dull and overused crate-pushing to open up portals or switches, or hopelessly generic "I'm stuck in a maze and I can't get out" frustration that is an inconvenient trademark of early 3D game design. But... these aren't any ordinary mazes. These are mazes where your surroundings look identical around every turn, hence the flawed early 3D game design. A cheap way of making a maze seem more difficult than it has to be, or in other words, needlessly difficult chores instead of exciting castle exploration which is what made the 2D Zelda's so memorable. Sometimes you have to light torches with arrows or by other means, and quite often you have to collect 5 silver rupees to activate a switch/open a door. Collecting these silver rupees is WAY too similar to Super Mario 64 with the red coins. The Lost Woods is a tunnel-infested maze with no personality whatsoever. The Lost Woods -if you plan on getting everything the game has to offer- will most definitely be the source of endless frustration.The enemies, or rather, what little enemies you will stumble upon on your "adventure" through the temples, is probably the most aggravating part of the entire game. These dungeons are sorely in need of something to spice them up and make them pleasurable. You will often go 3 or 4 rooms at a time without seeing a single enemy. Why even have a sword? In the 2D games the idea was simple- just load or overload the rooms with a variety of enemies and, guess what? *Now* the dungeons are exciting. A genius idea really. Here? In Ocarina of Time? It's all about atmosphere. It's all about featuring as little opposing danger as possible so you can absorb what was once Nintendo's most recent creation back in 1998. But... Nintendo forgot to take into account that technology will inevitably advance and a game relying on atmosphere above everything else will eventually suffer and become inferior one day. What was once a brand new puppy in 1998 is now a tired old dog thanks to the surroundings being boring and incredibly basic in their design. Video game technology is destined to advance making a game like this completely forgettable. That's exactly what has happened with Ocarina of Time- it hasn't stood the test of time.Do you really think those poorly animated mechanical blue tektite spiders in the water dungon are worthy of a Zelda game? Seriously? Their animations are so stiff due to the Nintendo 64's limitations as a console that it's unbearable to deal with them and laughable at the way they lunge towards Link. But even then, *most* dungeon enemies fall way short of acceptable. Big Skulltula is a laughably bland attempt at being dangerous- it's more like a nuisance when one of these comes down out of nowhere while you're running around. The spikes that roll around are incredibly basic and uninteresting. Somehow *all* the enemies manage to never once be memorable. Ever! Ocarina of Time has dated horrendously, seriously. Wolfos are unintetionally funny with their choppy movements and the dated howling sounds they make, Red Bubble is basically the same thing as Big Skulltula but on fire, and Gibdos are boring. The ReDead's let out a hilarious scream that freezes Link in place which is inconvenient when you're trying to get up the ladder right in front of you and even more inconvenient when you're stuck in a room with two of them. Mummies are poorly designed since all you have to do is hookshot them, run behind them, and slice them with your sword. To be fair, some enemies are cool such as Deku Baba where it's best to snap its vine with the sword for an instant kill- creatively well done there. The Deku Scrub where you can block or sword swipe its shooting seeds with the shield and ricochet the seeds back at them is neat. And the Lizalfos and Dinalfos basically serve as mini bosses due to being somewhat harder and more sophisticated than the other ordinary enemies.The game overall has a shortage of rupees. They're really not that important which is odd. This is the first Zelda game I've ever played where rupees feel more like an afterthought. Not something to take real seriously. If you don't feel like collecting them, then don't- no harm done. The bosses are alright except for the irritating one in the water dungeon. You have to repeatedly hookshot him while standing next to the platform. It takes FOREVER (and no, this boss is *nowhere* as fun as the water dungeon in Link to the Past in case you're wondering). The hookshot is used MORE than the sword throughout the game because it serves as an effective weapon quite often. The hookshot is a highly recommended weapon to use in a variety of situations, but especially important when collecting these things called gold skulltulas. After you collect 10 gold skulltula tokens, you get a beneficial reward. You can only collect them after defeating the gold skulltula enemy (usually found on walls). I admit I love the witches you face in the Spirit Temple. While the temple itself is really short and boring, it's probably worth going through it so you can face the two witches that make for a rather entertaining boss fight. You have to use your shield to reflect shots at the *other* witch, and it's really fun and creative. The hookshot's basically a required item to properly deal with hard-shelled or spiked enemies in the dungeons and it's annoying that it's used WAY more frequently than the sword throughout the game. Due to how much precision is required to use the hookshot, using this item becomes a very tedious chore after a while (especially if you keep missing your target) and it slows down the pace of the game by a lot.If you haven't noticed yet, the water dungeon in Ocarina of Time is just abominable. I bring it up often to remind people how terrible a dungeon can be in every possible way. Also, the worst influence ever occurs here- the importance of playing the ocarina musical instrument for a variety of reasons (mostly for warping from one place to another). Nintendo really overdid this aspect of the game by implementing the ocarina WAY too many darn times. It's overdone. Just hurry up and play the darn song and move on for goodness sake. Don't make it so you have to play the ocarina up to 50 times, if not more. I never really counted how many times I used it. It was a lot. It severely drags the gameplay, atmosphere and excitement down and immediately drags the game to a screeching halt having to frequently stop and play these songs on the ocarina. Watching Link stand around and play the instrument is the fruitiest thing I've ever seen. No wonder people think Nintendo makes nothing but kids games these days. This game is partly responsible for that belief due to its influence.Ganon's castle is supposed to be exhilarating and suspenseful. It's supposed to be filled with dangerous traps, tricky puzzles and enemies all over the place. But... the one in Ocarina of Time falls way short of being presentable by normal Legend of Zelda standards. Instead the castle is dominated with mini quests where you have to go through 6 trials to dispel the main barrier. The problem is that each trial contains really simple and short rooms where you only spend a couple minutes in each one performing the same tasks that you already had to do in the previous dungeons such as collecting 5 silver rupees. This is the complete opposite of being overwhelmingly threatening. Another bonus point for Link to the Past. Oh and the Ganon fight? His strategy is stolen from Agahnim's battle from Link to the Past but takes SEVERAL more minutes to bring down. Remember how you fought Agahnim? Yup, same exact strategy but in a 3D world. Sigh. The second part of the Ganon fight (after a looooong and tedious time-based departure from the top of a castle) is to shoot arrows at Ganon and hit his glowing behind several times. It's really easy, all of it. However fighting him in one of the early dungeons (Forest Temple) is actually one of the most memorable in the entire Zelda series. This is because Ganon rides a horse in and out of these picture frames hanging on the wall making for a VERY unique graphics effect and perhaps an original concept. Reminds me of a Harry Potter movie.A few other complaints. Fishing is sort of fun but nothing really noteworthy. It's better than most fishing games I've played in other games I admit. Expect to be sitting and fishing a while in order to get the heart piece however. Most heart pieces are pretty challenging to acquire and take some serious effort to get most of them. That's a rare compliment I can give. Some of the other mini games such as riding a horse and shooting targets is pretty fun. I don't really like that part in the desert where you have to follow a ghost through a dust storm. If you fall behind even a *little* bit you'll lose. Performing this same ghost-chasing task earlier in the game in order to obtain the hookshot is more exciting since you're dodging fireballs. The other task earlier on in the game in the Ice Cavern that involves throwing blue fire over red fire is really overlong and entirely puzzle-based. Having to do this once or twice would have been suitable- not 15-20 times. This particular place is a victim of platforms that are basic and uninteresting.Basically, when compared to the 2D games, Ocarina of Time only feels like half a game due to the dramatic change of turning the Zelda series into 3D but only giving us a small portion of what's available in Link to the Past. As a result the game feels incomplete on too many occasions. It's because the Nintendo 64 is a limited console that's really only able to handle so much. Ocarina of Time comes up way short. Even the first couple hours are disappointing since it takes forever to actually get going. Avoiding being detected by guards isn't fun after the first time. Oh and speaking of avoiding detection- this game actually has a Metal Gear Solid stealth-style mission later on where you have to free these imprisoned carpenter people. The stealth is so underutilized and simplistic that this is the second biggest chore in the game next to the water dungeon. Equally annoying is upon freeing the 4 carpenters, these red sword-swinging enemies appear on screen. The SAME EXACT ENEMY 4 times in a row with *no* differences between any of them. At first these battles seem hard until you realize all you really have to do is lunge your sword directly at them about 5 times, and they fall over and die.Reading text and having boring discussions with Zelda, trees and other semi-interesting characters doesn't get the job done either. Ganon even seems significantly less threatening than usual (that one conversation with Zelda and Link with Ganon patrolling the hallways nearby in Hyrule Castle comes to mind here). I will admit that some of the flame-covered cutscenes involving Ganon riding his horse is very intimidating. The cutscene outside the bridge of Hyrule Castle comes to mind here. Otherwise, Ganon's presented uninterestingly. You're *supposed* to get a feeling of hopelessness that Ganon is going to take over the world and wipe the people out but... due to a culmination of the above mentioned problems, Ganon being a ruthless villain doesn't ever materialize (at least, he's not as scary as he *should* be).Recognize Ocarina of Time for making the 3D Zelda series exist. That's fair. It allowed Wind Waker to eventually be created which in turn made the 3D Zelda formula better starting from that game until now. By 2003 Nintendo was working with the technologically superior Gamecube console which allowed the Zelda series to be fully realized in all major categories (gameplay, graphics, replay value and excitement). I say avoid Ocarina of Time but hey, nobody will listen or agree with me anyway so carry on and have a wonderful day!
Let me preface this review by saying that I'm a Nintendo and Zelda fan. I have played all the Zelda games except for the CD-i games, and have beaten "Ocarina of Time", "Wind Waker" and "Twilight Princess". When 3DS was released in North America, I did not get it on day one, but I did get it on day three, and when "Ocarina of Time 3D" was released, I beat it three times, one for each save file you get. I had to delete a save file to play it a fourth time.You are probably thinking that a main-series, console Zelda release can never be less than gaming perfection. However, I would beg to differ, pointing you to "Zelda II: The Adventure of Link". "Skyward Sword" is the second coming of "Zelda II" in that respect, and it has done the unthinkable and finally supplanted it as the most disappointing Zelda game of all time. If you have not played this game, you have no idea how terrible it is, so before you judge this review and vote it down, I implore you to read this review and other "negative" (I prefer the term "honest") reviews before making your own decision about purchasing this game. Nintendo has really dropped the ball with this game. The release of the MotionPlus accessory never really generated the second life for the Wii that they intended, so they forced it into a traditional core gaming franchise and the result is "Skyward Sword".The controls are very bad. Almost every action involving the Wii remote is filled with frustration and stress - from flying to just simply trying to cut grass. Very early on, you get a taste of flying. However, the controls are overly sensitive, yet unresponsive at the same time - the worst of both worlds. For example, you will tilt the controller to the left to turn left, but there will be slight lag until your bird actually turns. To make up for this lag, you will be tilting the controller even more than necessary. By the time you do this, your bird finally has turned, but the extra turning you have done to compensate for the lag has made the bird turn even more than necessary. It's not just the lag that accounts for the bad controls, either. It is just too sensitive. A slight tilt of the controller will cause it to turn a lot, and there is no way to adjust the sensitivity. This is not how we were taught how to fly in real life, or in video games. Flying by tilting a horizontally-aligned controller is simply unintuitive.The sword-controls are terrible as well. Cutting grass - something that has been a staple of the franchise since "Link to the Past", is now needlessly difficult. In Twilight Princess, one could simply shake the controller, and Link, your on-screen avatar, would effectively cut grass. In this game, simply shaking the controller is not enough; oh no. You must be precise and shake it horizontally, because grass grows vertically, and thus to cut it, you must chop it horizontally. Now this would not be that big of a deal if when every time or at least 90% of the time you performed a horizontal slice with your controller, Link did the same. However, this is not the case. Also, every little, seemingly innocuous enemy in the game now has become a mini-boss encounter, where precise timing and sword strokes are needed for victory. This is an extrinsic vicissitude for the Zelda series. It slows the gameplay down, and breaks up the pacing.Here are some more examples of the horrible controls:This is not so egregious in execution, but is in theory: walking across a tightrope. When Link walks across a tightrope, he will alternately teeter to the left and right - not because you are failing to hold the controller steady, but because Nintendo programmed him to do so. At first, I was wondering why I was teetering to the left and right when I was holding the controller steady. Then I realized that instead of programming tightrope sequences so that Link's movement intuitively mirrored the player, as in all the other actions, like flying and sword-swinging, they repudiated that philosophy for this one type of event, making the player react to Link's movements, rather than the other way around. This makes no sense in the commonsense, logical desire of having one theoretical, uniform game design philosophy.In another example of paradoxical, inconsistent game design philosophy, the "Sheikah Stone" makes a reappearance. It made its first appearance in "Ocarina of Time 3D", and it gives players hints when consulted. One of the caveats of this tool is that it is only accessible on Skyloft, the main hub area. The inclusion of the "Sheikah Stone" baffles me to a certain extent. I can see how this will help the more casual gamers, but when the controls are unresponsive, rendering the game difficult beyond the reach of casual gamers, I do not see the point of its inclusion. My point is that a "Sheikah Stone" should have been the last thing on Nintendo's list of considerations. Their priority should have been to fix the controls, and then a "Sheikah Stone" would have been unnecessary.Killing skulltulas is another thing that has been greatly overcomplexified. In "Ocarina of Time", killing skulltulas had a short learning curve, but it was understandable and intuitive: if you got too close, it faced you constantly, rendering it invulnerable to your sword. If you got too far from it, it retreated beyond your reach. At just the right distance, it would first drop down and then turn around, exposing its vulnerable underbelly for a brief moment, giving you an opportunity to strike. In "Skyward Sword", however even after much trial and error, I could not figure out how to defeat one. I soon ventured forth into the internet in search of a method, and was satisfied when I realized that I was not alone in my troubles. Of course, I also found snarky simpletons who, instead of helping people like me, proceeded to insult them for lack of "skill" and took their skulltula-killing troubles as an offensive gesture to their beloved God and king: the almighty Nintendo.One of the most egregious vicissitudes in "Skyward Sword" is save-points. Their philosophy was probably twofold: 1) it is not just a save point - you can do some other stuff, like taking to the skies, and it serving as a waypoint as well, and 2) maybe they found that people did not know how to save in Zelda games so they included save-points. The first reason is understandable - adding functionality. The second reason, however, is egregious. In other Zelda games, you can save nearly anywhere. You may not start at that exact location when you turn the system off and return, but your progress will be saved. In "Skyward Sword", you must first find a save point, and then when you want to stop playing and save, you must either keep playing and hope to find a save-point, or return to a save point you have already found and then save, wasting time that did not need to be wasted. This is an example of removing functionality: a bad thing.Navi-itis returns. You remember how annoying Navi was in "Ocarina of Time"? Well, the spiritual successor is here. I won't spoil anything but I will warn you that if your shield is about to break (yes, shields can break in this game - how asinine is that?), or even if you are low on hearts, this Navi-wannabe will annoy you. I think that the traditional pinging sound that was there from "Zelda 1" tells me all I need to know about how low on hearts I am!Nintendo seems to be feeling the pressure of being more like "Monster Hunter". They have unnecessarily added millions of little knick-knacky materials to collect through the course of your playthrough. These materials can be used to upgrade your items. This is not too bad, since it's optional, but when you come across a material, for example: a feather or a skull, the game must go into an animation of Link holding it up, then it tells you what it is, and then it goes into the menu, showing you how many of it you have. Then, you must exit the menu, if you want to keep playing. Every time you turn off your Wii or quit a play-sesion and then come back to play, if you find something for the first time for that playthrough, it does this again. It's unnecessary and annoying. The same thing happens for the higher-echelon rupees. At least it doesn't do it for blue rupees (worth 5) anymore like in "Twilight Princess".Another thing Nintendo has unnecessarily adopted into its game is a partial form of "floating combat text". In many other traditional RPGs, when you hit something or it hits you, numbers pop up indicating damage done or dealt. In this game, when you get hit, the same thing happens, but with hearts (e.g. if you lose two hearts, in addition to losing two hearts on your life meter, a "- [heart icon][heart icon]" will appear next to it). This is unnecessary and insults the player's intelligence. If I had five hearts and something hit me, and I now have three hearts, I can do the math and figure out that I lost two. I don't need the game to show me.Nintendo knew this game was hard. At first I was taken aback at how Link started off with six hearts. Usually he starts off with three, no? Then I played the first dungeon. "Oh... That's why."Not all is bad in "Skyward Sword", however. Theoretically, I like the idea of taking a Zelda game into the sky, like how "Wind Waker" was an entire Zelda game built around the theme of wind and the ocean. Also, the new stamina-meter, which I disliked at first, grew on me, and I learned to appreciate it. For example, Link can now move faster than his run (let's call the faster run a "sprint") without having to roll around all over the place, and he can run into a wall at this speed without bumping into it and subsequently falling down, for the "roll" has been remapped to the nunchuk's accelerometer. To roll, all one has to do is sprint and then shake the nunchuk.A new Zelda game wouldn't be complete without some new puzzle-types. I liked moving the key around with the controller to fit into a lock, although it featured reverse controls (up is down, left is right, etc.). In this respect, it does a good job of creating some new puzzles. Incremental challenge is a good thing, as long as the controls don't get in the way of it. As you now know, however, it does get in the way of it. After getting through the first two dungeons, I realized that the most difficult small-fry enemy was one of the first ones you meet: the piranha-plant thingies. This is an example of incorrectly increasing the difficulty of a game.Also of positive note: the "Deku Leaf" makes a return, although it is called the "Sailcloth" now. Functionally, it works the same as the "Deku Leaf". Unfortunately, this welcome return is simultaneously met with an unwelcome alteration in the controls. This item is controlled with the "Wii Remote Plus", and, you guessed it, the controls are terrible. Near the beginning of the game, you must use this item to land on a small circle on the ground. I tried at least 20 times before I was able to land on it. Eventually, I realized that the less you moved the controller, the better off you were. You were not controlling the game; you were simply giving the game the input it desired to perform the output you wanted. This is a big change from how most video games are designed. Most video games empower the player and give them the illusion that they're imposing their will upon the game. "Skyward Sword", on the other hand, forces you to play by its rules and molds the player into its own, unwilling pawn. Maybe that's why some people like this game. They are unknowingly pawns and tools in the universe, and thus enjoy or are used to being in this position in the world.I found that the most effective way of fighting the Bokoblins (red bad-guys) was not to swing the controller at their weak points but to wait for them to drop their guard, and in that second before they attack, you the player should strike quickly. Waiting for an opening? I understand using that philosophy for designing boss battles, but small-fry enemies should not have been designed like this.The graphics are a mixed bag. Sometimes, especially during cutscenes, I was impressed at what the Wii was capable of. I found myself thinking, "Is that FMV?" However, at other times, these times being most of the time, I found myself thinking, "This looks worse than 'Twilight Princess'." A lot of the animations and models seem to be ripped straight from that game, tweaked a negligible amount, and then daubed with a low-detail, saturated, faded-rainbow paintbrush. Everything looks washed-out and all the colors seem to bleed together, like a watercolor painting done by an elementary school student. It is hard to tell what is what from a distance. I know what Nintendo was thinking when they went in this artistic direction. They knew they could not compete graphically in the realism department with "Xbox 360" nor "Playstation 3", so they went in the opposite direction of accentuating their "superior" artistic vision, so that the Wii's graphical shortcomings would be ignored with a lush, unique, graphical style. However, it fails to deliver on its intentions. I am not opposed to non-realistic graphics. Oh no. "Wind Waker" is one of the most beautiful games ever created, and looks miles better than this game. "Wind Waker" was designed to be a "cartoon that you play" - this coming straight from Miyamoto's own mouth, and I wholeheartedly agree. "Skyward Sword", on the other hand, feels like a rainbow threw up on a Miyazaki film. It just doesn't work. Also, why does Link have to look so much like Michael Jackson? Could he not have looked a little more human, and less extra-terrestrial? Nintendo got his face wrong in "Twilight Princess", right in "Super Smash Bros. Brawl", then even fixed "Twilight Princess" Link's face for the "Wii U" Zelda tech demo at E3 this year, but lost it again for Skyward Sword.The music is surprisingly bad as well. The soundtrack sounds less like a Zelda game, and more like a generic JRPG soundtrack. After looking up the credits online, I found that a whole stable of composers not named Koji Kondo was involved in it. "Ah..." My suspicions were correct.Nintendo needs to bring Miyamoto back to the director's chair. He understands that gameplay is paramount. When you first start up Skyward Sword, you are bogged down with cutscenes and meaningless fluff in the form of small-talk conversations with NPCs. You may have thought "Twilight Princess" got off to a slow start, but holy snap, "Skyward Sword" takes it to the next level. If the story and characters were half-interesting, maybe I would care, but unfortunately it is not. People play Zelda games for the gameplay, not the story and cinematic work.It is not the idea of motion-controls in a Zelda game that is the problem here. It is in the execution, which is very bad. If there is copious ambiguity whether my failure to succeed is because it is not what I am supposed to do (as in the proper method of solving a problem) or it is because the controls are not responding to what I want to do, it is a major problem. As the great James Rolfe (the "Angry Video Game Nerd") once said, the number one important thing about a game is "being able to ****ing play it". I would love to swing my controller and be able to hit the enemies in their weak-spots, quickly and deftly; however, this is not possible because of the horrible control-response. I would love to be able to quickly transition from a neutral state to a rolling state when dealing with bombs, and then dexterously aim it to my own choosing. Again, this is not possible because of the horrible controls. "Twilight Princess" was evidence of how motion-controls could enhance a game to make a game greater than the sum of its parts. "Twilight Princess" on the Wii was easily superior to the Gamecube version. "Skyward Sword", on the other hand, obtrudes the game with its motion-controls, effectively making a gamer lesser than the sum of its parts. I wish there was a Gamecube version of this game.Let me now discuss my rationale for giving it 1 star: If you mouse over the respective stars, from the fifth star to the first star (furthest to the right, to the star furthest to the left), the mouse-over descriptions are as follows: "I love it", "I like it", "It's OK", "I don't like it", and "I hate it"."I love it" would be something I would say about "Ocarina of Time", and I have thought it to myself, and have even said it out loud to my friend back in 1999 or 2000. These games leave you in awe, feeling like a kid again. Those memories of getting a brand-new game for Thanksgiving-break or Christmas and playing it after you rip through the plastic wrap come flooding back to you. "Super Mario 64" and "Twilight Princess" are more examples."I like it" would be something I would say about "Wind Waker". The art direction was revolutionary, but the gameplay seemed to be an incremental evolution from "Ocarina of Time". In other words, it was good, but it did not blow my mind. That is fine; not every game can blow your mind."It's OK" is something I would say about "Metroid Prime". I was never a big fan of the Metroid series, but I did give Metroid Prime a shot and eventually beat it, but sometimes people have different tastes. These tastes are not meant to offend anybody."I don't like it" would be something I would say about "The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion". It did not do much for me, coming from an MMORPG like "World of Warcraft" and trying to capture that magic in single-player form; I have since yet to find a single-player RPG that has really kept me engaged for as long as an MMORPG. I rue the day I ever bought that game (WoW); it spoiled me. Still, I would not say that I hate Oblivion, because there is nothing fundamentally flawed about it; it's just ugly, boring, and not for me."I hate it" is not something I say often about video games. I do my research and I have a sixth sense when it comes to buying games and it does not involve internet game-reviews. But when a game is this fundamentally flawed, as in the controls don't work (forget about the design, which is secondary), we have a problem. The only thing I can compare "Skyward Sword" to off the top of my head is a really difficult NES game that is cheap (by cheap, I mean the AI is cheap) beyond imagination and is likely to have been reviewed by James Rolfe. Indeed, whilst playing "Skyward Sword", I found myself thinking and saying out loud many of his epithets like "What were they thinking?" and "This game is horrible!" I know there is a "first impressions" video on cinemassacre.com regarding this game, but it was made not by Rolfe, but by his friend Mike Matei. I would like to hear Rolfe's own opinions about this game.This has been the most disappointing holiday game lineup in recent history - from the overhyped "Battlefield 3", the most iterative game of all time: "Modern Warfare 3", the still-ugly-with-terrible-melee-combat Skyrim... What in the world is going on? God save us all.
Update- July 21, 2013I'm playing this game again after many years and oh my, what a big disappointment.  It doesn't hold up at all!  A big name Zelda title is supposed to be the greatest day next to Christmas.  Wind Waker admittedly does a lot of things right but the trade off is that it does WAY more things wrong.  Where to begin with this mess...Let's begin with the dungeons.  All of them are boring and colorless in appearance, unnecessarily overlong and confusing to figure out.  It's not like in the 2D Zelda games where sword cutting action is combined with creative puzzles- THESE dungeons are 80% puzzles and 20% action.  Having to run through gigantic nearly-empty rooms with eerie music in the background doesn't qualify as epic either.  Nice try Nintendo.  The two dungeons that are most unforgivable are the water dungeon (Tower of the Gods) and the one that involves having to babysit... er, team up with a female bird lady character named Medli and help her through the dungeon (Earth Temple).  Even though Link and Medli work together, it still feels more like babysitting.  While the dungeon puzzles are honestly thought-provoking and you will feel a great sense of accomplishment upon figuring them out, these two dungeons are the reason I'm not going back to this game ever again.  Do you *really* want to persevere this kind of torture again?  These aren't the kind of puzzles you ever desire to repeat.  Not when they take forever just to get through.  Even if you were to attempt a speedrun through these dungeons, the tedious nature of grinding through puzzle after puzzle assures you won't be speedrunning at a pace you'd prefer.The water dungeon is probably the worse of the two, but then again, maybe not.  I wasn't stuck on it nearly as long as the Earth Temple but on the other hand, the obstacles I faced were probably a lot worse.  The best way to describe the dungeon is like this- the first half is occupied with flooded rooms where the water raises and lowers approximately every 10-15 seconds, and the second half is all about a series of tedious statue-pushing puzzles.  When I say the water goes up and down I mean exactly that- you have to *wait* for the water to rise or lower because Link will then be able to swim to a platform or room within reach.  This is all totally required on the part of the player if you actually want to complete the dungeon and of course, that's why you're playing the game.  You *have* to deal with the moving waters.  In one unbelievably horrific room, you have to light a torch and jump across a series of perfectly lined up crates floating on top of the water.  Oh but that's not all.  If you miss you'll jump in the water, which means your flame will go out and you'll have to re-light the torch and attempt to move across the crates once again.  And you have to line up the crates when the water temporarily recedes so there's a proper and accurate path for Link's jumping.  If not for Ocarina of Time's water dungeon, this would unquestionably be a STRONG contender for the worst dungeon ever made.The other dungeon I mention involves the female bird lady character (Medli) where you have to do a series of tedious tasks that involve lifting her up and carrying her around or she'll get stuck behind.  She's also often needed to pick up and fly around Link to high or faraway platforms/places, and the main theme seems to be taking your shield (or Medli's shield) and reflecting the light that shines through ceiling or wall cracks in order to break open more passageways, chests or secrets, giving you access to the next area.  Your shield is basically used as a weapon in these instances.  At first it seems creative but you have to do this same task over and OVER again, and since each room serves more as overlong puzzles, you'll be stuck in this castle for hours.  I guarantee it.  Wouldn't be so bad if the enemies (such as those high-pitched screaming skeletons that freeze Link in place) were more abundant instead of scarce.  The one thing that REALLY annoys me is that you have to play "melody commands" to activate Medli a certain way.  You have to do this so many times, not just here but throughout the game, that it totally overstays its welcome after a while.  It's out of place in a Zelda game.  Just because Link played the flute in the 2D games does NOT give Nintendo the right to stretch out this unbearable mini musical story for all its worth in the sequels.  Overdone, boring and unnecessary.  In the Wind Temple, you have to guide a little mechanical propeller-lifting chicken-like thing called Makar (at least, it *looks* like a skinned chicken don't you think?) to higher areas/platforms to activate blocks and other things.  The fun wears thin when the realization that you have to do this same task over and over creeps in.  A poor attempt at designing dungeons Nintendo.  Shame on you.You already know the next problem I'm going to mention since it's been said a thousand times by now.  The actual sailing to get from one island to another takes forever with little in the way of doing anything interesting along the way.  The sail boat moves incredibly slow, and even though sometimes you might talk to a helpful fish for advice and discover treasure chests full of rupees, trifocre charts/shards or heart container pieces along the way (and even a boring rupee-collecting mini game involving a boat race later on) none of these things make up for the tediousness of waiting... and waiting... and falling asleep!  and waiting some more, until your boat arrives to your destination.  Ugh.  You can control the boat anywhere you want but it's not like there's a whole lot to do.  I realize a lot of people dislike the bird flying in Skyward Sword because it takes a while to arrive to your desired island in that game as well, but at least it's more heroic, soaring and adventurous watching Link riding a bird and closing in on an approaching island.  Here... with a sail boat... it just doesn't deliver the same kind of excitement.  Though granted, the peaceful serenity of the nighttime sailing is pretty cool especially when you glance at the moon and stars above, and I even like when danger occasionally occurs (such as swarming sharks and cannonballs later on) because it adds a bit of suspense.  I mean you're on a mere sail boat and here comes danger!  This isn't as threatening of a situation as you might be thinking, however.Several of the errands you do in town are so bad it makes me crings just thinking about them.  Having to snap photos of a man and woman when they're together or when a man is putting mail in the town mailbox?  REALLY annoying.  Starting up a ferris wheel?  Delivering love letters to characters who don't even deserve to be loved?  Chasing school children in a hide and seek game so you can impress the school teacher who's nothing but a snotty high and mighty, unappreciative nobody?  She only cares about money and being glamorous and is someone that in reality I'd avoid like the plague!  The picture rearranging games you sometimes discover on the walls of one or two rooms are really annoying too and not worth the reward for completing them (50 rupees if I remember).  There's a few other instances of errand-related annoyances, some of which are requirements.  The one where you have to crawl through a series of crawl spaces in maze-like fashion is confusing since every room looks exactly the same but thankfully this area is short, and the other one where you have to figure out which doors with a flame above them leads to your prize at the end feels like yet another waste of time but, again, it's short.On the flipside, I can name three mini games that are awesome.  The auction bidding is the most noticeable one.  It's fairly realistic and pretty fun too, especially the tension you feel after you make a high bid and you nervously count down the seconds anticipating if anyone's going to top your bid.  The battleship mini game is really fun.  I could probably spend 30-45 minutes on this game alone.  The guy in charge of the battleship game is the worst human being I've ever seen in a Zelda game.  Completely unfunny.  And the leaf parachute game where the object is to float across the water and strategically use the tornadoes to elevate your height so you can reach the finish line is the best of the bunch.  These are really entertaining games.The boss fights are alright though most of them are quite easy to take down.  In fact other than Ganon, they're *all* easy to take down.  Maybe the strategies were fairly complex back in 2003, but these bosses are too simplistic and boring these days.  The one where you have to battle a gigantic bird on a rooftop is WAY too reminiscent of the Ridley fight from Metroid Prime.  Even his attack and flying patterns are similar.  The only difference is that you're using a sword instead of an arm cannon obviously since this is a Zelda game.  Ganon's first battle at the end of the game is basically a 3 dimensional version of the Moldorm worm from Link to the Past but a much faster and harder way of damaging.  This part of the fight offensively requires luck to defeat- just hope you'll be standing near Ganon's weak point ready to strike when he speeds by.  A final boss fight should always be strategic instead of lucky.  The cel-shading graphics were the topic of conversation back in the day but now they look sort of dark, uninteresting and overbearingly cutesy.  Link and Zelda have ugly eyes and heads, and their bodies aren't pretty either.  Some of the characters such as the pirate named Miss Tetra are really awesome, but fail in comparison to the greater variety and diversity that Link to the Past and Skyward Sword's character selection presents.  The Miss Tetra storyline takes a drastic horrible turn later on when... ugh.  I can't spoil it.  All potential pertaining to the pirate storyline falls apart once *this* happens.The enemy combat usually consists of being able to walk up to most armored guards/blob creatures (and a few others) and slash them to death with your sword.  Some of them require the leaf, bow and arrow or bombs to destroy however.  Even though dealing with them is really easy, we can't overlook that it's also *really* darn fun.  Usually the guards (Darknuts) don't pose much of a threat, but sometimes you will have to prepare to move Link out of the way of a lunging sword attack.  This is usually in the later half of the game.  It gets especially dangerous when there's 3 or more Darknuts on screen.  You may have to execute some stellar sword trickery to escape.  I LOVE that one super spin attack that enables Link to spin around with his sword like a hurricane for 10 seconds and basically eliminate a room full of problems, or at the very least severely damage everything in sight.  It's awesome.  Like I say above, the melody (button) commands are awful due to this being a requirement WAY too often.  You HAVE to do this in order to change the direction of the wind so your sail boat can reach the island of your choice.  Having to frequently command a melody to steer your sail boat to another direction/location gets boring after a while, and as I say above, doing it in the castles gets especially tiresome and reduntant.I like some of the items and weapons Link uses.  The rope is a nifty way of swinging across branches to reach high or faraway areas, and the leaf parachute offers a similar function.  I LOVE the impactful beauty and effects of launching ice and fire arrows at a target as well.  The bow and arrow is a dangerous weapon as you'd expect since it's Zelda where the bow and arrow has always been crucial for survival.  This weapon is especially helpful and frequent in Wind Waker it seems.  These items and weapons really bring out the adventurous surroundings.  The game is overall very generous with the rupees as well.  You'll be collecting them by the bucket load.  They have yellow and purple rupees which adds up your amount rather fast.  Silver rupees hidden in chests under the water can reward you with 200 rupees, and orange rupees give 100.  Red rupees are back (worth 20).  Blue and green ones too.  Insanely generous.  Unless you haven't been collecting them, you'll probably have close to 5,000 by the final dungeon.  The swinging of the sword flows remarkably well.  There's no confusion in how you want to attack an enemy either.  Your sword won't ever let you down in the heat of a battle, nor will Link's movements.  The game encourages you to walk right up to enemies and slice 'em up.  If you don't, well, they seem to back off and wander around the room for a while giving you plenty of time to make preparations for another attack.  Simply put, enemies usually aren't as relentless as YOU are which may be a good thing since it means the game is hardly ever overly difficult.What I HATE however is the overlong fetch quest concerning the triforce shards and the charts.  You have to find BOTH the charts and the shards in the open water which can take several hours of searching.  You'll be sailing around for a while, but an even bigger problem is that it's unnecessary to even *have* such a quest after all the hours of boat sailing that has already taken place by this point.  This entire quest is overkill and I despise it.  I'm not too crazy about having to re-fight the bosses again at the end of the game either.  This time the colors on screen change to black and white perhaps a way to make the adventure feel more intense, and when you land the final blow you're simply transported back to the dungeon to take on the next boss.  It's... strange to say the least.  There's no feeling of satisfaction when you defeat them once again.  Then again, like I say above, there's no feeling of satisfaction anyway due to the bosses being easy overall.  Though I suppose it works in a "reminiscing over previous encounters" kind of way which illustrates how far Link has come since his sister went missing/introduction of Miss Tetra near the beginning.Wind Waker encourages more exploring than sword combat, so be prepared to spend more time exploring for items and treasures and less time fighting.  This means exploring many and I mean MANY empty islands with nothing but grass, high cliffs and trees everywhere.  Many of these islands contain caves or holes where items and chests are hidden, some of which provide decent atmosphere I admit.  After all falling in a big hole and landing near streams and being surrounded by high mountains is a unique feeling of adventure.  However there are two particularly offensive rooms near the end of the game where you keep falling through hole after hole (about 30 of them total) fighting 90% of the enemy varities you've already encountered which may be cool and serves as a nice combat-oriented mission, but feels like a clumsy way of making up for the lack of combat you experienced up to this point.  Like Nintendo just tacked this section on to make up for the distinct lack of combat throughout the game.  I'd bet anything that these two parts of the game contain more than 50% of the enemies in the game overall.  Why not spread these enemies around the dungeons and the islands?The music however, is INCREDIBLE!  Perhaps the best soundtrack ever in a Zelda game.  The soothingly beautiful credits theme is amazing beyond description, but my favorite is the fast-paced Jethro Tull or Renaissance like theme music that plays whenever you arrive to a mini boss.  It's diverse enough to be classified as a progressive rock song, seriously.  Just LISTEN to how awesome it is!  Other songs are really melodic and fit in appropriately and excitedly with the heroic theme of the fairy tale locations the Zelda series is known for.  Oh and perhaps my favorite part of the game- the dramatic and uneasy music you hear whenever you encounter an enemy.  It's suspenseful and makes you feel paranoid, threatened and overwhelmed by the upcoming danger.  It's *awesome*.  There's even some perfectly utilized sound effects while this particular theme is playing giving off a feeling of mystery and uncertainty.  I don't particularly care for the annoying sounds Link makes though.  He should have remained silent.  At least we can breathe easy knowing the one ice section later on is short because Link sliding around sounds like a baby animal being massacred by a group of wild barbarians.  Oh and speaking of which, these ice and fire dungeons shouldn't technically be considered dungeons since they're only one or two rooms long.  It literally only takes 2 minutes to complete them.Overall, go with Skyward Sword for a better 3D representation instead.  That game better represents the Zelda formula on all counts especially graphics, storytelling and overall epicness (but not music though- Wind Waker takes the crown there).  Wind Waker just doesn't provide much in the way of substance or pacing.  The triforce chart/shard quest is a big, extremely overlong letdown almost making you not want to finish the game.  How many times have I wanted to give up on a Zelda game due to boredom?  Never before.  The islands should have been closer together too.  This would have helped trim down on the unnecessary length of the game.

There's no confusion in how you want to attack an enemy either.  Your sword won't ever let you down in the heat of a battle, nor will Link's movements.  The game encourages you to walk right up to enemies and slice 'em up.  If you don't, well, they seem to back off and wander around the room for a while giving you plenty of time to make preparations for another attack.  Simply put, enemies usually aren't as relentless as YOU are which may be a good thing since it means the game is hardly ever overly difficult.What I HATE however is the overlong fetch quest concerning the triforce shards and the charts.  You have to find BOTH the charts and the shards in the open water which can take several hours of searching.  You'll be sailing around for a while, but an even bigger problem is that it's unnecessary to even *have* such a quest after all the hours of boat sailing that has already taken place by this point.  This entire quest is overkill and I despise it.  I'm not too crazy about having to re-fight the bosses again at the end of the game either.  This time the colors on screen change to black and white perhaps a way to make the adventure feel more intense, and when you land the final blow you're simply transported back to the dungeon to take on the next boss.  It's... strange to say the least.  There's no feeling of satisfaction when you defeat them once again.  Then again, like I say above, there's no feeling of satisfaction anyway due to the bosses being easy overall.  Though I suppose it works in a "reminiscing over previous encounters" kind of way which illustrates how far Link has come since his sister went missing/introduction of Miss Tetra near the beginning.Wind Waker encourages more exploring than sword combat, so be prepared to spend more time exploring for items and treasures and less time fighting.  This means exploring many and I mean MANY empty islands with nothing but grass, high cliffs and trees everywhere.  Many of these islands contain caves or holes where items and chests are hidden, some of which provide decent atmosphere I admit.  After all falling in a big hole and landing near streams and being surrounded by high mountains is a unique feeling of adventure.  However there are two particularly offensive rooms near the end of the game where you keep falling through hole after hole (about 30 of them total) fighting 90% of the enemy varities you've already encountered which may be cool and serves as a nice combat-oriented mission, but feels like a clumsy way of making up for the lack of combat you experienced up to this point.  Like Nintendo just tacked this section on to make up for the distinct lack of combat throughout the game.  I'd bet anything that these two parts of the game contain more than 50% of the enemies in the game overall.  Why not spread these enemies around the dungeons and the islands?The music however, is INCREDIBLE!  Perhaps the best soundtrack ever in a Zelda game.  The soothingly beautiful credits theme is amazing beyond description, but my favorite is the fast-paced Jethro Tull or Renaissance like theme music that plays whenever you arrive to a mini boss.  It's diverse enough to be classified as a progressive rock song, seriously.  Just LISTEN to how awesome it is!  Other songs are really melodic and fit in appropriately and excitedly with the heroic theme of the fairy tale locations the Zelda series is known for.  Oh and perhaps my favorite part of the game- the dramatic and uneasy music you hear whenever you encounter an enemy.  It's suspenseful and makes you feel paranoid, threatened and overwhelmed by the upcoming danger.  It's *awesome*.  There's even some perfectly utilized sound effects while this particular theme is playing giving off a feeling of mystery and uncertainty.  I don't particularly care for the annoying sounds Link makes though.  He should have remained silent.  At least we can breathe easy knowing the one ice section later on is short because Link sliding around sounds like a baby animal being massacred by a group of wild barbarians.  Oh and speaking of which, these ice and fire dungeons shouldn't technically be considered dungeons since they're only one or two rooms long.  It literally only takes 2 minutes to complete them.Overall, go with Skyward Sword for a better 3D representation instead.  That game better represents the Zelda formula on all counts especially graphics, storytelling and overall epicness (but not music though- Wind Waker takes the crown there).  Wind Waker just doesn't provide much in the way of substance or pacing.  The triforce chart/shard quest is a big, extremely overlong letdown almost making you not want to finish the game.  How many times have I wanted to give up on a Zelda game due to boredom?  Never before.  The islands should have been closer together too.  This would have helped trim down on the unnecessary length of the game.
I'm pretty sick and tired of people calling Super Mario 64 a classic.  It's not.  Just because it's significant and influential in helping pave the way for future Mario titles doesn't mean Super Mario 64 is deserving of its classic status, or that it's any fun to actually play.  Super Mario Galaxy came along and pretty much improved every single aspect of Super Mario 64 so you basically no longer have to play this game other than to get a dated taste of mid 90's gaming history.  The only other possible reason someone would play Super Mario 64 is because they desperately seek open world exploration, and this is basically the only Mario platformer that can at least attempt to satisfy gamers with that particular appetite.  Not that I personally believe the game succeeds at the exploring aspect either.The biggest problem is that so much of the land you explore consists of emptiness.  Oh sure you'll see trees, ramps, castles, buildings, enemies such as goombas, chain chomps, badly and laughably animated thwomps lifting up and slamming down, pokeys, rolling boulders, and other things that have become a trademark of the Mario series, but the amount of items to find and collect is *extremely* limited to coins (both yellow and red ones) and the occasional power-up that enables Mario to either fly (which admittedly is pretty fun) or obtain the incredibly boring metal cap that makes Mario invincible.  An alternative to the starman perhaps, with lousy side effects (Mario can't jump as high or far while wearing the metal cap).When you're not experiencing the endless disappointment that is running across empty and boring lands and basically doing nothing but wasting time, you're jumping across a series of unspectacular and very ordinary-presented platforms over and *over* again.  This stuff seriously resembles a beginners course for developing platforms.  It's extremely basic game design.  The platforms are generic square-shaped tiles for you to jump across that quite often are all the same exact size.  It gets monotonous almost immediately.  Only unreasonable Nintendo fans would eat this stuff up, seriously.  Anybody else would obviously be able to detect flawed, repetitive gameplay.  The 2D Mario games move at such a swift pace that you don't even have time to stop and notice the platforms (unless you're an extremely slow gamer).  This is mainly because you don't have to stop and situate Mario a certain way for the purpose of making the perfect jump which is what severely ruins Super Mario 64's gameplay.  And don't EVEN say my skills are horrible when it's obvious through countless youtube videos that several gamers have the same exact issue.While I'm by no means someone who cares about the best graphics available, you gotta admit the ones here have dated horrendously with embarrassing blocky shapes pretty much occupying most areas of the game.  The buildings, water and trees in particular are just awful for the eyes.  Nothing appealing whatsoever about any of the graphics- even the bright inviting colors don't lure me in but rather rub me the wrong way and force some of us older gamers to recall the unpleasant days of Mario Paint.You have to collect 120 stars in order to complete the game 100% but guess what?  Many of the stars are flat out boring to collect due to being pathetically easy and basically being handed to you within minutes.  What kind of challenge is that?  The one where you have to swim around and open treasure chests in a certain order is baby-ish, and the one where you swim around collecting 8 predictably located red coins inside a basic building near the beginning of the game is offensive.  Or how about simply stomping a post into a ground to release a gate and thus, release the star?  Don't even *think* about mentioning the ones where you walk up to Toad and he simply hands you the star.  Granted, the game seems to always alternate easy star-collecting challenges with longer and more drawn out ones as a way to balance things out but that's the problem- the stars are either too easy or too long.  There is one star mission so awful it makes your inevitable death seem like something to anticipate- the one where you have to jump across a series of moving poles.  You have to jump at *just* the right moment while making sure you're positioned in the right spot.  This takes forever and is dreadfully annoying.Also, what's up with all the little baby games?  Grab a baby penguin and slide down a snowy hill?  Chase the bunny so he doesn't hop away?  These are not suitable for anyone who recalls the challenging portions of previous 2D gaming such as Super Mario Bros. 3 or Super Mario World (and yes, these bunny grabbing missions are flaws in Super Mario Galaxy too, in case you think I'm intentionally favoring Super Mario Galaxy for no reason).  At least the cannon-shooting parts are cool.  It's fun figuring out where to launch Mario so he can land safely on upper grounds.I can't help but feel the red star collecting is overrated.  When you collect red stars in Yoshi's Island, you feel like you're given a really elaborate and perfectly executed assignment since you also have to collect flowers and stars to 100% complete a stage.  It's a lot to do not to mention really darn exciting and satisfying once you've acquired all these items, and constantly keeps your attention span in check while searching for them.  Super Mario 64 basically takes that one red coin-collecting element of Yoshi's Island and makes it a main priority here.  You often have to collect 8 red coins per stage (opposed to 20 in Yoshi's Island) to obtain one of the 120 stars.  Ugh.But nothing NOTHING is worse than the fact you have to re-enter stages over and over again just to grab all the stars that are located throughout.  To me this is unquestionably lazy game design.  How can it be anything else?  Who in their right mind would actually *want* to keep going back to the same exact stage ad nauseam?  Super Mario World was guilty of this too granted but not NEARLY to this exaggerated extent.  A terrible idea that gives a false impression a game has replay value but it's exactly the opposite- once you go through the same stage a bunch of times and finally accomplish everything there is to offer, you won't want to repeat these same objectives ever again.  So... you probably won't want to play Super Mario 64 ever again.  Even worse- when you often have to search for 100 coins to obtain a star.  This can take up to 20 minutes and bore you the entire time.  Being forced to collect 100 coins is a lazy way of assuring gamers don't leave any stone unturned because you basically have to thoroughly search every nook and cranny of a stage to even *find* 100 of them.I also dislike how many of the classic enemies aren't included here such as the hammer brothers, buzzy beetles, bloopers, and cheep cheeps.  Even the koopa troopa is nowhere to be seen (well, other than that one race in the beginning).  You can ride a koopa shell like a skateboard but that doesn't count as an enemy appearance.  He's not a true enemy here.  Why is that?  Why not include all the familiar and well-loved enemies that have become a trademark to the Mario series?  They ruin the pirahna plants by the way.  Why is he sleeping?  Granted he comes alive when you get near, but it's a really weird concept.  At least Nintendo got the boos and haunted house right- a surprising and exciting maze-like high point of the game.  It's a lot of fun sorting through each room of the haunted house stages.  *That's* how you design a memorable stage.  Obviously if you weren't busy running around through several vast and average-designed empty fields of grass, there could have EASILY been room for the inclusion of more enemies.  Hey I'm all for open world exploration, but you have to actually fill in those areas with exciting, creative items that are both fun and rewarding to collect for the player, and enemies that present threatening encounters and a rush of excitement.  Simply throwing Mario into a big 3D world because it's his first grand 3D adventure truthfully isn't going to get the job done I'm afraid.  More needs to be done.Constantly having to rearrange the camera so you can see where you're actually going is a nuisance.  Nobody likes dealing with a camera while jumping around trying to play a video game, but granted, several games back in the mid to late 90's were guilty of the same camera problems since developers were still getting their feet wet so to speak, and figuring out the best way to help players accurately and conveniently see what's ahead.  Still, you'll lose more than a few lives due to bad camera angles in Super Mario 64.  I guarantee it.  One thing I *do* like about this game is how fast Mario runs.  It's a fast-moving game, which helps going from point A to point B more convenient. Also some of the wall jumps and triple jumps are fun to execute.  Reminds me of Super Metroid in that respect.  Yoshi is teased in this game (I won't spoil how) but he's not actually playable which doesn't make sense.  Why make an appearance if he's not going to be playable?The music is either extremely good (the brilliant peaceful moodiness of the water theme and the intimidating and exciting heavy metal-like Bowser fights) or downright horrendous (everything else, which consists of annoying nursery rhyme children's themes inappropriate and painfully skull-smashing for the rest of us).  I can't STAND the theme songs that play in Whomp's Fortress and Rainbow Ride- two unforgivable themes that make me want to smash my brains in whenever I play Super Mario Galaxy 2 where they return in all their overbearingly annoying glory.  Rainbow Ride in particular reminds me of a county hayride where kids ride around on tractors (not to mention the stage itself is extremely tedious and overlong).  The snowy mountain stage with the Italian accordion music is sickening and out of place.  Just mute the volume on your TV to make life easier for yourself.  The boss fights are incredibly simplistic- grab Bowser's tail, spin him around and toss him, or pick up/stomp other bosses.  Basic, boring stuff.A few stages that are actually fun include Lethal Lava Land where the platforms convincingly feel like an upgrade into the 3D world from the original Super Mario Bros. castle levels (not to mention better/more interesting use of platform jumping compared to the rest of the levels in SM64), Shifting Sand Land since it's packed with obstacles and enemies (and reasonably challenging overall), and Tall Tall Mountain's tricky climb to the top (involving a vine climbing portion).  In fact, to be fair, Tall Tall Mountain is one of the best levels ever in a 3D Mario game.  It's *that* good.  Bowser's castle levels are pretty solid as well, mostly due to the fast-paced nature of them.Several things feel tacky- the 1-ups and coins are small, dark, ugly looking, and clumsily made due to less than spectacular graphics and game design, and overall Super Mario 64 is just a really lackluster and highly overrated game.  If not for influence, this game would have been forgotten and the superior Super Mario Galaxy series would have prevailed even more dominantly than they already do.  Oh and don't even mention the cake-eating storyline.  It's atrocious.  The fact they brought it back for the Galaxy series makes me want to vomit.
Please put down your pitchforks, my friends, and give me a chance to explain. I am no Nintendo hater. Quite the contrary in fact, and when it comes to the Paper Mario series, I have always been a massive fan, whether it's theoriginal, classic Paper Mario,its utterly amazing sequel, The Thousand-Year Door, or the more platformer-centricSuper Paper Mario, I love me some Paper Mario games. I can't tell you how excited I was when Sticker Star was announced. I bought my 3DS way back when highly anticipating this game, and even though it went through several delays, I waited patiently. All through development, this was promised to be an entry that would take Paper Mario back to its RPG roots, in every sense, and I couldn't have been more psyched. The first two or three hours in, I really enjoyed my time with Sticker Star. It was a blast and the undeniable Paper Mario charm was off the charts. Then, I started to notice some glaring issues, and they became more glaring with each passing moment until I realized something painful, I don't really like this game all that much. Please, put down your torches and pitchforks and let me explain (and I want to be fair to the game and to you, the readers, so this may be a long, detailed review, I'm warning you right now)...First off, there's a reason why I was hooked for the first two or three hours. There are a lot of positives in this game's favor. Here are the biggest ones:- The Presentation. The visuals are spectacular, possibly the best the series has ever had, in fact. The whole "children's pop-up book" aesthetic of the Paper Mario series has always been one of its biggest strengths. Not only is it cute, but it somehow pulls off being simultaneously nostalgic and fresh to the extreme, and it's done really well here. Many familiar locales from Mario's history, most notably from thethe New Super Mario Bros series, get their chance to shine, and shine they do. The nostalgia and familiarity is really endearing and some new twists on familiar oldies, like a Mariachi Shy Guy band, or a Yoshi sphinx, are fantastic. There's also something awesome about 2-D, flat paper characters and settings rendered in true 3-D on the 3DS. It's like playing a child's school project diorama come to life. Great job here! And then there's the soundtrack. Oh the soundtrack! The music in this game really blew me away, and on occasion merits putting down the system just to soak it in for a while. Much of it feels like they told a Jazz band to just go nuts with familiar Mario motifs and themes, and it's awesome. Plenty of sax and trumpet to go around. Sweet stuff. Don't even get me started on how sweet the Mariachi Shy Guy band music is.- Stickers, stickers, stickers. Everything revolves around stickers. Yes, everything. The battle system is entirely sticker based, and oftentimes you need certain stickers to solve puzzles in the various levels you visit. Maybe you need to put a mere normal sticker in the environment to open a door. Or maybe you need a special "thing" sticker that comes to life and affects the environment in big and surprising ways. There's lots of clever puzzles throughout the whole game. I found the whole "sticker" theme to be a refreshing twist on the classical Paper Mario formula, or at least I found the concept to be great anyway.- The Battle System (more on this in the bad section later). In an attempt to return to Paper Mario's RPG roots, Intelligent systems made the battle system a turn-based affair once again. To fight a sense of "been here, done that," they decided to make the battle system revolve around stickers. This means two things. 1.) The entire battle system is, for all intents and purposes, entirely item based (or sticker inventory based, if you will), and 2.) There's a system of strategy that involves proper button inputs to increase the effectiveness of whichever sticker command you choose. This gives the battles a great sense of risk vs. reward as you wonder, "Can I use this less powerful 'worn-out hammer' perfectly and finish the battle that way? Or should I pull out my more powerful 'flashy hammer' sticker and guarantee a victory?" This is really cool.This all sounds awesome, doesn't it? Well, yes, that's because it is. It's a unique twist that at least starts to bring the series back to its RPG roots. There are a few HUGE problems, however, that really pull the rest of the game down. I'll try to explain them now:- The story. There is no story, really. Yeah, at the beginning, Bowser grabs a giant, mythical royal sticker he's not supposed to, and because of that sticker's power, he himself becomes a super powerful, shiny sticker. He gives each fragment of the original royal sticker to five of his henchmen across the land, and it's up to Mario to go to each area, traverse their levels, and get each crown sticker back. After this introduction to the story, there's nothing more. No more plot, no more interesting characters, no real developments. It's bizarre, because the game actually feels like a traditional Mario platformer in terms of its story, in that, there is virtually none. Even the way you get from level to level is like a Mario platformer: an overworld map in a "level 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, etc." sort of way. Again, it's more akin toNew Super Mario Bros. Each level itself is styled in the way the original Paper Mario was, but there's no big world to explore, no big, interesting towns to visit, no companions to meet and take along with you, nothing. There's only one companion, a floating crown sticker named Kersti who is basically Mario's very ownNavi, but not nearly as charming or likable. Even Super Paper Mario, which was basically a platformer at heart, had way more plot and characters than this. What happened? There's no incentive to keep going, as far as plot is concerned. Again, in a Mario platformer, that's not a problem, but this isn't a platformer! It's *supposed* to be more of an RPG, and in an RPG, plot is kinda important.- The Battle System. Now wait a minute, didn't I say this was a positive? Well, yeah, the battle system itself is fantastic, except for one MASSIVE problem: It's all meaningless! After playing for an hour or two, I noticed something; there's no place in the menu to see Mario's stats, or his level, or his equipment... there's only sticker inventory. Wait, does that mean there's NO experience points (or Star Points, to be accurate) or leveling up in this game? Yep, there are *zero* tangible benefits to battles. The ONLY reward for winning battles are coins and stickers. Stickers are *everywhere* in the world as you explore, so this battle reward is meaningless. Coins are also everywhere in the levels, and their only use is for buying more stickers, so again, meaningless. The battles that are otherwise brilliantly conceived are rendered a waste of your time by no meaningful, tangible rewards for your efforts. There's no sense of progression in Mario's character, whatsoever. It makes more sense to just avoid enemies on the map altogether (who always respawn when you go back to already conquered areas, by the way, and since backtracking is a big part of this game at times, this is troublesome and annoying). Coming from Thousand-Year Door, where I actually sought out battles as much as I could due to their one-two punch of awesome design and satisfaction from winning, this is a *massive* gaffe. I mean, it's unforgivable really. Imagine truly great RPGs, ones likeFinal Fantasy IV(or VI, VII, and IX, take your pick, they're all amazing),Chrono Trigger,Earthbound,Radiant Historia, Super Mario RPG, the Mario and Luigi rpg series, or the first two Paper Mario titles, and imagine them without experience points, new, better equipment to find/aquire, or a leveling system. Blasphemy! If this wasn't trying to be an RPG, it wouldn't be so bad, but everything else in the game hearkens back to the RPG Paper Mario titles. *Sigh*- Perhaps the WORST thing about the game is its lost potential. When Intelligent Systems started work on this game, they wanted to make it a true sequel to 1,000-Year Door. They had a big, epic plot planned out. There was going to be a charming overworld filled with exciting places to explore and characters to meet. There would be several unique, lovable companions to join you on your quest. The theater turn-based battles with audiences would come back. All throughout the process, however, Shigeru Miyamoto rejected all of these ideas until this game became the finished product. I love you Miyamoto-San, but what the H-E-doublehockeysticks were you thinking!? If Intelligent Systems' original vision for this game had been allowed to come to fruition, I have no doubt whatsoever that this would have been a 5-star masterpiece. Look at their track record for a moment: all Paper Mario games up until this one, the Fire Emblem series, the Advance Wars series, the WarioWare series, Pushmo, Crashmo, and the list goes on. These guys are masters of their craft, and this would have been another masterpiece to add to that list, if only Uncle Shiggy hadn't gotten in the way (I love the guy, he's a true inspiration to gamers everywhere, but this is a blemish on his otherwise astronomically great record). What would have been a masterpiece has been turned into a game that is merely "OK," and that is the most painful thing of all about this game: The lost potential.I am not an overly critical person. I think this is my second or third 2-star review in total. I'd much rather review games I love or at least really like, not ones I think are just "meh" or "OK." I *really* wanted to love this game, but given the massive loss of potential, and the real botching of some of the most crucial aspects of the game that would have justified the change in direction, I just can't. I really tried with this game, but in the end, I just couldn't shake the growing feeling of disappointment and boredom anymore. Super Paper Mario really changed up the traditional formula, sure, but it was still a wonderfully executed game that was great on its own. Sticker Star could have been a nice spin-off Paper Mario title like that one was if there was even a slightly better plot to break the monotony, a battle system that actually feels rewarding, and a sense of satisfaction and progress for Mario's character throughout the game, but it just isn't there. Maybe others will find more enjoyment in this game. The game has some real strength in its presentation and many of the core concepts are sound, but it just isn't for me. I'm sorry Intelligent Systems, I'm sorry fellow Paper Mario fans, and most painfully, I'm sorry Paper Mario, but I just don't like Paper Mario: Sticker Star. Thanks for reading my review and hearing me out. You can go ahead and get out your pitchforks now.
Wow, if you are a fan of previous Star Fox video games (not including the horrendous "Star Fox Adventures" that was one of the first releases for the Gamecube) I have bad news for you...The newest addition to the series, Star Fox: Assault, is a huge disappointment.  It is horrible.  SOOOOOOO bad.  I looked forward to this game so much, and now I play it, literally had to force myself just to continue and cling to the hope that it could get better. But it never did get better.  In fact, I think it is safe to say the game goes steadily downhill after you defeat the first boss.  Well, maybe not so steady, the "fun" of the game completely disappears the third or fourth time you have to wander around on foot and destroy some variation of "shield generator".  I am not going to get too much further into that in this format though.  I want to make a list of all the reasons this game is horrible.1) of the 10 levels I played through, there were only 3 where you spent the majority of the time in your plane.  The rest of the time you spent performing tedious tasks on foot or in the "Landmaster" on the horribly designed ground levels.  Each time you are on foot you start with one of the crappiest guns I have ever used in a video game.  It cannot kill anything in one shot, has a painfully slow rate of fire, and an even slower charge up time (the enemies that only take damage from charged shots fire at a much faster rate).  This could be solved by a handful of things.  A) if the controls allowed you to dodge, charge your gun and aim at the same time.  Most console shooters incorporate a 2-stick control system (like that in Halo or Timesplitters).  If you want 2-stick control in this game, you have to adjust to wacked out control in your plane.  By wacked out I mean it makes you control the plane with one stick and the camera with the other.  This is just stupid.  The one stick control leads to several control problems.  I'll get to that in a minute.  B) easily obtained weapon upgrades.  Not only are new guns (machine gun, grenades etc.) scarce, but once you find one, they have limited ammunition.  AND switching between them is a pain (using c-stick to change weapons!?!?).  It also annoyed me that you do not get to hold onto your guns from level to level.  The design of the foot levels is almost too bad to describe with words.  Everything is camoflauged.  It is very difficult to distinguish enemies, doors and important items from the surrounding area.  enemies aren't too bad in this case, because they show up on your radar.  But you are not given a map to any of these levels, so finding doors, and knowing where to go next is a huge pain in the ass.  AND as if the ground levels could get any worse, the developers some how managed to ruin the "Landmaster".  The "Landmaster" is a tank that was introduced in Star Fox 64.  It offered a nice change of pace in that game, requiring quick side to side movement and well planned hops to clear obstacles.  In this game not only is the "Landmaster" lethargic (it was very fast on the 64), but the hovering and rolling abilities are rarely needed (the dodging that required these moves in the 64 game is what made the landmaster fun).  There is really no need to have the Landmaster in this game.  This is the last thing I will say about the ground levels.  While you are running around on foot with your crappy gun, with the rest of the Star Fox team flying around above you, they STILL request back up from you.  They expect that you will be able to land multiple shots on multiple enemies at great distance while dealing with the phantom enemies that appear out of nowhere on the ground.  This requires you to go into "aim mode", you cannot move while you are aiming, lead one of the 3-5 enemies tailing your friend, and land at least several shots from your pistol on each one within approximately 60 seconds of the original distress signal.  After scrambling (and failing miserably) the first time this happened, I decided to let my team mates "die", because unlike in the other games, where you were punished for this and your team mates actually made a difference, your team mates never appear to do anything helpful in this game and return for the next mission no matter what.2)  The Controls are horrible.  I touched on this a little in the previous gripe.  But I still can't believe just how bad they are.  You cannot assign the buttons however you want to.  You have 3-schemes  to choose from.  One is good for the plane, but horrible for the foot/Landmaster portions of the game.  The second one is good for the foot and landmaster portions, but is terrible for the plane portions.  The third one is horrible for everything... I really don't know why they included it, it is needlessly complicated.  The challenge of a game should not be adjusting to the control scheme.  They could have saved all of this trouble and restricted the game play to the plane... I think everyone (myself and any respectable star fox fan) would have been just fine with that.3)  The story is poorly written.  The old star fox games did not have great stories, but they made up for this by ignoring the story element of the game.  This game tries to push the story as important, and implies relationships between various characters, which isn't a bad thing to do, it is just executed poorly in this game.  Most of the voice acting is second rate at best.  Falco turned is no longer a cocky rebel with a quick tongue, but a mellow "surfer dude" with an annoying attitude.  The girl fox never really proves that she serves a purpose other than weak attempts to seduce Fox.  Fox's voice switches between a Keanu Reeve's type effect where he sounds perpetually lost, and an over anxious "I have done this a million times before I can't die I am the hero" voice.  Which is annoying because in the SNES and 64 games he always came off as someone who is humble, but actively seeking revenge.  Oh, and Slippy is more homosexual than ever before.  All the new enemies suck too.  And I won't even get into the whole mess of a story where you team up with the "Star Wolf" team more often than you fight them...4)  Ok, so running around on foot sucks, driving the landmaster sucks, I would have thought they would at least salvage the Arwing portions of play.  I mean it shouldn't be too hard, there are only 3 levels that are exclusive to the Arwing.  Well... the flying sucks too.  It is slower.  You turn slower.  You can't do the useful "turn on one side" move to get through tight spots which makes the Arwings width a huge burden.  Whenever you "spin" to deflect enemy shots it makes this huge engine blast that prevents you from seeing anything happening ahead of you.  The "rail" portions of the level are plagued by the stage moving into your plane and enemies flying into the back of your ship (possibly the most frustrating part of the game).  The "free" portions are hurt by the speed of the Arwing (so sloooooooooow) and large, stationary ships cluttering up the battlefield (ally calls for help and they are on the other side of a huge ship, there is no way to get there in time, especially when your radar gives you no idea of how much distance is between the two of you).  You also start with no bombs, and do not retain the upgrades you find in the levels, as you did in the previous games.  This is very annoying in this game because the upgrades and pickups are very scarce, so you spend most of the plane levels with a crappy single laser (this sounds familiar...).  On top of all of this, the flying bosses seem recycled and old.  For example, the first boss is identical to Andross (main boss in the SNES and 64 versions).  While I'm on the topic of bosses, they are all very easy.  Not only easy to kill, but easy to figure out.  No thinking required here.5)  The radar is barely helpful.  In previous Star Fox games, radar was only used in "free" flight periods of the game.  When it was used though, it showed you EVERYTHING.  So you knew the direction and had an idea of the distance between yourself and friends and foes.  The area it displays now barely extends past your plane/landmaster/self.  So you have lots of colored dots lining the perimeter of your radar... this is not very helpful when an ally cries for help...6) This may sound stupid, but it annoyed me that Peppy is no longer one of the Star Fox pilots.  He has been replaced by the blue fox thing that you rescue in Star Fox Adventures.  He is still in the game, but hangs out in the Great Fox and *SPOILER* he dies.  Or at least he appeared to have killed himself at the point in the game that I stopped playing because it was killing me to see one of my favorite game franchises perverted like this.There are probably more things that I have missed.  This game is unbelievably bad.  I quit playing on what I am pretty sure is the last level because I was fed up with enemies flying into the back of my ship (in the "rail" portions of this game it is impossible to prevent this), and my best efforts being wasted by the stage shifting into my ship when I would turn at high speeds (it felt like the game was having to catch up to me).  I don't know why they (developers) keep tampering with this game.  Star Fox is not complicated.  Make enemies fly through in patterns, award points for shooting them down, have the stage collapse/change in front of you in time for you to get an idea of the pattern the gates will close, but quick enough so you will be forced to make choices (left or right, up or down, boost or break, flip on your side or stay flat).  It isn't hard... it isn't even that complicated.  Grounding me, Fox McCloud, leader of the Star Fox team, makes no sense at all.  The game is called STAR Fox.  Not RUN AROUND AND COLLECT STUFF Fox, or SHOOT BUGS WITH A SISSY PISTOL Fox, or LAND LOCKED DESTROYER OF FORCE FIELDS Fox.  It is STAR Fox.  STAR, like the things you find in outter space.  A game with such an obvious name should not be spent running around searching for alien spawn points.Despite the ridiculous controls, this game was still very easy, which just adds to the poor quality.  Bad story, horrible gameplay, really easy.  I will give one of the other control schemes another run tomorrow... But I doubt that will change anything.  This game sucks.  I am going to email Nintendo and complain, tell them how they are killing one of their best franchises... not really.  But it is true.  I should have known by the disgusting remixed theme song that played at the openning screen that this would be a disgusting remixed version of the first 3D game I ever played (going back to play the SNES Star Fox and remembering how its graphics were once revelutionary... wow, progress is funny).
Wow, if you are a fan of previous Star Fox video games (not including the horrendous "Star Fox Adventures" that was one of the first releases for the Gamecube) I have bad news for you...The newest addition to the series, Star Fox: Assault, is a huge disappointment.  It is horrible.  SOOOOOOO bad.  I looked forward to this game so much, and now I play it, literally had to force myself just to continue and cling to the hope that it could get better. But it never did get better.  In fact, I think it is safe to say the game goes steadily downhill after you defeat the first boss.  Well, maybe not so steady, the "fun" of the game completely disappears the third or fourth time you have to wander around on foot and destroy some variation of "shield generator".  I am not going to get too much further into that in this format though.  I want to make a list of all the reasons this game is horrible.1) of the 10 levels I played through, there were only 3 where you spent the majority of the time in your plane.  The rest of the time you spent performing tedious tasks on foot or in the "Landmaster" on the horribly designed ground levels.  Each time you are on foot you start with one of the crappiest guns I have ever used in a video game.  It cannot kill anything in one shot, has a painfully slow rate of fire, and an even slower charge up time (the enemies that only take damage from charged shots fire at a much faster rate).  This could be solved by a handful of things.  A) if the controls allowed you to dodge, charge your gun and aim at the same time.  Most console shooters incorporate a 2-stick control system (like that in Halo or Timesplitters).  If you want 2-stick control in this game, you have to adjust to wacked out control in your plane.  By wacked out I mean it makes you control the plane with one stick and the camera with the other.  This is just stupid.  The one stick control leads to several control problems.  I'll get to that in a minute.  B) easily obtained weapon upgrades.  Not only are new guns (machine gun, grenades etc.) scarce, but once you find one, they have limited ammunition.  AND switching between them is a pain (using c-stick to change weapons!?!?).  It also annoyed me that you do not get to hold onto your guns from level to level.  The design of the foot levels is almost too bad to describe with words.  Everything is camoflauged.  It is very difficult to distinguish enemies, doors and important items from the surrounding area.  enemies aren't too bad in this case, because they show up on your radar.  But you are not given a map to any of these levels, so finding doors, and knowing where to go next is a huge pain in the ass.  AND as if the ground levels could get any worse, the developers some how managed to ruin the "Landmaster".  The "Landmaster" is a tank that was introduced in Star Fox 64.  It offered a nice change of pace in that game, requiring quick side to side movement and well planned hops to clear obstacles.  In this game not only is the "Landmaster" lethargic (it was very fast on the 64), but the hovering and rolling abilities are rarely needed (the dodging that required these moves in the 64 game is what made the landmaster fun).  There is really no need to have the Landmaster in this game.  This is the last thing I will say about the ground levels.  While you are running around on foot with your crappy gun, with the rest of the Star Fox team flying around above you, they STILL request back up from you.  They expect that you will be able to land multiple shots on multiple enemies at great distance while dealing with the phantom enemies that appear out of nowhere on the ground.  This requires you to go into "aim mode", you cannot move while you are aiming, lead one of the 3-5 enemies tailing your friend, and land at least several shots from your pistol on each one within approximately 60 seconds of the original distress signal.  After scrambling (and failing miserably) the first time this happened, I decided to let my team mates "die", because unlike in the other games, where you were punished for this and your team mates actually made a difference, your team mates never appear to do anything helpful in this game and return for the next mission no matter what.2)  The Controls are horrible.  I touched on this a little in the previous gripe.  But I still can't believe just how bad they are.  You cannot assign the buttons however you want to.  You have 3-schemes  to choose from.  One is good for the plane, but horrible for the foot/Landmaster portions of the game.  The second one is good for the foot and landmaster portions, but is terrible for the plane portions.  The third one is horrible for everything... I really don't know why they included it, it is needlessly complicated.  The challenge of a game should not be adjusting to the control scheme.  They could have saved all of this trouble and restricted the game play to the plane... I think everyone (myself and any respectable star fox fan) would have been just fine with that.3)  The story is poorly written.  The old star fox games did not have great stories, but they made up for this by ignoring the story element of the game.  This game tries to push the story as important, and implies relationships between various characters, which isn't a bad thing to do, it is just executed poorly in this game.  Most of the voice acting is second rate at best.  Falco turned is no longer a cocky rebel with a quick tongue, but a mellow "surfer dude" with an annoying attitude.  The girl fox never really proves that she serves a purpose other than weak attempts to seduce Fox.  Fox's voice switches between a Keanu Reeve's type effect where he sounds perpetually lost, and an over anxious "I have done this a million times before I can't die I am the hero" voice.  Which is annoying because in the SNES and 64 games he always came off as someone who is humble, but actively seeking revenge.  Oh, and Slippy is more homosexual than ever before.  All the new enemies suck too.  And I won't even get into the whole mess of a story where you team up with the "Star Wolf" team more often than you fight them...4)  Ok, so running around on foot sucks, driving the landmaster sucks, I would have thought they would at least salvage the Arwing portions of play.  I mean it shouldn't be too hard, there are only 3 levels that are exclusive to the Arwing.  Well... the flying sucks too.  It is slower.  You turn slower.  You can't do the useful "turn on one side" move to get through tight spots which makes the Arwings width a huge burden.  Whenever you "spin" to deflect enemy shots it makes this huge engine blast that prevents you from seeing anything happening ahead of you.  The "rail" portions of the level are plagued by the stage moving into your plane and enemies flying into the back of your ship (possibly the most frustrating part of the game).  The "free" portions are hurt by the speed of the Arwing (so sloooooooooow) and large, stationary ships cluttering up the battlefield (ally calls for help and they are on the other side of a huge ship, there is no way to get there in time, especially when your radar gives you no idea of how much distance is between the two of you).

Lately, the word Nintendo has almost become synonymous with thinking outside of the box.  First they released Wii Sports to the glee of consumers, which played a major role in increasing the size of the casual market.  Next came Wii Fit, which also sold like hotcakes despite having a ninety dollar price tag.  These unique gameplay concepts appealed to people, because they could partake in non-strenuous physical activity in the comfort of their home.  Pick up and play games have become increasingly popular, and Wii Music has been designed in the same mold.  Unlike the previous two games however, Wii Music fails to deliver an experience that will captivate most consumers.  The marketing behind Wii Music will likely trick your average consumer, but the gameplay behind it will probably disappoint most people once they get their hands on it.  Swinging a racket in Wii Tennis was a lot of fun, because it felt similar to the real thing without being overly complex, but Wii Music's gameplay feels as if it were made for those not yet ready to enter grade school, even though it is an experience made for everyone.Admittedly, the concept behind Wii Music is a good one--the game claims to have 60 playable instruments, but in reality, that isn't entirely true.  While there are 60 instruments, there are only four control methods, so you are basically playing the same four instruments the entire game.  Sure, they sound slightly different--close to their real life counterparts with a diminished sound quality, but using them feels the same.  One of these control methods has you holding the instrument like a recorder--you hold the instrument close to your face and alternate pressing the 1 and 2 buttons.  You'll do this for most wind and brass instruments included in the game.  The next control method has you playingguitar-like instruments by holding the Wii-nunchuk steady in your left hand, while moving the Wii-mote up and down as if you were strumming a guitar.  Unlike the recorder-like control, this doesn't feel much like the real thing.  The third control method has you playing instruments such as the piano and drums by moving your left and right hands up and down as if you were hitting a drum.  Many of the instruments use this control method, so eventually this gets tiresome.  I often felt like I was a baby throwing a tantrum.  Actually, if I was a baby, I probably would throw one because of the boring, repetitive gameplay.  Finally, the fourth control method has you holding your left hand steady while moving your right hand horizontally and simultaneously pressing the B button.  This movement is meant to simulate moving a bow across the string as you would with a violin or cello.  These four methods are decent during your first thirty minutes playing Wii Music, but they quickly grow old, and don't give you the feeling that you're playing real instruments.Not only are the control methods flawed and unoriginal, but the core gameplay is lacking as well.  Unlike Guitar Hero and Rockband, there aren't scores or ways of capturing how well you play.  In jam sessions, where you can play with up to four people, there are note charts you can look at, which tell you the optimal places to play the notes, but you are also encouraged to use improvisation to give the pieces you play a unique flair.  This is a cool feature, but your pieces will never sound as good as you hope, due to the low quality sound in Wii Music.  It would be nice if the pieces featured CD quality sound, but I suppose that won't be a huge issue to kids just looking to have fun.  Still, the game definitely feels lacking since it doesn't really have a system in place to help you perform the pieces the way they were meant to sound.  Like other reviews have said, Wii Music is really more of a toy than a game.  There aren't many objectives to complete, and the gameplay is extremely simplistic for the most part.Wii Music does have its merits however.  While the song list doesn't feature pieces that are popular today, it features many well known American classics, as well as world music.  I heard many of these songs as a kid, and it was cool to experience them again despite the poor quality audio.  Wii Music contains very little video game music: the Mario theme, Zelda theme, Mute City from F-Zero, and a couple Animal Crossing songs.  Well, it also includes the Wii Sports and Wii Music themes, but to me they just sound like elevator music.  It would have been great if more Nintendo songs were included, but the song list is still a good selection for general audiences for the most part.  Wii Music has many famous songs such as Ode to Joy, Minuet in G Minor, Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star, Yankee Doodle, and The Loco-Motion.  There are also international songs like Frere Jacques and Sakura.  The fifty included songs will keep you busy for awhile, but it is a chore unlocking them.  You have to go through many tedious "training" modes as well as watch many saved videos of your performances in jam sessions.  Even when you unlock all the songs, the repetitive nature of the game will quickly set in due to the lack of gameplay goals.Besides single and multiplayer jam sessions, Wii Music includes a variety of other modes.  If you have a Wii Balance Board, you have the option of engaging in a special drum-training session that utilizes the board.  It is fun to mess around with in  a regular jam session, but the training mode is far too difficult due to the unintuitive nature of the control set-up.  A full drum set includes many parts, so it is understandable that this mode isn't easy, but Nintendo could have made it a little more intuitive.  It is difficult to manage using your feet on the board and waving both arms in a variety of ways, while holding or depressing buttons at the same time.  Some of the motions do drastically different things depending on what button you're holding down, so it all just becomes too much to keep track of.  If you have a board, just mess around with it in jam sessions.  The other modes are less complex and are generally more enjoyable.Handbell Harmony is an entertaining mode that has you using your rhythm skills.  In this mode, your Mii holds two different colored bells at the top of the screen.  On the main section of the screen, you'll find colored bells scrolling by, and when your colored bells enter a bell shape contained in a bar on the center of the screen, you swing your arm that is holding that color.  In this mode, you are graded on how well you do, so it is fun challenging yourself to see if you can get the correct timing when the mode is set at high tempo.Pitch Perfect is another fun mode, but it is more in lines with music education than actual playing.  For those who have perfect pitch or have played an instrument in the past, you'll probably find this mode fairly easy.  I managed to breeze through all the lessons but one without losing, and that one loss was due to a minor mistake.  This mode could be useful to those who are new to music, but it may also be frustrating to those who lack patience.The other two modes are fairly disappointing.  One of them, Mii Maestro, has you conducting a symphony.  To conduct, you simply lift your arm then bring it down at whatever speed you wish.  This allows you to control the tempo and volume of the orchestra.  It doesn't feel very accurate however.  I used to be in a symphony, so I have witnessed a conductor on multiple occasions, and conducting is much more complex than a simple up-and-down hand motion.  It didn't feel very accurate, and even though I knew some of the pieces and have good rhythm, I still couldn't figure out how to get a high score for some of the songs.The final mode is a set of lessons for various styles of music.  There are lessons for rock, jazz, reggae, classical, and Japanese music.  Each of these lessons teaches you little tricks for using certain instruments, but the techniques given are difficult to remember, and you'll quickly become bored after playing Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star over sixty times.  It was nice to be able to hear each instrument and learn what instruments go well together, but the way in which the techniques are taught will make you wonder why you are wasting time with this game.Lastly, I will briefly mention Wii Music's presentation.  The presentation is similar to Wii Sports and Wii Fit--the interface is simplistic, and a minimalistic approach is used with the graphics.  This likely won't surprise anyone who has played other casual games for Wii.  I like how the interface is simple, but there are some design flaws.  For one, the musical maestro who teaches you everything is extremely annoying, and someone who observed me play this game commented that he sounded like he was speaking gibberish with Mario's voice.  He quickly becomes annoying, and at times there is far too much text.  One aspect of the presentation is impressive however--I like how you can send videos of your performances to friends online.  While sharing videos is a cool feature, it doesn't do much for Wii Music since it is such a boring game.  It is unlikely that your friends will want to yawn at your videos when they are already bored to tears by their own.I am extremely disappointed with Nintendo's latest casual game for Wii.  As a long time supporter of the company and Shigeru Miyamoto, I was surprised at how mundane this title turned out to be.  I was definitely expecting more in the gameplay department.  There are many other casual games that are more fulfilling than Wii Music.  Nintendo has gotten lazy recently, and to keep them in check, I recommend that consumers avoid this title and make better use of their money by purchasing one of the great original games that have been released this year.  I mean come on, would you rather spend fifteen dollars for a masterpiece such as World of Goo, or spend fifty dollars on a noisemaker?
Yes, because Metroid is one of Nintendo's most long-running and successful gaming franchises, Metroid Prime 3 had no choice but to be created and released. But you know, it's certainly nowhere *near* a classic because it's basically a watered down, less interesting sequel but with slightly improved graphics and sweet-looking explosions.  Actually, the explosions aren't necessarily better than the first two Prime games, but I found myself admiring them more this time around (perhaps because I was bored out of my mind in so many other ways).Remember the original Metroid on the NES, Metroid 2: Return of Samus on the Game Boy, and Super Metroid on the Super NES? These games were released a long time ago, and what made them so fantastic was how the gameplay emphasis on each of them was on "exploration".In Metroid Prime 3, you predictably go through one hallway after another shooting whatever you see. While it's somewhat fun, the lack of exploring hurts the game a LOT and prevents it from having much in the way of replay value. I also hate how it takes such a long time to defeat some of the bosses in the game. It was never like that in the past (playing the 2D Metroid games, I mean).  Are you kidding me?  20-30 minutes to completely eliminate ONE boss battle?  Why in the heck does it take so darn long???  This complaint holds true with the previous two Prime games as well.  That's a major, unforgiveable problem.Also, and this is a pretty big complaint, the regular enemies you encounter while going through these numerous, one-way hallways are usually small, horribly animated, and just boring to watch/fight.  NOTHING compared to the enemies in the first two Prime games.  We're talking dreadfully boring enemies to the point you sometimes find yourself just preferring to run past them and not waste a single moment fighting them.  I'm extremely disappointed here.  It makes me think the third installment in the series is an obvious milk job by Nintendo.Besides the first hour of the gameplay being extremely tedious and boring because you're doing nothing but talking to soldiers like it's a borderline RPG game, exploring generic computer rooms that we've seen to death in thousands of other video games, and admiring constant blue/grayish colors throughout *every* single wall located on *every* single hallway (yes that's sarcasm) the game eventually changes so you're exploring different areas of land by way of your spaceship.  Too bad each of these lands ends up missing the mark and looking rather dull compared to the previous Metroid Prime games.  Actually it's more like a poor imitation of previous efforts.That's not quite the biggest issue I have with the exploration feature however.  The BIGGEST problem is that the game is nothing more than a lengthy series of miniature and narrow hallways constantly taking you to even MORE miniature and narrow hallways.  You're probably wondering why I keep saying "narrow" and it's because, for the most part, the hallways are exceptionally tiny and uninteresting.  It's like so much effort was put into the background graphics (which are overrated by the way- the game doesn't look *that* great) that the development team thought they could get away with slacking off on the level design.  I don't think so- if a game's not fun to play, it's not worth my time.  Basically no matter where your ship goes small hallways will definitely be in store for you.  The areas that are actually fairly beautiful are usually either too short so you never feel obligated to stop and take notice, or appear like an obvious rehash of the places you were already fascinated by in Prime 1 and 2.Ice missiles are a really bad idea.  Yes, you can freeze the lava and make a walkable platform for yourself.  Who cares?  These aren't the kind of improvements that take advantage of the Wii's capabilities.  It's not the kind of improvements to shell out money for either.  Grappling doors and enemies isn't very fun either.  In fact, you might even say it's downright cheap.  While grappling an enemy, most likely another enemy from off-screen will shoot laser balls at Samus and drain a good deal of your health.  Meanwhile you can't do a darn thing about it because you're stuck in the grappling position with the first enemy.  Oh sure, this entire process only takes a few seconds (by either letting go of the grapple or going through with it and removing the enemies shields) but SEVERAL of the space creatures in the game are frantic laser ball-shooting maniacs, so it only take a few seconds to empty good chunks of your life energy.  This means you need total preparation to deal with these tough enemy situations but unfortunately the unfair and relentless nature of their ways makes it a needlessly tough task.Lock onto enemies, fire repeatedly until they die, rinse and repeat.  It's predictable and boring now.  This is exactly what you'll be doing the entire way through.  You'll most likely be doing it while being forced to deal with unavoidable laser ball blasts by the space creatures.  I prefer the 2D games where you actually had to aim and practice your skills to eliminate the bad guys.  With enough practice you'd actually be able to *master* the games.  This is probably not entirely THIS games fault- but 3D games in general.  Ugh, enough is enough.Speaking of the Wii, who's bright idea was it to make the game so you actually have to turn and pull on the Wii remote to do certain commands involving opening doors and whatnot?  Yes, I'm referring to grappling again.  No, you don't have to do these commands for EVERY door you walk through- just specific ones.  It's still a terrible idea and it's more annoying than anything else.Speaking of doors, why in the WORLD does it take 10-15 seconds to load a door?  Are you kidding me?  This game was released in 2007 (not 1996) so it's absolutely pathetic that we have to sit there and wait for the doors to open, especially when this wasn't even a problem in the first two Prime games.  Ridiculous.  Also -while waiting for a door to open up- make sure you've taken care of all the enemies in the room (and I mean ALL of them).  They WILL find a way to sneak back into the picture and blast Samus from behind.  Such a dreadful gameplay flaw.Another enormous gameplay problem are the puzzles that require the gamer to deal with infinitely spawning enemies while trying to accomplish a task.  Many times, after spending more than 20 minutes trying to finish a task and being unable to do so thanks to the enemies being a frequent problem with their recurring ways,  I just shut the game off and say "I'm done with this BS".  I strongly dislike the way the puzzles are designed in this game.  I can't tell you how many times I was *almost* finished and an enemy became a distraction and I either couldn't finish the puzzle or died.  Frustration to the highest extent.The one positive is that Hypermode is pretty awesome.  No, it doesn't actually speed up the gameplay (like I originally thought when I first read about it).  Instead, Hypermode is the name of a really powerful laser beam-type weapon that blasts the living heck out of anything that moves.  It's pretty awesome.  However, there's a certain degree of complexity involved in using it properly that's a bit overbearing and therefore annoying.  It's only a slight learning curve admittedly because once you figure it out you'll be fine after that, so I can't complain about it TOO much. I can however, complain about something else- that being, when you immediately enter a room and become overwhelmed by enemies and therefore become corrupted right away, and you have ZERO time to react and therefore you die immediately.  Cheap, uncalled for, and severely flawed.The first three Metroid games ever made for the NES, Game Boy and Super NES were REALLY different from each other and that's another thing that made each of them appealing to gamers everywhere.  Alright, so the first two Metroid games aren't THAT much different (besides the obvious color and graphic differences) but certainly Super Metroid is a drastic step in a significantly different direction.The first three Metroid Prime games however, are all basically the same. It's *really* not like Nintendo to ever milk a series (with the exception of Mario perhaps) but for some reason, they're letting it happen with the Metroid Prime series. It's probably time they stopped working on making Metroid games and focused on another creation, because innovative gaming in the Metroid series is probably now a thing of the past.

To see how ripped off Nintendo is, let's do a simple conversion math.The goal is to find a 1019 Blocks card has how many Mega Byte or Kilo Byte?Let us do some calculation8 Bit = 1 Byte1 Mega Bit or Byte = 1024 Kilo Bit or ByteMemory Card 1019 Blocks = 64 Mbit = 65536Kbit = 8192 KByte = 8 MByte8192 KByte / 1019 blocks = 8.0393 KByte/blockHow much is nintendo charging? $28.95How large is Playstation 2 card?8 Mega Byte = 64 Mbit = 59 blocks *64/4 = 944 BlocksHow much are we paying for 512 MByte SD, Compact Flash, or Memory Stick?Around $8.00 or even Free.And who wants 512MB cards these days?Not a lot of people, almost no one. Most people today are going for 1 to 2 GB or 4GB for flash memory for PSP, MP3, Videos, and Pictures.Lets use the $8.00 = 512MB = 60416 Blocks as of today's standard. That means 1019 blocks should cost:1019/60416 * $8.00 = $0.135Wow so Nintendo is actually over priced by 641.12% by charging at $1.00.So in conclusion:Nintendo is 18,272% over charged consumers for only 8 MB memory card, which no body even use today for any mp3 players nor USB massive storage device with even many times faster speed than this Gamecube card!!!!!The saddiest part is for those people who has Wii and want to play Gamecube games, they are forced me use the Gamecube memory cards.  You cannot save Gamecube data on Wii Internal memory nor SD cards!!!!Nintendo is creating a hazzles to consumers!! the graphics suck, boring game

I've already reviewed "Super Mario Bros. 3" elsewhere, with both the 8-Bit NES version and the "Super Mario All-Stars" version.  I don't want to spend a lot of time and space on "Super Mario Bros. 3" specifically, but instead focus on this port (which is based on the "Super Mario Allstars" version).  We all know "Super Mario Bros. 3" is a classic title.  So, let's dispense with the cursory introduction of "Super Mario Bros. 3".  Basically, this is just a copy and paste job from a short blurb I wrote in my 2004 review of "Super Mario All-stars"."SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 3: The best selling game ever released independently, SMB3 greatly expanded the Mario universe with the introduction of several new enemies, Bowser's children (who was the mother, I wonder? Godzilla's ex?), and introduced cool new suites for Mario to wear. The game play was more expansive than ever, with cool new secrets to discover and eight tremendously large worlds. This game laid the foundation for so many other plat-formers, especially SUPER MARIO WORLD. While SMB2 felt like a weird detour, SMB3 took Mario back to the atmosphere or the original game, taking it a thousand different directions, and coming up with one of the best games ever developed. Although there were a few tweaks for the ALL STARS release (some levels got a few more coins to make it easy to access game secrets), like the other games this is tremendously faithful to the original NES release. That alone makes this essential playing"To further elaborate, there are a few cosmetic changes, but this is largely the All-stars port of "Super Mario Bros. 3" that we all know and adore.  Ok, we all love SMB3?  It's an eternal classic, etc, etc. Best game on the NES. Yada yada.  Everyone on the same page?  Good.Now, let's get to the problems of "Super Mario Advance 4", and yes, there are problems.  Well, one problem anyway.  And it's a BIG problem.  It's a little selling point called e-Reader compatibility.  What's so great about e-Reader cards you ask?  Well, I'm glad you asked.e-Reader cards features new content than can be added to pre-existing games.  In the case of "Super Mario Bros. 3", there were three specific types: Power-ups (which uploads specific items into Mario or Luigi's inventory list and can be used an unlimited amount of times), Demo Cards (which showed Mario speed-running, collecting enough coins to unlock a blue Toad House, or doing infinite 1-Up tricks - essentially, the hint videos of "New Super Mario Bros. Wii" six years before), and, wait for it . . . New Levels.Yes, you read right.  New levels.  Yes, Nintendo made NEW LEVELS to "Super Mario Bros. 3", and a whole new world called, appropriately enough, "World-e".  Note, these are not the 15 inaccesible levels embedded in the original NES "Super Mario Bros. 3" code. Nintendo released ten levels in Japan, the PAL reigion, and America, with two different series.  Fantastic, eh?  Awesome?No, not really.  In fact, as a Mario can you just feel cheated.  Why?  Well, for one, although Japan frequently gets exclusive content, Nintendo released a full TWENTY TWO additional new levels in Japan only, because (again, wait for it) . . . Nintendo discontinued the e-Card readerSo, what's frustrating here?  Mainly, Nintendo made THIRTY THREE NEW LEVELS (which, to put in perspective, is over a third of the original game, as "Super Mario Bros. 3" has 88 levels total), plus five re-made levels in "Super Mario Bros. 3" style of "Super Mario Bros.".  These were levels 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, and 2-1.  Also, in homage to "Super Mario World" there are five new coloured switches which effect gameplay in different ways, but again only were released in Japan.Although many think Boomerang Mario first appeared in "Super Mario 3D Land", actually he first appeared in these one-off levels on the e-Cards, but (with only one exception, "Slidin' the Slopes", where you can use a boomerang on that one level only, just like Goomba's Shoe on 5-3) no one outside of Japan got to play as Boomerang Mario.  2/3s of the e-cards appeared only in Japan.Another problem with the e-Cards?  In World-e, there are three mushroom houses, each featuring three specific mini-games.  To unlock these mushroom houses, you must get Advance Coins found in the new levels (a precursor to the Star Coins of the "New Super Mario Bros." series).  But here's the kicker.  Outside of Japan, there's only enough coins to access ONE of these three mini-games, because there's not enough currency in the ten levels that Nintendo actually did release to unlock the other two.In Europe, the gamers got screwed even worst than the Americans, with the e-Card functionality completely disabled, inaccessible through normal gameplay.For Mario fans, this is beyond disappointing.  Nintendo put so much effort into new content, and yet do to poor implementation the majority of gamers will not get to experience these fantastic levels.  The e-reader was also a failure, so the cards weren't available for very long anyway.  Had all this new content been released in the game proper, "Super Mario Advance 4" would be the definitive port of "Super Mario Bros. 3"; as it stands, there is only a vague sense of disappointment and incompletion for those who know about the new content.These are the true Lost Levels in the Mario universe, still commercially unreleased and widely difficult to play legitimately.  Note that the original "Super Mario Bros." had 32 levels.  These lost levels are 32 in number, along with three bonus levels and five remade levels.In the NES days that would be a full-length Mario title!

Nintendo put so much effort into new content, and yet do to poor implementation the majority of gamers will not get to experience these fantastic levels.  The e-reader was also a failure, so the cards weren't available for very long anyway.  Had all this new content been released in the game proper, "Super Mario Advance 4" would be the definitive port of "Super Mario Bros. 3"; as it stands, there is only a vague sense of disappointment and incompletion for those who know about the new content.These are the true Lost Levels in the Mario universe, still commercially unreleased and widely difficult to play legitimately.  Note that the original "Super Mario Bros." had 32 levels.  These lost levels are 32 in number, along with three bonus levels and five remade levels.In the NES days that would be a full-length Mario title!

Nintendo has shafted me again, first with a n64 that had no third party support. Now the same thing has happened with my Gamecube. I own all three new systems plus 5 older systems and I work for software etc. I know my business and our sales speak volumes. XBOX sales have picked up while Gamecube sales have dropped. well there is always the next system. For Gamecube I had to buy memory cards, a keyboard, an ethernet adapter, Then I bought an XBOX. Unlimited memory, and the only thing you might have to purchase is a dvd playback kit(which is cheaper than a Gamecube memory card). I own a real dvd player and im not stupid enough to use my console as a primary dvd player. Gamecube doesnt even have this option. This is 2003, 99% of the world doesnt have to use their game console as a dvd player. I found that most of the games on Gamecube are on XBOX except on XBOX they contain extras, far better graphics, sound and some even add online play. While online you can chat in every game, no need for a keyboard. Gamecube only offers 1 game with online play(shame on them).XBOX has over 235 games available and over 250 for this year alone, so games is not an issue. Finally someone has built a better system then ps2 and Gamecube. ps2 is good, gamecube is better, but the loading times, muddy jaggy graphics, no dolby digital,and now its losing all its exclusives to xbox. ps2 &amp; gamecube exclusives are getting fewer and the ones they have are seeking ways to get their games on other systems. GTAVC for example, rockstar is planning on releasing a side story to gta only for XBOX, so you can expect great graphics and much better gameplay on xbox. With games like Halo 2, Tao feng, Project Gothom 2, Dino Crisis 3, UFC Tapout 2, Dead or Alice Chronos, Brute force, Rallisport 2, Mech Assault,Unreal Championship, Panzer Draggon Orta, and many more exclusives, the proof is there if you look, developers are putting their best games on XBOX and then dumping the left overs on ps2 and gamecube. The XBOX exclusive games put anything the ps2 or gamecube has done to shame. Halo was released over a year ago and there still has been nothing from ps2 or gamecube that even comes close to the graphics, sound, story and even the online play rocks even though its not offical through xbox live, you have to play through gamespy. The new 800 pound gorilla is here, and its name is xbox.

After the N64's ultimate failure against the PSX many Nintendo fans (myself included) figured Nintendo would realize its errors and get back on the ball for this new wave of consoles. When the Gamecube was first announced it seemed that it would be a fierce competitor to the Xbox and the PS2. It had a nice variety of exclusive titles and sported a lower price than both other systems. Sadly over time, the majority of the exclusive titles went multiplatform.The Gamecube uses minidiscs instead of standard CD sized discs. This has its pros and cons. It gives GC games a faster loading time than the PS2 and Xbox but it prevents CDs and DVDs from being loaded into the tray. Minidiscs only hold 1.5gb of data while a standard DVD holds 4.9gb. This makes multiplatform games harder to put on the Cube since most games are around 3.5gb and the smaller size forces developers to cut out certain parts of a game in order to put it on the Cube. Now you know why you're seeing so many games that come out on both PS2 and Xbox but not the Cube. The choice to go with minidiscs ended up biting Nintendo in the butt just like their wild decision to use cartriges for the N64.As for the control design, the Cube's controller is pretty good. It looks awkward but is actually more comfortable than the Xbox controller. However, when it comes to controllers Sony has dominated that territory with its more simple, yet effective design.As for online gaming there isn't anything available other than Phantasy Star Online. A couple of years ago Nintendo stated that gamers didn't care about playing games online. They have since retracted that statement and ironically the Nintendo Revolution is expected to have online capabilities.As far as graphics go, the Gamecube has the edge over the PS2. The Gamecube is capable of Dreamcast quality rendering which the PS2 doesn't have and has 640x480 resolution like the Xbox and Dreamcast.The games department is where the Gamecube fails miserably. The Gamecube has a smaller library than the Xbox (even though they were launched around the same date) and the PS2's library trumps both systems. If you like lots of great fighting games, sports games, action games, or RPGs then look elsewhere. One can argue that there are some but for the past couple of years a lot of multiplatform games have just been passing over the Cube. Nintendo develops a fair amount of games itself for the system but the majority of the games are the same franchises that were around for the original NES in the 80s. Nintendo continually focuses on making Mario/Pokemon and other kiddie games for the Cube and continually ignores the tastes of adult gamers over the age of 18. Developers like Capcom, Sega, Square, and Namco have realized that the system sells poorly outside of Japan and are more reluctant to release exclusive titles for the Cube. As a result, many former Gamecube exclusives have jumped over to the Xbox and PS2. Over the past year the number of games being released on the Cube has dropped significantly. I hate to say it but it seems as if the system is already dying out and Nintendo's next-gen console isn't even close to being released yet.While it has better graphical capability than the PS2 and is more affordable than both other systems, the Gamecube has been crippled by its poor game library. I came up on the NES and SNES but with 2 failed systems in a row, I have to say that I will not purchase another Nintedo console. What really disappoints me is the fact that Nintendo just turned its back on the gamers who came up in the 80s and 90s (who made the NES/SNES sucessful) and continues to cater to the younger crowd.
