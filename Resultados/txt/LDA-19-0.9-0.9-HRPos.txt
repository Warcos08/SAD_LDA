I'm a recent convert from Turbo Tax like so many others. I have only installed this software, I have not used it yet so this review will regard the install only. Install should have been insert the disk and auto run should have taken over. It didn't. (I was installing the software on an OS Vista desktop.) The first three or so times I inserted the disk I got an error message...don't recall now what it said but it failed to install each time. No auto run or it didn't work. At one point, Windows offered to find a solution and then installed or used some type of Compatability Mode. ?  I restarted the computer and put the disk in the drive again. Nothing. I then went to Start Menu, Computer and right clicked the disk in the drive. The menu that appeared as a result of my right click said either run or install H&R Block software. I clicked on it and it installed. The install should not have been this challenging. Once I use the software to prepare my taxes I'll update this review.
The product works good once you get past the installation challenge.  In attempting to install this on Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit, the product would start to install, then crash.  After several tries and reboots, I figured maybe it was having permission problems.  So, the fix for me was to right-click on the setup icon and select "Run as administrator".  The installation went smoothly afterwards.

If you are experiencing troubles with installation, try the "Run as administrator" first.  It might just work!

I took one star since I wasn't sure if this was a feature or lack of documentation. Either way, bad and could have been a show stopper for the technically challenged.
I just downloaded this app and it's working well enough, but I couldn't get the darn update to work. It would just stay at "Gathering Information." Googling around led to me to lots of 1-star reviews of the product and this same problem. The common string was that non-system hard drives were mounted.

In one case it was an external HDD. In another case it was a Network drive that was mounted.

I didn't have any separate drives mounted, but I did have a Windows partition from Bootcamp that was mounted. I right/control-clicked the drive, ejected it, and the update immediately switched from "Gathering information" to installing.

I hope this saves everybody some time!

I've given the product 4 stars because this is a problem that should be addressed in HR Block's documentation. Moreover, from the things I read online, the customer service individuals are not trained to fix this bug, resulting in huge wastes of time.
Update #2 (4.1.15) SUCCESS!!!!!
After contacting H & R Block via social media (Facebook) I got a response. I was not happy with what HRB was offering for a response from their tech support (time and effort) so I contacted my system security tech support (ESET). They were great!!
First solution: Completely uninstall ESET System Security 8 and attempt updates and registration. IT WORKED! I got no certificate or system clock errors and was able to download the state program with no problem. I re-installed ESET and the HRB software is working fine so far. I have not tried to efile yet....

After a second email to ESET to achieve a permanent solution, they sent a link to illustrate how to add a firewall exception to their software. This allows a .exe file/program to function through the firewall. This link is below:
http://kb.eset.com/zap/SOLN2843

My only question to them now is why would a firewall exception be needed if, before, I completely turned off the firewall temporarily and it still didn't work???
I still maintain that HRB needs to modify their software to work within a Kaspersky or ESET environment! But then, I am stubborn that way.
Good luck fellow tax filers...and when you get to the healthcare section of the software...well, prepare yourself.
I will change my review from 1 star to 4 stars because, quite frankly the program is not bad to use.

UPDATE:
STILL NOT WORKING!! 3.28.15
I tried everything from removing my CMOS battery to resetting BIOS, turning off all system security, uninstalling browsers and removing security certificates, changing network and proxy settings, updated software, uninstall...reinstall... etc, etc....
I cannot activate the software, which, in turn does not allow me to efile federal AND cannot download the state version, even though I paid extra for it.
Internet searching has revealed no solution other than upset users who are getting no response from H&R Block.

First Post:
This review is for the download version. I am having problems registering:
"SSL Error: bad server certificate or incorrect PC date. Please check the date set on your computer."
Upon clicking OK...:
"We are not able to process your registration at this time (error code 20). If the problem persists, please register later."
OK, that's fine, I can still use the program.
However, when e-filing federal, AND trying to file state, I get the same error.
After visiting H & R web site and web searching for a fix, I have determined it is a bug that exists in which Amazon needs to update a possible "fixed" version on their download server...if that is how it works.
I have tried all the "turn off firewall, turn off virus protection, make sure proxy server is not on.......etc, etc."
All of this should make no difference anyway to a well designed piece of software....
I'm a long time user of this product but I'm disappointed with this version.  Immediately on install from CD I got a warning of the Artemis! virus.  It completed install even though it complained about missing a temporary file in c:\config.msi folder.  It seems to work ok but it will not update the Federal forms at all.  Right when the update is about to complete (4 seconds remaining) it stops and reverses the installation of the update.  No errors, no reasons.  I called H&R Block help line and of course with no errors, no help.  Unfortunately, the software is no good if the forms can't be updated.  If it matters I'm using 64-bit version of Windows 7.  I uninstalled/reinstalled a couple of times and same problem.  I even downloaded the update file directly from the H&R Block website, again same problem.  My only option is to return it for a refund.  I have to give them 1 star.

01/29/2010  UPDATE
I finally figured a workaround for my problem. I use McAfee VirusScan Enterprise and I set the following options in their On-Access Scan Properties window:
1) uncheck Enable on-access scanning at system startup (on the General tab window)
2) I set the Heuristic network check for suspicious files Sensitivity Level to Diable (on the General tab window)
3) uncheck Enable scanning of scripts (on the ScriptScan tab window)
4) rebooted my pc
5) since I got H&R Blook At Home Premium to load in Windows XP, I ran the install program from the CD in Windows XP SP3 compatibility mode and also selected to Run as Administrator
6) H&R Block at Home Premium installed without problems and I was able to update the forms
7) I reset my VirusScan settings back to their defaults and rebooted

Note: You may want to check out the comment on the 1 star rating (dated 01/19/2010).  That commenter may have suggested an easier solution.  I missed that comment last time I was up here.

I have now updated my 1 start to a 4 star.
I read all the warnings about it not loading or working on a Mac and the ones saying it did work, I downloaded it anyway.  It loaded fine no issues at all.  The first thing that pops up is box telling you to load an update to the Federal program and that does NOT work.  It will fail with an Unexpected error every time.  Click ignore and start the program.  From inside the program go to the upgrade page and from here the update WILL INSTALL CORRECTLY.  It should work from the initial pop up, but it does not so I found a work around.  Also, it may take 20-30 minutes for the update to load so be patient and let it run.

Once it updated, it seems to work well. I am another ex TurboTax user and I see some minor differences, but nothing that is a problem...
I have use HR Block software for years, have been very satisfied with it,  and have never had a problem with it until now. When I try to activate the software, it crashes and I get the following error message: "SSL Error: Bad server certificate or incorrect PC date." The date on my PC is correct.
Can someone help with a solution? I am very upset.

UPDATE: I found a solution to the problem I was having last night. If your computer uses a proxy server to connect to the internet, disable it if you get the error message I mentioned above. I did just that, was able to activate the software and it works fine now.
I bought H&R Block in 2014 because of the infamous TurboTax switch that suddenly required previous Deluxe users to buy the next more expensive package to get the same forms. TurboTax clearly learned their lesson big time. This past year I was turned off by all the excessive marketing mailings and emails I got from H&R Block, especially in December 2015 and January 2016, so I went back and bought TurboTax for 2015 tax year even though it cost me like $8 more. However without even opening TurboTax I returned it when I discovered it would only work if my computer is upgraded to the very latest operating system, while H&R Block will still run on an earlier operating system thats four years old now. TurboTax requiring me to back up and change my operating system and reinstall all my software before I could begin my taxes trumped all other considerations. And it probably will again next year.

That said, Ive used TurboTax for years and there are quite a few downsides to H&R Block besides the excessive marketing I already metnioned.

This may be a minor issue to you, but H&R block formatting is sometimes bad in multiple ways. Both pdf and hard copies often print a row of text that gets split across the bottom of one page and top of the next page, so that either top or bottom  of every character is cropped off. Over and over theres an orphan row of text from the previous page printed out at the top of an otherwise blank sheet of paper. The H&R block font on the forms is smaller and harder to read than TurboTax. There is less variety of font size on the H&R Block forms, so major headings don't stand out clearly from minor headings, and in general simply doesnt look as professional or easy to follow as TurboTax. TurboTax prints global page numbers at the bottom when I print out a set of forms with the supporting documentation as in page x of xx, H&R Block does not. Both my filed version and my supporting docs version were printed out in my printer. If I hadnt saved pdfs, itd be awfully hard to figure out where one H&R Block printout ended and the next printout began. All minor annoyances, but they add up.

Make sure you load your state module before you begin preparing your federal taxes. H&R Block correctly handled the portion of vehicle registration that was fed deductible last year. However this year I got some kind of error message for loading the state module when I first checked for updates, and I went ahead and entered the federal first. That was a mistake. Then once I loaded the state module it brought up a worksheet for vehicle registration. However it would never go back and correctly calculate the portion of my vehicle registration that was fed deductible, it would only put in the full amount of registration page. The only reason I knew the federal vehicle registration (tax) amount was wrong was because I googled this and a TurboTax help page described the correct calculation, and I checked my 2014 H&R block tax returns and it was a lower amount that matched the calculation formula I found online.

H&R Block seemed kind of confused about whether Id already loaded the latest federal updates. This was the first thing I did when I first put in the CD, yet it came back and asked me to get federal updates later in the same evening.

Also the first thing it does is automatically ask me to check for and load state updates when I hadnt even loaded the state module in the first place yet, and then gave me an inexplicable error message. That reflects poorly on the H&R Block software if its that confused - and confusing to the user. So it automatically asks you first about updates, but theres nothing automatic at all about prompting you how to download the state part in the first place. It was not at all intuitive to figure this out. Ive already paid for the state module, so why do you require me to figure out on my own I need to click a button that says buy to download it to my computer?

Just fyi, a search for registration did not turn up the correct place to Go To in fed form because this is called a state/local vehicle tax (general terminology to cover all 50 states). It is not called vehicle registration anywhere in the forms, because thats only what some states call it. It took some guesswork to figure out the right place to enter this fee (tax) on the fed side. I realize all the states are different, but state and local vehicle tax is vague enough it sounds like it could be about sales tax on vehicles purchased across state lines or something.

TurboTax does not get off scot free, either. Last time I used it two years ago TurboTax botched the calculation of points for my home mortgage - it asked me for total points from refinancing (paid in a prior tax year) and no matter what I tried it then insisted on applying all of them to a single (2013) year instead of spreading them over the life of the mortgage (as is generally required). I cant remember what I had to do to fix it but it included calling TurboTax support and reporting a glitch in the software. Neither home mortgage refinancing points spread over the life of a mortgage or motor vehicle registration are exactly obscure esoteric tax conditions that only apply to a small handful of people. To H&R Blocks credit, what they messed up in 2015 tax year had to do with a complex state issue and might only be a cascading consequence of their lack of clear prompts for downloading state modules and giving error messages for their automatic updates prompt, where  the spreading mortgage points glitch in TurboTax for 2013 tax year was something thats applied the same way in all 50 states.

Bottom line: if I already have the latest OS on my computer ever year anyway Id probably tip toward TurboTax. But if TurboTax is going to insist the only way I can use their product is if I take all the costs and risks associated with updating my computer operating system ever other year (sometimes backups don't restore correctly to the new OS - its happened), plus the cost to upgrade a bunch of other infrequently used software programs too, Ill take the shortcomings of H&R Block any day.
I've used TaxCut since the mid-1990's, and although I'm not totally finished with my 2009 tax filing (the reason for a 4-star), I wanted to get at least one more review for Windows 7 64-bit users.

I just installed today onto a Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit system, no errors at all.  Using an administrator account, I clicked "Install" once my DVD-drive recognized the CD, and took all of the defaults through the installation.  By default, it installed into the "C:\Program Files (x86)\HRBlock2009" directory which I believe indicates it's run in a compatibility mode.

It all worked fine.  Once the program started, I clicked "Register Later" to postpone until all updates were added, then the program immediately fetched a rather large set of updates.  It shut itself down, installed the updates, and restarted, again all error-free.  Then I registered, imported my 2008 tax data and proceeded to run through an initial interview.

I've ran through a fair number of the screens, those typical for a Deluxe user, and I've found no problems.  Everything works fine, pop-ups, Whole Form views, search, additional worksheets, custom form edits, help windows -- I haven't found any compatibility issues, but again, I've yet to complete (and I haven't printed or ran eFile).  With only a couple of 64-bit reviews, I was a little nervous -- prepared to install on my Mac anyway, but it wasn't necessary.  So far a thumbs up...
This software works fine on my computer with Windows 7. However, I encountered a problem last night when I was trying to update the software. After the installation on the update, I restarted the program, it then freezed with a status bar saying "...check the notifications." I spent about an hour to figure out what was going on. I uninstalled the software and then installed it again to see if the problem was gone, but it did not. I finally figured out that it was due to my zonealarm which blocked the HR from accessing the internet.  This is strange, because the HR tax worked prior to the update. Also, when the updated software freezes up, no pop up from zonealarm is seen to ask me if HR tax is allowed to get access to the internet. I guess that the updating messed up on some settings.
If you got the same problem, I suggest you to disable the zonealarm first. You then open the updated tax software. After that, start zonealarm.

This is our third year using the H&R Block computer program.  (Previously titled TaxCut)  It loads easily, imports previous year's information, and makes the whole process simple and painless.  I wish we had started using these programs years ago.
Have used their software for the past 4 years and I love it, my sister who is an accountant in a bank started using it....love it and will continue using for years to come.
We've used this 2 years in a row and have been really happy with the ease of use. It was easy to transfer all our information in from previous softwares.
I've used H&R Block tax software for several years now and am really happy with the simplicity of use and its accuracy. I've used the "other" tax software prior to using H&R Block and never had the same positive results.
I have used the H & R Block tax software for years and am very satisfied with it. Imports information from the previous year saving time reentering information.
I've used H&R Block's tax software for about 8 years now, and have always been satisfied.  No problems and I've never been audited!  I plan on using again next year.
I've used H&R Block now for several years.  Really like it.  Price is better here on Amazon than from H&R direct AND Amazon keeps a backup of previous years programs, which can really come in handy - like when I had to do a correction from a previous year.
I've used H&R Block software for years. This year is no exception.
I am pleased with it's performance and ease of use.
I've used this software for years and have not been disappointed yet. Easy to use and carries forward your information year to year.
I haven't used this years version yet but I've been using this software for many years and I've always been well satisfied with it.  The fact that it's cheaper than TurboTax doesn't hurt either.  I don't see any reason to use anything else.

Excellent springs! These are designed to fit all W203 based Mercedes Benz vehicles, but not listed as fitting on a C32 AMG. Please note, these are the EXACT same spring as the H&R # 52732 which is designed to fit the C32 AMG model. H&R tech confirmed this. They apparently created a separate item number due to the fact that the C32 sits a bit lower from the factory as the other models do, this way they can claim the correct estimated drop in ride height.
Logical, Clear, Familiar, knows what life events (moving, having children, adoption, deaths in the household, etc. prompt questions that could lead you to even lower tax rates -- and potentially a larger return!
I've been using TaxCut for about 10 years, so I'm mostly used to its quirks.  It works well - but woe unto you if you have a problem/question.  In particular, the state-level Help is nearly useless - it's sometimes worse than useless.  For example, Virginia has two different ways to deal with long-term care premiums - a credit and a deduction.  The help system only knows about the credit, which I can't use - I had to dig through the raw forms to find the deduction information.  And calling the 800# is no better  - the customer service person assured me it would be corrected in the March update (which doesn't exist, according to the web site), and suggested I buy a new CD with all of the updated forms!

So while I'd buy it again, don't follow it blindly.

The 2014 version is very much improved over 2012 and 2013.  All the formatting and display issues were not only corrected but the user interface is much improved.  It's very easy to use and the instructions are clear.  It's also possible to download tax information, e.g. brokerage statements etc. directly from participating institutions.  This saves lots of time.
Fit beautifully on my S80. Dropped the vehicle with perfect wheel gap front to rear. Very nice ride quality, improved handling. Car takes corners much better. Recommend replacing struts at the same time with Bilstein HDs.
Same product as store, yet much lower price. Will buy this was again next tax season. saves saves saves saves
I have found each item purchased exceeded my expectations.
User-friendly and quite useful for most needs.  It is fairly comprehensive, but there are a couple of limitations. It failed to address one aspect of my tax filing, which had to do with the agreement between Virginia and Maryland that allows a resident of one state to file a return for only that state even if the employer is in the other state.  The software provided no guidance on how to get a refund of withheld taxes for the other state.  However, that was not a major problem and I would buy it again for next year.

I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both H&R Block and TurboTax to compare. I found that both programs satisfied my needs but H&R Block costs consistently less.  I have been buying the Deluxe version of H&R Block, before purchasing I check to see if my needs are covered by the feature set of Deluxe version. The main thing I check if the mutual funds sales and cost basis calculations are included (Schedule D) and the form for Foreign Tax Credit from mutual funds is present (Form 1116). H&R Block Deluxe version includes these forms but to get this functionality in TurboTax you need to buy the Premium version of the software.

 INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 I had no problems with my install. However last year I helped a friend resolve an install problem on a Windows 8 PC.  I am including what we did in case this helps someone else. Normally the automatic install runs a file called "tcauto.exe". This file in turn calls another program located under "installers" directory which actually does the work.  We were able to by-pass the error by executing the exe program in the installers directory directly "HRBlock_Deluxe+Efile+State_2014_CD.exe" (it is the only file in that directory).

 If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

 If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you dowload it. The key-code can be located two ways.
Option 1: After my download finished the install started automatically offering me a choice of two links "View Keys" and "Install".
Option 2: You can locate it in your Amazon account:
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

 Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs?
I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic "Installing Software on Another Computer"
I quote the FAQ answer below:
"There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.
Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer.
Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.
The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, "Can I install the software on a second computer?"
Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate.
You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation."

 WHAT IS INCLUDED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I purchased H&R Block Deluxe plus State. This version entitles me to 5 free federal e-files. It allows me to print and mail as many returns as I want without any extra fees, there is no limit on printing or mailing returns using the Post Office.

One state software is included in the package but the package does NOT include free e-file for the state return (see one exception below). If you want to e-file your state return you will need to pay a fee of $19.95 to e-file each state return. Alternatively, you can print all the forms and mail them using US post office without any additional fees. If you need to file taxes for an additional state, each additional state is $39.95 plus $19.95 e-file fee.

Note: NY state residents can e-file state returns for free.

 GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until mid January of 2015.

 Pet Peeve: H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version. That would have been useful.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations. Last year I had to do both and I found the guidance in Deluxe package was sufficient to complete the forms.

 Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on "learn more" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.

 H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

 DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC. You no longer need to enter this information on H&R web site. I prefer having this information locally on my PC for better security.  It suggests reasonable prices based on condition of the donated item and it is nice not to have to come with what is reasonable on my own.

 Pet Peeve: I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

 I usually purchase tax software as early as possible to help me with end year tax planning. However, if timing is not important to you be aware that the price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter "Amazon price history alert" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word camel in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached. During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $44.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.

 Update: State returns are now available.
Original comment: For folks trying to download State Forms. The state forms are not available as of 11/30/2014. You have an option of entering email where you will be notified as soon as the form for your state becomes available. Alternatively, you can go to H&R website, hover (do not click) "Download Software" on the top banner and select "State Editions". Currently it says "Please check back in mid January 2015".

When the state forms became available and I clicked to start the download the entire program disappears for about a minute (I thought it crashed), but then the download screen appeared and the program continued normally.

 At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

 Sometimes I want to return to some section of my return.  The best way to jump to any section directly without navigating through other pages is to use "take me to" button which is displayed at the top of every page, on the same line as H&R Block banner.

 Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?
Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.

 Problem alert 
There is a bug importing TT 2013 data when using XP.  There is a lengthy discussion on this topic in H&R support forum including a post from H&R Support that they are aware of the issue and working on it.
Amazon does not allow to post URL links in the text of the review, so I am posting a link to the discussion as a comment. Hopefully there will be an update when the problem is fixed.

 The final tax return can be saved in a .PDF format for future reference.

 Updated 2/25/15. You might have noticed that front page states that the next update is March 12, 2015. Someone asked me about this rather late update and I was able to find what portion of the return is effected by the update by searching the H&R support forum: This update is related to "The Health Insurance Coverage" with "The Marketplace Health Insurance" for participants that are 65 or older.

 What to do if my social security number was used by a thief?

During the last year there were many different data breaches and some people's social security numbers have been stolen.  It appears that some thieves filed returns using the stolen social security numbers.  If this happens the person who tries to file a return will get the following error:

IRS records show the spouse's Social Security number (SSN) on this return is the same as the primary taxpayer's SSN on another return already filed this year. Double-check your spouse's SSN. Fix any issues and e-file again. Otherwise, you'll have to file a paper return.

What to do if this happens?
1. Call HRB told them of the issue (1-800-472-5625)
2. Call IRS (1-800-829-1040) had them flag the SS#
IRS states that people need to mail completed return, a copy of police report or Form 14039 Identity Theft Affidavit http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f14039.pdf, copy of Drivers License or passport or SS card.

3. Call Equifax and have them put an alert on the SS# (They notify Experian and TransUnion as well)
4. Call Social Security Administration and notify them (1-800-772-1213)
5. File with FTC https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/Information#crnt&panel1-1
6. File a police report of a possible identity theft


I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. I keep coming back because it works well for the tax forms I need to do and it is less expensive than TurboTax. If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.

Ali Julia review
I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both H&R Block and TurboTax to compare. I found that both programs satisfied my needs but H&R Block costs consistently less. I have been buying the Deluxe version of H&R Block, before purchasing I check to see if my needs are covered by the feature set of Deluxe version. The main thing I check if the mutual funds sales and cost basis calculations are included (Schedule D) and the form for Foreign Tax Credit from mutual funds is present (Form 1116). H&R Block Deluxe version includes these forms but to get this functionality in TurboTax you need to buy the Premium version of the software.

 INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 I had no problems with my install. However last year I helped a friend resolve an install problem on a Windows 8 PC. I am including what we did in case this helps someone else. Normally the automatic install runs a file called "tcauto.exe". This file in turn calls another program located under "installers" directory which actually does the work. We were able to by-pass the error by executing the exe program in the installers directory directly "HRBlock_Deluxe+Efile+State_2014_CD.exe" (it is the only file in that directory).

 If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

 If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you dowload it. The key-code can be located two ways.
Option 1: After my download finished the install started automatically offering me a choice of two links "View Keys" and "Install".
Option 2: You can locate it in your Amazon account:
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

 Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs?
I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic "Installing Software on Another Computer"
I quote the FAQ answer below:
"There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.
Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer.
Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.
The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, "Can I install the software on a second computer?"
Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate.
You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation."

 WHAT IS INCLUDED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I purchased H&R Block Deluxe plus State. This version entitles me to 5 free federal e-files. It allows me to print and mail as many returns as I want, there is no limit on printing.

One state software is included in the package but the package does NOT include free e-file for the state return (see one exception below). If you want to e-file your state return you will need to pay a fee of $19.95 to e-file each state return. Alternatively, you can print all the forms and mail them using US post office without any additional fees. If you need to file taxes for an additional state, each additional state is $39.95 plus $19.95 e-file fee.

Note: NY state residents can e-file state returns for free.

 GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until mid January of 2015.

 Pet Peeve: H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version. That would have been useful.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations. Last year I had to do both and I found the guidance in Deluxe package was sufficient to complete the forms.

 Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on "learn more" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.

 H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

 DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC. You no longer need to enter this information on H&R web site. I prefer having this information locally on my PC for better security. It suggests reasonable prices based on condition of the donated item and it is nice not to have to come up with what is reasonable on my own.

 Pet Peeve: I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

 I usually purchase tax software as early as possible to help me with end year tax planning. However, if timing is not important to you be aware that the price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter "Amazon price history alert" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word camel in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached. During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $44.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.

 For folks trying to download State Forms. The state forms are not available as of 11/30/2014. You have an option of entering email where you will be notified as soon as the form for your state becomes available. Alternatively, you can go to H&R website, hover (do not click) "Download Software" on the top banner and select "State Editions". Currently it says "Please check back in mid January 2015".

When the state forms became available and I clicked to start the download the entire program disappears for about a minute (I thought it crashed), but then the download screen appeared and the program continued normally.

 At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

 Sometimes I want to return to some section of my return. The best way to jump to any section directly without navigating through other pages is to use "take me to" button which is displayed at the top of every page, on the same line as H&R Block banner.

This H&R Block Deluxe includes only the federal tax return (no State).  This version entitles a person to 5 free federal e-files.  The program allows to print any number of returns without limits, and if you decide to mail returns (instead of e-filing) there no additional fees.

' IDENTIFY THEFT AND TAX RETURNS

'  Last year there were many reports of thieves filing fraudulent tax returns using stolen social security numbers
If this happens the person who tries to file their own  tax return gets the following error:

IRS records show the spouse's Social Security number (SSN) on this return is the same as the primary taxpayer's SSN on another return already filed this year. Double-check your spouse's SSN. Fix any issues and e-file again. Otherwise, you'll have to file a paper return.

What to do if this happens?
1. Call HRB told them of the issue (1-800-472-5625)
2. Call IRS (1-800-829-1040) had them flag the SS#

I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. I keep coming back because it works well for the tax forms I need to do and it is less expensive than TurboTax. If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.

Ali Julia review
I just finished my preliminary tax return and happy to report that I have not encountered any problems. Overall, the interface looks very similar to last year.  I purchased the H&R Deluxe + State, but the Federal portion is identical, so I am reposting the Federal portion of the review for reference here.

I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both H&R Block and TurboTax to compare. I found that both programs satisfied my needs but H&R Block costs consistently less. I have been buying the Deluxe version of H&R Block because it covers it the mutual funds sales and cost basis calculations are included (Schedule D) and the form for Foreign Tax Credit from mutual funds is present (Form 1116). To get this functionality in TurboTax you need to buy the Premium version of the software.

The price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter "Amazon price history alert" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word "camel" (repeated 3 times) in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached. During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $34.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.

' INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
' I had no problems with my install. However in 2013 I helped a friend resolve an install problem on a Windows 8 PC us installing from a CD. I am including what we did again as I know a few people told me in helped with 2014 install. Normally the automatic install runs a file called "tcauto.exe". This file in turn calls another program located under "installers" directory which actually does the work. We were able to by-pass the error by executing the exe program in the installers directory directly, this year it should be called "HR_Block_Tax_Software_2015_Deluxe__State_-_Windows_CD.exe" (it is the only file in that directory).

' If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

' If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you download it. The key-code can be located several ways.
Option 1: In the past when my download finished the install started automatically and offered me a choice of two links "View Keys" and "Install".
Option 2: This year the install did not start automatically so I clicked on the install program myself, and on the first screen it asked for "Activation code". When I purchased the software Amazon sent me a message which included a Product Code (note that they did not call it Activation code) which is the number I needed.
Option 3: You can locate it in your Amazon account:
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

' If you have a virus scanner it will generate an alert the first time you run the program, change the permission to "Permit Always" otherwise the program will be blocked.

' Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs?
I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic "Installing Software on Another Computer"
I quote the FAQ answer below:
"There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.
Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer.
Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.
The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, "Can I install the software on a second computer?"
Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate.
You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation."

' GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until mid January of 2016.

' Pet Peeve: H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version. That would have been useful.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations.

' Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on "learn more" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.

' H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

One state software is included in the package but the package does NOT include free e-file for the state return (see one exception below). If you want to e-file  your state return you will need to pay a fee of $19.95 to e-file each state return. Alternatively, you can print all the forms and mail them using US post office.  If you need to file taxes for an additional state, each additional state is $39.95 plus $19.95 e-file fee.  Ouch!

 I usually purchase tax software as early as possible to help me with end year tax planning.

When the state forms will become available they can be downloaded by selecting the State Tab and then clicking on the button labelled "Buy" (a little scary since we already paid for it) but then "buy" will turn into "update" and the forms will be downloaded to your computer.

 Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.

I found that TurboTax did not do anything better than TaxCut while costing consistently more. In addition, I like the option of being able to file 5 free Federal e-files as I do taxes for other relatives who are less computer savvy.

If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution.

I just finished a preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until January 10, 2013.
Note that I purchased H&R Block Deluxe plus State, and in this review I am including only the review of the federal forms. The federal forms part of the product are identical, of course, whether one buys the State add-on or not.

1. H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary.
It would have better if they waited until the financial information is entered and offered the Premium version only to those for whom it might make sense.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividents, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

2. As of 11/19/2012 videos for tax law changes were not available yet (the prompt said coming soon).

3. Minor pet peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on "learn more" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which words to use locate the relevant topics.

4. Good news: DeductionPro 2012 is now integrated into H&R Block, you no longer need to go to H&R web site.

5. H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example from mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

6. Copy and Paste from Interview screens is not possible. Sometimes I wish to do it for some issue as a reminder to myself. My solution is to do PrintScreen (holding ctl key, shift key, and PrintScreen key at the same time). This generates an image of the screen, which I paste into paint or photo editing software which I can print or save for later.

7. I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

8. I use large font option on my monitor display and in the past had display issues (some things were displayed on top of each other). This year all forms displayed properly with this option. Nice!

9. H&R Block Deluxe entitles you to 5 free federal state e-files.

10. The price on this package changes day to day. I found a nice tools that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter "price history alert" in Google it will come up at the top, it has the word camel in the name. I find this tool very helpful. I just looked up that the price last year during the tax preparation season hit the $20 mark on three different dates. You can set up an alert tool to email you when your desired price has been reached.

11. A note about digital download key-code
-----------------------------------------
I run into a glitch a solution to which I want to include

After I installed the software and started it for the first time it prompted me to enter a key-code. The prompt said that I should have received in the email after purchasing the software, however the email I received from Amazon did not contained a key-code. I had to call Amazon support and they told me that this information can be found following these steps
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

12. Update 12/10/2012.  I received a question if H&R allows to install the software on two PCs.  I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic "Installing Software on Another Computer"

 There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.
  Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer.
  Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.
  The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, "Can I install the software on a second computer?"
  Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate.
  You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail.
  Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

13. Update 12/18/2012.  Adding another answer to great question to share with everyone.
Q:  Is there an audit check which marks problems with red flags?
A:  At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags , and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

14. Update 2/7/2013. I received a question if I had any problem doing updates of the software.
I have performed several updates without problems.  If you have a firewall, the firewall prompts with a question if you trust the software and you need to reply "yes". If you say no, the install will be rolled back.  If you accidentally reply "No" to this prompt, I would recommend uninstalling the software. Then installing it again, and then trying another update.  Alternatively you can deactivate the firewall during the install.

I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. The interview process is helpful in reminding you things you might have forgotten. 2012 H&R Block package addressed a couple of my old pet peeves (for example, integration with DeductionPro). So I am quite pleased with it and recommend it!

Ali Julia review
I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both TaxCut and TurboTax to compare. I found that TurboTax did not do anything better than TaxCut while costing consistently more. In addition, I like the option of being able to file 5 free Federal e-files as I do taxes for other relatives who are less computer savvy.  The files with the return are recognized by both Windows PC and Mac.  The data can be imported from a return made on PC computer by copying the files to the Mac and then importing them.

H&R Block software also wins if compared to the free on-line options. I don't like using the on-line tax programs for two reasons (1) I don't want my financial data to be on someone's web site (2) free offers include the Federal tax only.

This year I used a digital download for the first time rather than a boxed version. I liked the security of having a physical CD in case I need to re-install on another computer several years down the road. But you are supposed to be able to download the software again to a different computer and when the boxed version was not available I went digital.

Downloading the software was easy, however during the install I got an error registering the software.  When I started the software it immediately gave me a prompt to enter a key-code which (the prompt said) I should have received in the email after purchasing the software.  The email I received from Amazon contained no such key-code.  I had to call Amazon support and they told me that this information can be found following these steps
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

Once this was done the rest of the software functions well. In fact it looked more polished than in prior years. I always had minor display problems because I use large fonts and they never scaled quite right.  This year everything displayed perfectly.

I read one review which mentioned a problem with seeing selection boxes.  The problem there most likely caused by low screen resolution.  Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher.  At a lower resolution, there will be problem with display such as not seeing selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

I did a preliminary tax return and below are my observations.

1. H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary.

2. Copy and Paste from Interview screens is not possible. Sometimes I wish to do it for some issue as a reminder to myself. My solution is to do PrintScreen (holding ctl key, shift key, and PrintScreen key at the same time). This generates an image of the screen, which I paste into paint or photo editing software which I can print or save for later.

3. I don't use the default location for the tax returns, as I want to my backup program to back up only the data not the software itself. The software does not  initially remember this new location on startup, it tells me I have no returns.  I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it does remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

4. Some forms (such as foreign tax credit over the limit to be directly on 1040) require entering data manually.  This year the foreign tax credit form is some what automated, when you hit next button it takes you to the next place on the form you need to fill out (last your you were just presented the form to fill out on your own). This form is not that hard to do manually as this form does not change year to year.

5. I use large font option on my monitor display and in the past had display issues (some things were displayed on top of each other). This year all forms displayed properly with this option. This is the first time in all the years I've used H&R Block software that I have no complaint about the display and did not need to change my monitor settings just to do the tax preparation. Nice!

6. H&R Block charges $19.95 to e-file each state return. Of course, this charge can be avoided by printing the forms and mailing them in.

7. In prior years the package include DeductionPro software. This year, like last year, this software is only available as an online tool. I will not use software that requires me to put my financial data on their site, and DeductionPro wants to import the data to H&R web site, so I will not be using it. Disappointing.

8. The price on this package changes day to day. I found a nice tools that shows history of Amazon prices and allows you to generate an email alert when the price reaches our desired price range.  If you enter "price history alert" in Google it will come up at the top, it has the word camel in the name.  I find this tool very helpful.  I purchased this package for $31, last year I saw the prices fluctuate between $25 and the list price of $44.99.

9.  For folks trying to download State Forms before January 16, 2012. The state forms are not available for download until January 16 for most states.
If you go to the Software Update Center on H&R website you will see a section called State Updates. Under there you there is a link called "Forms Available". If you click on that, it will show a table that shows availability of forms for each State.  Right now (last checked on 1/6/2011) none of them are available.  I called about my state (Massachusetts) and they told me that most state forms will become available for download on January 16. In the software package, select State Tab and click the button that is called "Buy"  (a little scary since we already paid for it) but then "buy"  will turn into "update" and when the forms will become available they will be downloaded to your computer.

10. ** ERROR ALERT ** 1/16/12 Version of Massachusetts state return contained an error that was corrected in 1/24/12 update.
If you owed taxes on your 2010 State return and paid owed tax in 2011, this payment was incorrectly included in Line 36 on the MA Form 1 as an amount withheld in 2011. This overstates the amount paid to the State for the 2011 tax year. This error has been reported to H&R and corrected in 1/24/12 update.

I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. The interview process is helpful in reminding you things you might have forgotten. On-line help is useful.  2011 H&R Block package appears more polished and has a number of improvements to a couple of small pet peeves I had in the past.  So I am quite pleased with it and recommend it!

I originally wrote this review thinking that TaxCut did something wrong in calculating home depreciation for my wife's home business that was started and stopped in 2004.  However, I got an email from the IRS today stating that I cannot claim home depreciation for businesses placed in service and disposed of in 2004.

Pub 946, Page 6 under 'Excepted Property'

To check to see if TaxCut would calculate it correctly if I said I started the businessin 2003, I went back to the interview and changed my business start date to 1/12/2003.  After I did this TaxCut correctly calculated my depreciation as expected.

That was the only issue I had with TaxCut.  And this is not really an issue since TaxCut was right all along.  Kudos to TaxCut for covering all the details, unlike their competitor, TurboTax, which I found 2 major bugs in their software that they try to deny. One bug is that TurboTax gave me the home depreciation credit for my part year business.  This is not correct according to Pub 946.  I would have increased my chances of being audited by Uncle Sam if I filled with TurboTax.

I am so glad I was able to return TurboTax back to the store and exchange it for TaxCut.  TaxCut blows TurboTax out the water.  I will never even think about purchasing TurboTax again, they think their software is perfect, when really its not.  Then when you report errors, they tell you, that YOU did something wrong.

TaxCut gets an B+, with my only complaint being that the interview could be a bit more decriptive and tell you EXACTLY what is happening to the figures you type in to it.  If it had done that in I never would have questioned why I didn't get a home depreciation credit in the first place.

In hindsight, I think I may have wasted my money on Complete Home & Business.  I think I could have sufficed with TaxCut Platinum, since the only business we had last year was a home daycare.  TurboTax didn't even prompt me to use the business CD that was included.  Oh well, theres always EBAY.  And also I did need to use "Ask a Tax Advisor" for some help.  And I well get a rebate of the cost since I bought "Complete Home & Business".  In either case, this software still blows that TurboTax crap out the water, it follows all the tax laws and does all calculations correctly; at least in my case.
I have been a loyal Turbotax user for years and decided to tryout TaxCut this year.  I was EXTREMELY unhappy after last year's fiasco where Intuit installed Spyware without users knowledge in order to cutdown on copyright infringement of their product.  Unfortunately, they ticked off the loyal users like myself.  I believe they have lost/will lose more sales based on that fiasco than they could've possibly saved by catching a few people trying to copyright infringe!

Anyway, I was impressed with TaxCut especially for the price.  I paid about 40% less for TaxCut Deluxe & TaxCut State than I would have paid for Turbotax Deluxe & Turbotax State.

For the most part, the programs are very similar.  TaxCut does the usual interview process just like Turbotax and it makes it very easy to work with.  Where TaxCut needs a bit more polish is in the fine details.  Missing was the ability to save your tax returns into Adobe Acrobat format.  I love that feature in Turbotax and really missed it.

In addition, I had a little trouble with form 4767 because I claim deductions for a home office and sold my house/moved this year.  It worked out after some reading of the help file and IRS.gov site, but it could've been more intuitive.

Other than those couple of items, I was very happy with the program(s).  I ran my return through Turbotax's website (without purchasing or filing it) and the numbers came out the same so I am satisfied with the accuracy of the software as well.  Overall I'm glad I switched to TaxCut this year.  I doubt I'll look at Turbotax in the future.

Taxcut is easy to use and my return is relatively simple, so I was mostly satisfied with it.  Contrary to  previous reviews, it does have an interview feature and I did not find that I had to enter the same information repeatedly.
On the downside, the program is full of bugs that range from the amusing (like saying "I see that your spouse also moved this year" when I am filing a single return!) to the scary (like forcing me to enter a value for a mortgage deduction when I do not own a home)  I run a small home based business and that seemed to extend Taxcut's capability to the maximum.  Taxcut worked fine this year, but if my business grows any larger,I'll switch to something else next year.

I've had problems with TurboTax in the past.  TurboTax 2001 would crash periodically during updates, and there was other flaky behavior as well (a "yes" button that behaved like a "no" button for example).  After reading the reviews of TurboTax 2002 and the included spyware (and YES IT IS spyware, this is not a myth), I was happy to try TaxCut instead.  It imported my 2001 TurboTax information without any problems, and I completed my taxes without any glitches.  Combine this with the cheaper pricetag, and I can safely say I am very happy I made the switch.  In fact, I'm telling everyone I know to do the same, as I think it's important to send a message to Inuit LOUD AND CLEAR that adware and spyware cannot be tolerated.

Deduction Pro is great! I it is a breeze to install and use. I was able to enter the information for each item I was donating to local charities and it really added up! I was able to type in cash giving, mileage, and medical deductions as well.  It not only gave you the total for the donations but it calculated how it would impact your tax liability. The 2005 version is not old, it is for 2005 or 2006. The program updates to the 2006 deduction rates via the internet. I hope they come out with a 2007-08 version!

The best! I have loved this software for 3 ownerships of the company which started it. Best in class as far as I have seen.
Generally easy to understand and input. Links to where things go/went are difficult to identify and navigate, making an understanding of what's happening "behind the scenes" sometimes mysterious. Still, probably best on the market.
I use this software every year. I like the import feature from other software as well as previous year's returns (if you used the same software before). The questions are on target and the guarantee is the best I've seen in the market. I like the IRS Audit feature and the fact that an Enrolled Agent will be provided should you be contacted by the IRS. The best refund guarantee is another feature that places this software above its peers.
I have been using this software for years.  I have tried the other guys software and in my opinion this is the easiest to use and it gives the best results.
This tax software is one of the best in the market comparable to Turbo tax for less. Good bang for the buck!
Best and easiest tax software on the market.  Been using it for years.
Always the easiest. Always the best.
I found this to be a better and easier to understand product than the other well known tax software on the market.  I switched to it last year and actually enjoyed using it, which I rarely say about doing taxes.  Amazon specials were the best price on this product.  I also loved the menu maneuverability and the fact that it downloads a file for constant reference on my desktop.
Best software on the market!
Best program on the market!

Rousing applause for H&R Block for not taking advantage of TurboTax's misguided and deceptive marketing by increasing their pricing. But, in fact offering a 50% discount on the Deluxe version which still supports schedule D and direct access to the forms!  All for $21!

Have been a loyal TurboTax user since the mid 90's but have now been forced to switch.  Even though I had 100's of stock transactions I have always been able to use TurboTax Basic to do my taxes, not needing all of the bells and whistles of the other versions.  Now it would cost $90 because I would have to buy the Premiere edition.  They have destroyed the trust of their loyal customers with a single stupid marketing strategy that must have been approved by a committee of clowns!

Kudos to all of the negative TurboTax reviewers to alert the public of this Intuit scam.  Keeping others from learning that they now have purchased the wrong product in the middle of trying to finish their taxes.  The dark side of me hopes that Intuit learns its lesson by losing its carefully built market share to H&R Block.  Apparently they must relearn the importance of customer loyalty and not scamming the very people that have supported them for decades.
I was a loyal TurboTax customer for many years -- in fact my earliest versions of MacInTax are now legal drinking age. But when Intuit decided to change their pricing scheme and force me to upgrade from Basic to Home & Office to file some of the schedules I needed, I like thousands of others, decided to switch to H&R Block this year. H&R Block Deluxe worked fine -- it imported all my data from 2013 perfectly. H&R Block doesn't have as good of a user interface compared with TT, but it doesn't have those annoying "upsale" offers like TT either. Considering it was approx $70 less than the comparable product from Intuit, it was a no-brainer for me. I'm very happy with the product, my federal refund was safely deposited in my bank account several weeks ago and I plan to remain an H&R customer from this point forward ... or until they decide to make a bone-head marketing decision like Intuit.
Left TurboTax after 15 years. They lost a very loyal customer by removing basic features and requiring me to buy a much more expensive version of their SW. Switched to H&R Deluxe and it imported my old TTax files and ran without a hitch. It is a leaner SW program and so it runs faster than TTax. Handled all of my income and deduction issues without any problems. I am never going back to TurboTax and will stay with H&R unless they pull the same idiotic stunt that TurboTax did. Do yourself and your wallet a favor - dump TurboTax and get the cheaper and better H&R software. You will not look back.
I switched from TurboTax Basic to H&R Block Basic last year due to Intuit's second cheesy attempt to squeeze their customers for a ridiculous amount of money.

This year it looks like H&R Block Basic is about half the price of TurboTax Basic. Beautiful. I'm still waiting for some 1099's, but I've already started my taxes by importing my W-2. Easy. Looks exactly like last year and that went really well. So, I'm going to take the liberty to five star this now since last year's experience was an easy 5 stars.

How does this software compare to TurboTax? It's just as easy. It mostly works in the same way as TurboTax with small differences here and there. The interface is much snappier than the 2013 version of TurboTax - the last version of TurboTax I used.

If I may take a moment to bash Intuit (the makers of TurboTax): That company actively lobbies against making tax filing easy. Just Google "TurboTax Lobbies Lawmakers to Keep Tax Code Complicated" for an ABC News article on the subject.

I wouldn't have even of realized this if Intuit hadn't of tried to gouge customers last year. I have a lot of ill will towards Intuit now and I was previously a happy long time customer.
I have been using Turbotax for over a decade, but no more. Intuit seems to suffer from a bit of hubris with their recent changes to the Deluxe version of TT - and then to (unsuccessfully) explain it away as good for the customer. H&R Block saw past that as did many past TT users...read the reviews. I have now abandoned Turbotax since I don't like the rationalized deception proffered by Intuit. I still use Quicken, and have since version 1, but it too seems to suffer from quality issues - read those reviews as well -  so I upgrade only when I have to. And Intuit says I have to every three years whether I like it or not.
I switched to this product after TurboTax pulled the ugly rip-off this year. I am very happy that I dumped TT and tried H&R Block. It is easy to use - I had no problem with it whatsoever. The interface is not as slick-looking at with TurboTax, but in some ways this simplicity is refreshing after so many years using TurboTax.

I had a bunch of 1099-B, 1099-DIV, 1099-INT, and 1099-MISC as well as a 1098, and everything was imported directly from our financial institutions, and everything worked without a hitch. It would have cost me a whole lot more to process all these forms with TurboTax with their shameful upsell strategy.

Overall, I am quite glad that I made this switch to this product, both to save money and punish TurboTax. I plan to stick with H&R Block next year unless TurboTax makes a huge about-face next year and lowers its price drastically, which is unlikely to happen.
I have purchased a copy of TurboTax every January for years. This year I noticed that it had thousands of 1-star reviews (what?!) and almost all of the 5-star reviews seem fake (they're written by people who either reviewed every single TT platform, or reviewed nothing but 3 other products all on the same day.) So first of all - thanks fellow-Amazon-users, for a helpful heads-up.

On to the software - I actually really like it! The interface is easier to get around than TT and it's more visually appealing. It imported my TT info with no problems. I'm self-employed and those worksheets and forms were slightly less awful than I'm used to (still a confusing nightmare, in my opinion). H&RB has its own version of ItsDeductible which is really helpful. The best part though, is that it seems to be the exact same software as the old TT Deluxe, except less expensive. Sorry TurboTax, you lost another long-time customer.
I have been a TurboTax user for probably close to 15 yrs or more.  But this year, Intuit decided to become deceptive and tricky with their pricing structure, in effect, raising their prices for the average home user and home business user by probably 25% to 30%.  I didn't calculate the exact difference, but it was absurd.  They say their structure makes it simpler for the user to decide which version to use.  Bull pucky.  It's all about the money.  Bad decision on their part.  As you do a little research on the subject matter, you will see that there has been a mass exodus from TurboTax to H&R Block software.  As well as to other brands.  This version of H&R Block that I got was just as easy to use as TT, and a lot cheaper.  I would probably go back to TT in the future if they come to their senses, but it's only because I have used their software so long that it has become a standard.  But then again, maybe this will be the new standard.
I have used TurboTax for the last ten years or so, but because of the pricing and content issues already well documented in these comments, I decided to consider switching to Block.  After enough research to assure myself that others were having good experiences with Block, I decided to give it a try.  The 2014 Deluxe version of Block easily uploaded my prior years information from TurboTax (Whew!  Off to a good start).  The series of tax related questions that followed seemed more direct and less encumbered with advertising and urges to upgrade than the TurboTax version.  Overall, I am very pleased with the 2014 Deluxe version of the HR Block tax software.  Will be using them again next year.

I also use Quickbooks, which has been an excellent product from the same company (Intuit) that publishes TurboTax.  Unfortunately, Intuit has been taking aggressive steps to reduce the capacity of my QB so I would have to "upgrade," e.g., they terminated my ability to download/upload information directly from my bank.  Seems to me that Intuit is pushing too aggressively to force users to spend more money on their products - wanting to make more money is ok; it's what drives our system, but Intuit has developed a pattern of being sneaky and devious in their tactics.  I would not be so upset with them if they were charging more and delivering more, but they seem to be sneaking up on users, e.g., TurboTax 2014 doesn't really tell you what you are missing in 2014 (that was included in 2013 and previous years), until you are at a point in the preparation of your return where it is tempting to submit, pay the extra $40 and move on.  I am very glad that I made the switch to Block this year and I hope enough others switch that TurboTax gets the message.  Thank you HR Block.
As a longtime TurboTax user, I changed to HRB this year because of TT's huge customer misstep in changing features and pricing. Although this product is new to me, last year's returns imported easily and so far, the learning curve has been minimal. HRB seems to be solid, the guides very effective and I will likely remain a customer next year, despite TT's attempt to reverse the loyal customer damage they created. I do miss Intuit's It's Deductible and ability to enter my contributions during the year, but overall, the product is great!

O YEA!  Love H&R Block.  Have rentals, am stock speculator and am a tax pro beyond usual tax pros in the sense that my experience includes but is not limited to IRS Tax Examiner, Tele Contact Rep, Revenue Officer and GS13/10 Analyst.  Did a two year stint as an Enrolled Agent.  One would hope that USAA Fed Sav Bank would pair up with H&R to create a Investment Portfolio download that is convenient but alas, USAA has gone ho-palloi.  One is unable to tell the difference between USAA and the Bank of So-Average.  Keep H&R Block -- scrap USAA Investments.  By the way --  H&R has a HEART!  They provided me at NO CHARGE  access to a tax filing year I needed when my WWII Army 3rd Division Hero Father passed.  H&R telephone contact reps are absolutely wonderful and pull out ALL the STOPS to provide the ultimate in elevated Customer Service.
LOVE the "shoebox" tool!
Great exprience, very convenient and cost effective. I love it, will do it again. Better than buying the product from store
This is an old stand-by for me.  I've used this software and its progenitor, TaxCut, since it was published by MECA in 1988.  A simple and effective tool.
love it as much as you could love doing taxes -  very happy with this.
generally effective but if you have K-1's with passive loss carryovers, it can have problems.  Also losses with not as much at risk as the loss.
Love this software.  Does an awesome job on my personal, business partnership return and 990 for the Vol. Fire Department return.
I love it as much as one can actually love tax software, kind of like a five star enema. :)
# 1.  I got my order on the 3rd day from the day I ordered (regular mail) what is better than that.
# 2.  Brand-New and very low price.
# 3.  Love it, Love it.
# 4.  Thank you!
Awesome product as always, I but it every year, it covers all my needs.

Alright, people, this isn't perfect, but I like the price much better than Turbotax's (TT) offerings that do the home taxes and a business/partnerships/trusts.  I can get 10-15 lattes with the savings.

I started the returns in March just before I took off for the Pacific Crest Trail. I filed extensions and then completed partnership returns in the week before I left.  I went hiking and my tax returns were outa sight and outa mind.  After walking 1600 miles, I honored "fight-Procrastination day" a day late, but hey I did it.  I used some of yesterday to finish the personal return and revised one of the partnerships early this a.m.  No real difficulty, but just a new way to navigate the return.  If TT or HR Block kept their navigation same from year to year, it wouldn't matter.  I'd still have to relearn it every year.  I'll count myself lucky if I haven't killed the hundred million brain cells responsible for learning this stuff.

In the Review phase where the software looks for dumb things I did, it highlighted "errors" and permitted me to see where I'd have to make corrections.  Mostly ok, but, some of them led to forms irrelevant to my return (I'm no accountant, but I need plain English explanations.  I deleted those forms, crossing my fingers)  Other "errors" had no explanation for how they got there, nor any definitions.  This was no different for TurboTax in the years I used TT.

Efiling my personal return went without a hitch, though I have yet to discover if the IRS accepted the return.

I don't need the software to import data from last year's return.  I'm not re-inventing rocket science every year--it's just a tax return.  I just don't need to pay some accountant $3,000 to do this and still demand the same amount of time as me using the software.  Either this or TT beats the ##%! out of that or trying to do it with the doggone forms all over the kitchen table.
I find the middling (sometimes harsh) reviews of H&R products interesting. I used TurboTax for years but was put off by last years shenanigans. I snagged both TaxAct and Block for 2014, liked (not loved) them both and found all yielded similar results on three different returns. The UX is different on each product; some will be a better match than others depending on your needs/likes. I ultimately opted for Block Deluxe as I only wanted to mess with one tax product for 2015.

So far the experience has been mostly positive having worked through two fairly basic and one modestly complex return. Screens are clear, data input easy, navigation intuitive. Guidance in most cases is concise and useful. There is always room for improvement; plenty of reviews that call out specifics. For me it gets the job done in a straight forward, mostly 'bling free' manner. No dancing bunnies or pop-up personalities trying to provide 'helpful' assistance at every turn. Yes - there are a few up-sell screens but they are modest offers that some may appreciate. I'm ok with that. They do not constantly reappear or try to scare/shame you into an additional purchase.

That said, H&R Block may not be the right product if your return is complex or you need plenty of hand holding (although it could provide a useful start if you use Block's walk-in services). Be aware import capabilities are limited to their own products; it would not read my TaxAct or TurboTax files. However, the financial institution import worked well with minimal delay (looking at you TurboTax). Post filing status communications are good with limited/no upsell attempts. At least so far ...
I needed to open an older tax return file and I didn't have the original software.  This review is basically for the vendor that delivered exactly the advertised product at a low price and in a timely fashion.

I purchased this product.

I used this product. It is good for someone with Knowledge of the tax code or someone who knows his way around the forms.

I purchased this product for two reasons:
1.  It was less than turbo tax.
2.  I had previously used it.

It was very straightforward and efficient.  It came close to what I wanted to accomplish.

But, in the end I needed additional aid with my multiple and rollover Stock transactions.  I was not able to locate my paperwork for these.  Therefor I was in a jam.  I also ended up getting turbotax.

The Turbo tax is has an automated feature in it that allows you to get the research history and do the computations for all the mulitple entries.

Conclusion:

PRO:
1. Good Product.
2. Well Priced.
3. Does what it says.
4. Stable.

Cons:
1.  It is for the experienced user and the one that does not have significant detailed transactions(or for the one who is not organized enough with his papwerwork.)
2.  Requires deeper understanding of the forms and there True functionalities.
3.  Lacking some additional "features"/"widgets" for the normal/inexperienced user.

Don't let the claims form the other products fool you.

The base of this product came from Kiplinger's tax cut, a well known and extremely trusted financial adviser.

Yes, H&R may have made a few changes that may make you think  that this product has declined in quality.  But I can assure you the core and original intent of Kiplinger's product is still here.

Very good product for the "normal" tax payer. Schedule C info is very good but some of the intricacies of LLC and S-Corp fillings are a bit harder to understand and the questions are not as clear as they should be.

Bottom line, if you own a home and you have mortgage and/or a sole propitiership, this is top notch 5 stars. If you recently formed an LLC and are looking towards this product I would strongly recommend you speak to a tax professional ( A CPA not one of the chain stores) instead.

I have used H&R Block's TaxCut program (predecessor to H&R Block at Home) for several years and have been very pleased - it does a good job, and is easy to navigate.

This year I ordered H&R Block at Home that was clearly labeled as being a CD, requiring a CD-ROM drive; that is exactly what I have - a CD drive, but not a DVD drive.  When it arrived, I put the CD (or what looked like a CD) in the drive, but it did not open, even though the drive acted like it was opening the program.  When I checked the properties (by right-clicking the drive), it showed that the CD was completely full, meaning that the CD had been "burned" as having a program but contained "0 bytes."  A tech guru also tried it, with the same result; then he put it in a laptop's DVD drive, opened it and copied the program to a flash drive, then installed that on my computer.

So, even though Amazon's info listed the program as being a CD, and even though the printed box that the program came in also listed the program as being a CD, it was actually a DVD and had been "burned" as a DVD.  Those people who have a DVD drive on their computer might not ever notice the difference, but for those of us who have only a CD drive, it is a critical difference.  The fault here is not with Amazon; instead the fault is with whoever actually "burned" the CD's for H&R Block.

As for the program that the guru got installed on my computer, it worked great; I e-filed my tax return yesterday with no apparent problems!
As another customer looking for alternatives to TT since they changed their Deluxe product, I was looking at H&R Block Deluxe. The H&R Tax Software packaging is not real clear on whether you can import your financial data. YES you can! Its a little hard to find, here is a list of participating financial institutions. http://community.hrblock.com/t5/DIY-Products/Is-the-Deluxe-edition-capable-of-extracting-stock-sale/m-p/55807/highlight/True#.VLBIb010zlY.

I wrote a scathing review of the 2013 product, and some of it still applies -- but see below for a workaround in the 2014 product.

I invest at Betterment. COM, where I made two sales and once changed my stock/bond percentages. To me that was 3 transactions, but to H&R Block and the IRS it's at least sixty, maybe a hundred. The program downloads that information from Betterment -- no problem! But then it FORCES me to "confirm" every one of them individually. That means clicking "edit" next to each one that has an exclamation point (all of them -- several hundred entries) and clicking "Next" anywhere from two to five times, depending.

There's no effin' way I can actually CONFIRM all those details -- I have to trust Betterment. But H&R Block does not, so it will take an hour or two to do what's supposed to be "automatic". All of this for a total of $97 in capital gains and $5 in disallowed short sales.

In the 2013 product, after "confirming" each transaction, H&R Block brought me back to the top of the list, where I had to scroll down, down, down, down, down (yawn), down, down, down to find a transaction not yet "confirmed". This made an annoying situation even worse.

In the 2014 product, another user found that he could essentially ignore all those ! marks and he was able to e-file without "confirming" those transactions. I have not filed as yet, but I have successfully passed the "error checking" phase.

There are still some annoying "error checks" that shouldn't be needed, but the product is basically OK.

I have used Turbo Tax for the last decade.

  I royally screwed up my taxes by contributing too much to HSA accounts for both my wife and I over the last five years.  We had separate HSA accounts through our employers, and I contributed the maximum for individual and my wife contributed maximum for family for five years.  Only until year five did TT's  warning seem ominous enough for me to look into this excess contribution that we were supposedly making.

  I know, I'm an idiot for not knowing that since we both had HSA accounts that we were limited to just a family deduction.  Regardless, it was my fault, and I was paying a 6% tax on this money every year until I knew it was there.  Finally, I was able to pull it out of our HSA accounts as excess contributions and was ready to move on with my life.  TT could not calculate this withdrawal...

 I spent  several days talking with support experts who recommended several "workarounds" (since TT could not calculate correctly, according to the experts) that ended up giving me a large tax return instead of the taxes that I should have been paying (There are multiple posts dating back at least three years as to the ineffectiveness of TT software dealing with HSA's). I spent  a week  working on this!

In the mean time, I googled my problem, and it came up with a review from Amazon that mentioned my problem in it's context and that H&R block's tax software took care of his problem (It was actually a wide ranging, informative, well put together review... unlike this one.)  I figured I would give H&R block a try while I worked through my problems with TT, as I was almost done with my taxes except for this one HUGE problem.  H&R was able to download my previous TT tax return, which made things a little quicker.  When I got to the HSA section I entered my info and was pretty irritated that it wasn't calculating it correctly either... or so I thought!  I expected a big hassle like I got at TT, having to alter numbers, and make it "work".  I entered my 1099-SA amounts and it calculated it perfectly and took away the excess contribution which TT was unable to do!

 I think Turbo Tax is easier to work with, but I think the calculations may be more accurate with H&R. If you have an HSA I would definitely use H&R!
(Note: This review also shows up in the reviews for the download version.  Don't ask me why Amazon doesn't show the reviews in both places for what's really the same product, with just different delivery mechanisms.  I bought the box version, if you want to know.)

This part written Dec 9, 2009 (see updated comments below)

This is of course a preliminary review (written Dec 9 based on use in the last few days). At this time one can't do more than a rough cut estimate of the tax return -- the IRS forms aren't finalized, the state forms aren't available, and of course the various income reports (W2, 1099, etc.) aren't out yet.

I don't have a super complicated tax situation this year: it just requires some things that a good tax program should handle easily. So far this program seems to do just fine. I found it easy to use, and found that imports from Quicken and from TXF files worked without any problems. Schedules A, B, and D worked just fine, and the related screens were easy to use and understand. Excess FICA was calculated correctly, as was the child tax credit. The AMT calculation does of course remain weirdly complicated (once a year I mutter to myself about all politicians in DC), but the program does take care of it with no apparent problems.

I used TaxCut last year -- chose it over TurboTax just because of cost, and was quite satisfied. I'm not convinced this year either that you get value for the extra you pay for TT. (Incidentally, note that if you have investment income you probably need to get TT Premium, so the price would be nearly double that of HRB Deluxe.)

A warning I wrote in my review last year seems worth repeating: Don't expect a tax program to apply tax laws correctly in all circumstances; for anything at all out of the ordinary, make sure you double-check against an IRS guide or another guide like JK Lasser's. The folks who design and write and test the programs make mistakes, too. And for the same reason, give the calculations a sanity check, don't just use the program blindly, or you could get tripped up by a software bug that wasn't caught.

I will update this review in Jan/Feb when I've had a chance to do more with it.

Update Jan 29, 2010:

I have now done a first complete pass on my taxes, based on W2s, 1099s, and some projected 1099s.  I also have had an opportunity to use TurboTax Deluxe (I got a free copy, legally), so have been able to compare the two products.

I continue to like HRB Deluxe.  It's easy to use, and has been trouble-free.  There are a couple of things I particularly like, that might be worth mentioning.  (1) They show you when the next update is expected, so you don't waste your time running the update check until there is something.  (2) Entering info from interest paying mutual funds that might have muni income (tax-free for Fed) is simple: HRB gives you a simple way to enter the amount that's tax-free in your state, and takes care of it without hassle.  TT can also deal with this, but I don't like their way as much (they create a separate 1099 to split the income into two parts).

Interestingly, TTD is also noticeably slower starting up than HRBD.  Don't know why.

The one advantage TT does have over HRB is on coverage of automated downloads: TT can download your 1099 info from a larger set of institutions than can HRB.  W2 downloads look the same between the two.  This does save some time, and could be sufficient to be a decider for some.  Not for me.
(Note: This review also shows up in the reviews for the download version. Don't ask me why Amazon doesn't show the reviews in both places for what's really the same product, with just different delivery mechanisms. I bought the box version, if you want to know.)

This part written Dec 9, 2009 (see updated comments below)

This is of course a preliminary review (written Dec 9 based on use in the last few days). At this time one can't do more than a rough cut estimate of the tax return -- the IRS forms aren't finalized, the state forms aren't available, and of course the various income reports (W2, 1099, etc.) aren't out yet.

I don't have a super complicated tax situation this year: it just requires some things that a good tax program should handle easily. So far this program seems to do just fine. I found it easy to use, and found that imports from Quicken and from TXF files worked without any problems. Schedules A, B, and D worked just fine, and the related screens were easy to use and understand. Excess FICA was calculated correctly, as was the child tax credit. The AMT calculation does of course remain weirdly complicated (once a year I mutter to myself about all politicians in DC), but the program does take care of it with no apparent problems.

I used TaxCut last year -- chose it over TurboTax just because of cost, and was quite satisfied. I'm not convinced this year either that you get value for the extra you pay for TT. (Incidentally, note that if you have investment income you probably need to get TT Premium, so the price would be nearly double that of HRB Deluxe.)

This year, H&R Block was a complete failure for me! Apparently my health care situation fell in a HUGE hole. I am over 65 and covered by Medicare. My wife is much younger and has marketplace coverage. This seemed to throw H&R Block a curve. The program refused to accept the situation and offered no workaround. It would not allow me to file at all. In frustration, I redid my return using Turbo Tax online. Turbo Tax had no problem with this and worked fine. H&R Block was simply a waste of money!
Mostly HRB's Deluxe '13 tax was similar to Turbo Tax's Deluxe tax software, with the exception in how it didn't handle an adjustment to bond income which was 'earned and taxed in the prior year,' but not received till '13, as reported to IRS.
It would not accept the negative adjustment entry.  After several attempts, it gave a pop-up suggestion to enter as two separate entries for income and adjustment, but again rejected the negative adjustment.
(That leaves one to either not make the adjustment, or do the adjustment prior to entering the income, supposedly.)
Missed earned income credit when going through program (said not eligible and was incorrect), had to file addendum.  Also a hassle for energy credit, wants to idiot proof to much and not allow editing, if 2 people in house you can only take half credit HH&&R, wake up, there's a lot of co-habitating now.  Sheesh, that was a headache.
Performed as expected.  Ive been using it for around a decade now.  I manage complex stock trades that issue K-1 forms as well as own real estate.  It handles them nicely.
This year, you will pay a big tax penalty if you didn't have health coverage for 2015. IMPORTANT* This program factors in the penalty at the beginning, so if your like me and you are looking at your refund amount, it will look significantly lower until the end of the process when you verify that you had health coverage. For me, this was very confusing. I spent like an hour or more redoing my taxes, because the refund amount seemed way off. It isn't till the very end that you figure out that it's low, because they penalize you for Obama care until you prove you have it.

Otherwise I like the H&R program. I have used it for years. I can't give it 5 stars because you have the hidden cost of paying for additional state e-file programs and additional amounts to efile your state returns. Otherwise it's all good ''''
The price was right compared to having your return prepared in a H&R Block office.

The software was easy to use and worked well. Having been a professional tax preparer at H&R Block for 21 years may have been why I felt the software was easy to use and the step by step guide through your return was simple to follow.

Two improvements could be made however. I had expected the software to search H&R Block's internal database and pro-forma my last year return which I filed at the office I worked at last year. They have all the data on-line and it is available in my "My Block" account on-line. Why not suck it in when starting this years return.

Another thing that disappointed me was the way the program calculated our Georgia retirement exclusion. When dividend income, interest income, capital gains and rental income were entered on the Federal return it was designated as taxpayer, spouse or joint. When calculating the retirement exclusion for Georgia all were credited to the taxpayer. To maximize our retirement exclusion I had to use a calculator and go back to the source documents and the Federal return to apply the amounts properly. It ought to be simple to keep track of who the income belongs to, our office software did a fine job of taking care of that.

I'll probably buy the software again next year but had expected more from Block this year.
Happy with it. just a little difficult where the health insurance stuff comes into play. But it is first year for Obamba health care.

I have prepared my taxes using H&R Block's Deluxe tax software package for many years and find it works well, is intuitive and has no glaring flaws or software bugs. I'm posting a review before my purchase this year because I couldn't help but notice that Amazon seems to be trying to generate consumer bias for specific tax software bundles that benefit Amazon, and that's not so cool. The only versions of the H&R Block's tax software available as a download this year are those that include the Amazon 10% Refund Bonus Offer (i.e. if you use a portion of your refund to purchase Amazon gift cards, they will tack on "up to" 10% more); and in the case of the Deluxe Federal Only version, the one with the Amazon tie-in costs less as well ($24.97 versus $29.95 at the time of this review).

If you already planned to spend your refund on Amazon gift cards, that's a great deal, but this marketing method tries to sway you to do so whether you'd intended to or not. Sure, you can get the downloadable version and choose not to take advantage of the gift card bonus when it comes up in the tax prep dialogue, but who's going to pass up that carrot once it is there in your face?

Amazon incentives aside, shouldn't ALL online software purchases be available via download in 2016? Beardo thinks so.

Have tried for 3 months to buy my tax software only to get none stop refusals to ship stating they can't ship to my address.  I have given three legal physical and 1 legal mailing address and yet they still refuse.  I was directed to download then refused a download saying it was not available.  Again - AMAZON SUCKS!!!
When I finished, I unexpectedly was offered a 10% of my refund Amazon gift card, which I accepted. 
I did have to take essentially all of the rest of my refund as an Amazon gift card as well. Of course, we have the 5% rebate Amazon Store Card, too, and can't use that at the same time, so it's about a wash.
I have been using TaxCut since the early 1990's when it came on a floppy disk!  Several years ago TaxCut started sending me a DVD in late December with instructions on how to buy an activation code to use.  Every year the price has gone up with them asking around $50 for this very package this year.  So I decided to wait and along comes Amazon.com with an offer of $21.99 for the very same product in digital download form.  I went for it.  To me, this is a good price for what I need.  I cannot justify paying double this price and apparently H&R Block and Amazon are still making a profit on this product at $21.99 so I will more than likely be waiting for an Amazon.com deal before buying the 2014 edition next year.
I was told by Amazon that I would receive my product on January 3rd.  I received it today, December 27th!!  How could I ask for better service from this seller?????  GREAT SELLER a+++++++

I use the H&R Block software every year because it offers the refund bonus offer when you receive your refund as a gift card. It's important to note that this year, Amazon was the only gift card option while in the past they have offered a wider variety of retailers.

I do my own tax return, mainly because I have complex tax situations...more than 5 schedule K-1 from various LLC investments (including 2 oil drilling investments with complex tax codes), more than 10 rental properties, more than 5 stock trading accounts...etc. First of all, not all the tax-filer have the related experience or knowledge to handle my tax return. Or it will cost me a fortune for an experienced CPA to do my tax return.

I was using Turbo tax initially, but I didn't find special advantage in Turbo Tax when comparing with H&R's Tax Cut. So, I switched over to Tax Cut, and I have been using H&R tax cut for the past 8 years. It's not only cheaper, but also capable of handling my tax return's needs. It has an easy interview process to guide people to enter information. It also allow me to fetch specific form to allow manual modifications. I can also do quite some if-else analysis to assess different tax strategies with it. Also, the cost of purchasing additional state tax packages is low (I have rental properties in various states that require me to file multiple state tax returns.).

To my experience, both Turbo Tax and Tax Cut are not much difference in functions and capabilities. But I would recommend Tax Cut for its value.
I always buy H&R Block at the beginning of each year. As I found out H&R Block and Amazon always have a 50% discount at the beginning of each year for this software. For the past couple of years, I monitored this H&R Block SW price and I haven't found better price than this 50% discount. Here are my purchase record for the past couple of years.

I have purchased Tax Cut for many years and have found it to be very accurate and easy to use.  In reaction to a promo price for Turbo Tax, I decided to purchase it to complete my tax returns this year.

As I needed to complete both personal and corporate tax returns I purchased the Turbo Tax "Home and Business" product.  Upon installing the program I found it clumsy and awkward to navigate.  I also realized that to complete the corporate return I would have to buy the Turbo Tax Business program as well (the Home and Business version doesn't cover corporations!).

Needless to say, I returned Turbo Tax and went back to Tax Cut Home and Business.  I find the Tax Cut product much easier to use and navigate.  Its also a much better deal ($45.49 at Amazon) versus the two Turbo Tax programs I would have needed to buy($60.00 for Home and Business PLUS $52.99 for the Business version).
I find no issue in this software.  I have been using Turbo Tax for many years but last year I started to have my own business and needed a tax software for my corporation and one for my family personal tax.  Turbo Tax price just back me off...  too expensive!  So I switched to H&R Block which is only 1/3 of TurboTax price. This software did the same stuff Turbo Tax does for home.  And for those who worried that it does not transfer last yr data (from Turbo Tax) into current yr ~ H&R Block DO support Turbo Tax and it DOES pick all prior year data into current year filing and all personal information so NO need to input everything all over.
For business, it's somewhat complicated but I think it's difficult in general (that's why most business need to hired a tax general to do their tax) esp this is my first time doing business tax.  I have to spend long hours searching internet to answer questions on filing business tax and what tax forms do I need for my corporation.  At last, I am able to do it.  I never use Turbo Tax on business tax filing so nothing to compare, but money wise, I will go with H&R Block At Home.
We have been using HR Block Premium + Business Tax  software for years and this 2015 version is excellent and  easy to use.  The companion state software is not yet available until later January 7, 2016.  HR Blocks usually delays downloads of state tax software until the state has provided current up to date State tax law information.  Other reviewers comments about companion State tax not being available or not import compatible are premature.  We also have adult children just finishing college. This HR Block Premium + Business Tax software provides  a great training  ground for children to do their own taxes and file their own returns.  With  the capability to file  five federal tax electronic submits without extra charges, this software  meets our families needs. Our children started their own small business  last year and this software has allowed them to import  data from last year, HR Block Premium + Business Tax tax returns and complete the federal tax forms on their own.  So as a parent of two young adults headed out on their own, HR Block Premium + Business Tax software is a breath of fresh air.
I'd been using Tax-Cut since 1998 on MAC platforms.  Tax-Cut abandoned MAC users for 2005 taxes, so I was forced to Turbo-Tax.  This was a pain because I had to re-enter information from scratch, as opposed to reading in from the prior year.  I found turbo-tax not any better than Tax-cut in 2005. I have a mix of self employment incomes, some rent etc, requiring lots of forms but I am no business owner.

For 2006, I emailed TaxCut to see if the '06 software could read the MAC '04 resturns.  Answer=NO.  So, I was going to use Turbo-Tax again.  However, Turbo-Tax had done the dirty this year, and divided their premium software by forms (schedule C, then rentals), so I'd have to buy the most expensive "small business" Turbo-Tax software, as opposed to just the premium package (even though other reviewers note that its not really for small business).  The price differential of the Schedule C Turbo-Tax, with Tax-Cut is really very large.  On the other hand, returning to the Tax-Cut web-site is omenous in that the "FAQ" and software demonstration portions are "To be developed".  However, I don't like monopolies, so I decided to give Tax-Cut another try, figuring I can go back  and buy Turbo-Tax if necessary.

I haven't seriously started '06 taxes yet, but I am pleasantly surprised with '06 Tax-cut Premium Federal + State. It looks to be the same as the MAC '04 version.  Better still, it actually read in a bunch of simple '05 Turbo-Tax returns from my minor children.  However, it could not read my '05 Turbo Tax return for some reason (will try some more).  Having not expected to be able to read in any of last years data however, I feel I am at least ahead to some extent.

There are complaints by other purchasers about new e-filing charges for Tax-Cut.  I don't e-file, so I am unaffected.  If the IRS wants a 30-page return with circular nonsensical computations that are so complax that we are forced to buy software and a computer to process it, then they should have the courtesy to read those 30-pages.  You would think we should get a tax-break for e-filing, or the IRS would pay e-filing charges considering the effort it must save.

Bottom line: This will work.  If you don't want a Turbo-Tax monopoly, this is a choice.
This was my first time using H&R Block software, after using Turbo Tax the prior year.  The H&R Block software is less expensive and frankly in my opinion, easier to use than the incumbent Turbo Tax software.  In addition, this software will also import your personal and tax information directly from Turbo Tax, if you used it before.  I definitely recommend this software over Turbo Tax and I will be purchasing it again to file taxes for my wife and I.
I've been using H & R Block tax software for business tax returns since they purchased Kiplinger.  It is the least expensive tax software I have found to do the six business tax returns I do each year plus my personal return.  There is definitely room for improvement.  Sometimes there is an error message in the review and it isn't clear how to fix it.  I've have my yearly frustrations, but seem to push through and get everything filed on time.  I used other tax software in the past and have had similar frustrations, so I don't attribute it to the tax software, more to my lack of knowledge.  But with a little research I always find the answer.
Switched from Turbo Tax to H&R Block for our 2014 taxes.  I have a 4-year degree in accounting and 1 year I paid someone to do our taxes.  He screwed up and I have to file an amended return.  I decided never again.  I started using Turbo Tax because that was what my brother uses for our family construction company and his taxes.  After the epic fail with the new release by Turbo Tax for 2014 I thought I'd give H&R Block a try.  My Turbo Tax return came over as did all our information.  The step by step process of filling out the tax return wasn't any easier than Turbo Tax, nor would I say it was harder; just different, especially after using Turbo Tax for 4 years.  But with the lower price for H&R Block I think I can learn to adjust.

buy it every year and it transfers my data from year to year, smoothly and quickly.  Would have rated 5, but help isn't as helpful as we'd like. Finally had to contact the 'live help' and after several minutes of chatting back and forth and answering questions from the rep, was told that they aren't able to answer that type of question ... which they should have just told us when we first asked the question at the beginning of the chat session.  Otherwise, the interview is pretty quick and easy ... just don't try and fill in any of the forms yourself or it seems to mess everything up.  :)
I started using this for the first time this year because of the brain dead shenanigans being pulled by the folks who did TurboTax.
I must say right now I am impressed.
It mostly looks like any other tax software out there, but I noticed right away that the question/answer session seems to be a lot more well laid out. The questions are easier to understand. Granted, I am no dummy when it comes to finance software, but a lot of people are, and I can see this being a huge advantage for other folks.
Probably the best thing though is the price. ...

I have used this program in its various incarnations, from Tax Cut to whatever it's called this year.  As my life has gone from being single to married to having a house and kids it has made doing my taxes easy.  The questions are pretty straightforward, and as I've used it year after year it just imports a lot of the data entry from last year's forms (Social Security Numbers, W-2 ID numbers and the like).  Download was a snap.  I especially like the state option, as Vermont's tax system has gotten more and more complex and requires more and more forms.  Asking for the IRS to mail me a check, it took a few weeks but I had it by March 1.

Every year I've thought about jumping ship to Turbo Tax, and then I read a slew of reviews keeping me here.  Very early on, Tax Cut found me a $1,500 deduction/refund that I would never have thought of getting, so I still ride the positive emotions of that "find" as I click away at the questions.

That said, I have a sneaking suspicion I'm missing something.  Perhaps it's the middle class fear that the system is set up to rip me off, but in not having a personal tax accountant I worry that my money is not working hard enough for me, and that I am missing thousands in deductions without realizing it.  Some of my friends tell stories of their accountant and what they tell them is "okay" to deduct, which gets me thinking.  For the first time, I've thought of going and getting a review.  Still, a friend goes into the H & R Block offices and, from what he describes, it sounds like the guy behind the desk just goes through the same prompts as this.  Indeed, the program is so easy I find myself in a kind of haze and, in the end, its so easy I think I must have missing something because taxes are supposed to hurt, right?  There's research about how our brain makes choices based on the difficulties of the decision, and I fear the ease of this program is leading me to think my finances are nothing of consequence and I'll miss mistakes.  Yes, my Luddite mind is over thinking things.  I think I'm just bugged by the tax code, and wish we had a flat tax at this point.

This suspicion, and the changing name of the program, is why I only give it four stars.  If you are not paranoid, you would probably give it five.
Ok, this is the first tax software I've tried. Up until now I stuck with books, PDF forms and a BIG bottle of tylenol. I just finished my return and e-filed it, and I have to say this was the easiest round of taxes yet.

The pros - the initial interview questions seemed to hit everything needed to get most of the info done before hitting the returns. While answering questions TaxCut offered tips and explainations for everyting. If the explaination didn't show the help or explaination link helped figure things out. Overall the the process was pretty painless and was finished rather quickly.

The cons - You have to know a little about your returns for the error checking part. There might be something that needs verifying or an error to correct. If your not familiar with your returns the area that needs adjusting could be strange or confusing. The other is the begining interview questions. While they are complete if your not use to tax software the order of questions can be confusing. Best advise just stick with it and all will be well.

I'd recommend this product to others to use, it worked for me.  Granted my return doesn't do a lot of deduction actrobatics (I have wages, mortgage, student loan interest, savings interest and a divident to contend with). If your return is really complicated I'd say take it to someone...besides that complicated and you probably can afford to do so!...LOL
I have to admit, I am not a happy camper when tax time rolls around.  It takes awhile to complete my taxes.  However, H&R Block's tax software has been the easiest and safest way to complete anyone's taxes.  I have been using this software for a few years and I am here to tell you that as time goes on, they always seem to improve on the product, little tweak here and a little tweak there.  They incorporate all the newest rules and regulations as quickly as possible with their updates so it would be hard to do your taxes wrong.  They guarantee you will do it right and if you get audited, and the IRS finds a mistake... they will be right there for you.  This is a safe guarantee I personally have been eased by over the years of using the software.  I know no one likes doing their taxes, I know I don't, but H&R Block will make it easy to do them.  They walk you through many issues you may have and recommend whatever form you will need.  For those who are looking for software to help with tax season, I highly recommend them.
I usually go to H&R Block to do my taxes. This year, I had more time and was more familiar with my taxes so I decided to do it myself with the help of their software program (and save some money).

PROS:
First, the software was surprisingly easy to download and get started. I was thinking it would be a headache. It took minutes and went smoothly.

Second, their interface is user friendly. They guide you through the process with questions as if you were in an office talking to a tax preparer (they call it interviews).

After a little time getting to know the software, I found it very easy to see where I can look for answers to questions or go back and change my data.

Lastly, and most importantly, the program leads you through all your deductions so you don't leave anything out. And their accuracy review was very thorough. They even asked me to go back and mark a checkbox I missed.

It made me feel confident that when I e-filed, I was filing an accurate form.

Also, I did use their Chat service to field a complicated question, and that helped me considerably in doing my taxes correctly. I think that service adds a lot of value for the price of a software program.

CONS:

Yes, you do pay that extra $19.99 if you want to efile your state taxes (which I didn't mind but wanted to point it out so people know that will be there). I also had to do some research on my own to answer a tax question for the state so it seems more thorough for federal. The research I did actually helped me understand the tax issue better so perhaps that was for the best. I am more informed on the issue.

To sum up:

Yes, I recommend this program. I even enjoyed using it! Next year, depending on my time, I'd either use this program or go to their offices and have them do it. Either way, I will feel confident that I have my taxes done accurately and will get a good return.
I have been using H & R Block software for many years, and it always gets the job done. This software leads you through doing the tax return in an interview format, asking one question at a time in a way that has logical flow to it.  Sometimes it feels a little clunky to navigate around a tax return to make corrections after going through the interview on the first run.  But I really like the interview format that the software leads you through -- it makes doing taxes so much less overwhelming to only have one question to answer at a time.  Of course it makes comprehensive corrections with each edit of any particular number -- waaaay easier than filling the forms out by hand.

I also have a lot of confidence in following H & R Block's tax information -- they are such a huge player in the world of income taxes; if H & R Block says it, the IRS will surely agree.  I also really love the Deduction Pro software.  It is kind of a pain to use; but I appreciate valuing my charitable in-kind donations (like the kind going to the thrift store) using the software.  Again, if H & R Block says that my donated t-shirt is worth $5 and my kind-of worn slippers are worth $3.50, I have confidence that the IRS will agree -- it is not just my own little say-so, it is H & R Block's!
This way pretty straight forward/easy to use. The only thing that could be better is sometimes when you have a question about a type of deduction, the guide doesn't really answer your question. You end up having to do your own research with the IRS procedures which can be a real pain.
As much as I HATE tax time this software certainly makes it easier for a self-employed business owner to do so. If you're good with keeping receipts the interview takes you through the whole process fairly easily and quickly. I find it helpful to pull all the receipts together then go section by section to answer the questions. I especially like the "goto" feature which makes it easy to back and change info when additional receipts are found. :)

What's not to like?
 It's cheaper that TurboTax, and does the same thing. Imports from financial software, does an "interview-style" return, imports last year's info, the usual stuff. Also allows e-file (you pay extra) and will support EFT to/from the IRS-- if you owe them money, you can have it sent on 4/15/04 and not pay any sooner than you need to.
 My return is complex, but it handled it well. Just as good as the competitor, and about five bucks less. Also a great rebate offer w/ MSFT Money; basically get Money '04 for free. I'm sold, I'm satisifed, and I'll be back next year.
 Four starts since it's just bare bones, but at this price, what do you want? I say don't bother paying for the extra movies and advisor stuff.

Thank you for a great review, C. MacPhail. For a record, today the price dipped to $18.99 :)  NY state e-filing is free, as it becomes a mandatory this year. So if you file for NY state only, it will be only $18.99! Very cheap compared to Turbotax.

For everybody's consideration, I share my two cents as I happened to try all THREE major filing methods this year: an accountant, Turbotax(online trial version), and, H&R block software (a free promotion CD as I was a user in past). My conclusion is, all has pros and cons, you will need to pay your own attention to be accurate as possible, because none of them are perfect - just C. MacPhail and others said.

My accountant I hired was clearly wrong in a few tricky areas (bank interests, part-time state residency etc) which were originally the reasons why I initially intended to work with her this year - I've filed only with software before - to save the time for research/worries on those things. Why I found she was wrong? Because I used a free, promotional H&R Block software this year (it was mailed to me) to compare side by side as well as Turbotax's free draft online just in case. I know I'm a bit unusual, but at the same time I was so curious how much she could save money more than software - it turned out to be opposite! She came back with $1700 state PAYMENT while both software said $2500 REFUND. This is a too big difference to ignore.

Of course less refund does not mean incorrect, she could be right, the most importance is accuracy than more refund, so I even researched on IRS/state websites, tax advice websites and H&R block and Turbotax articles, and confirmed that my accountant was absolutely wrong and I was shocked how much a professional could be wrong; I could be filing wrongly for less refund, I pay more fee than software, then I might get audited so I have to hire an accountant again to represent?! So crazy. She was definitely acting professionally and caring in terms of communication, took time to explain why she did this, and nice enough to let me go without charging at all stating she was not comfortable in my case. But when her knowledge is wrong, that's wrong, I can't trust her work. I also found she was not particularly proactive to suggest any tax saving tips/questions either as she is already busy with her other clients...

So I'd say, if you don't want to worry or don't have a time at all for DIY, your tax situation is way complicated, AND if you have found a great accountant you can trust, the high price for accountants worth it. I thought I carefully selected this accountant by interviewing several ones based on people's recommendations/Yelp reviews, confirming she said she could handle my situations before hiring her, but still her job was wrong where I concerned, and she gave up on my case at end. Maybe it is my fault choosing her, but she does have a good background/experience/reviews on my resume!!!

For tax tips, I feel software definitely does a better job (the problem is that you have to understand and translate into your case by yourself; this is where accountants are supposed to be better when they knows your situation inside out and have a time to care and ask). I'd say, if you are fairly confident with software and go by price, H&R block software is definitely an winner. Turbotax does have more sophisticated user interface (as suggested in C. MacPhail's review), but H&R block software did suggest some tax tip better than Turbotax while H&R block made me nervous when it lets me get in actual form to enter numbers, in my case.

If you could, try both before paying, and go for which you felt comfortable. The both software is comparable, it is really a personal preference and convenience. You could try an accountant too like I did, but remember, we could get audited/get errors even if we pay more $$$ to the accountant. Since there will be always a chance to get audited with any method, why don't we go for software which is cheaper and actually more time-saving if you are an worried type like me. Good luck and happy tax filing!
This is just so easy to use and worth the money, been using it forever (it seems like forever anyway) and I love it, don't see the need to go anywhere else because it simply does what I need it to do and I get my refund quickly.
This was the second one of the two big popular tax program. It's much cheaper and does the job. It has gotten better every year.  I always use it. The main area it could improve is handling the state. I still get tripped up on one thing or two every year with the state. These last two years, it doesn't transfer the fact that a state tax free bond is state tax free, from the federal to the state well.  You have to hunt around and go into the forms. Other than an occasional little thing, usually a "special":  (rare) item, it works extremely well and is well worth saving the money not buying the more expensive competitor.
Advice more succinct and less demeaning than Turbo Tax.  Fails to differentiate itself in the handling of investments and does not handle new high-deductible health savings accounts well (does not let you view the form and offers little advice or direction), which are my drivers for buying the more expensive Deluxe package.
I tried the Taxcut this year because Turboax marketing was confusing.  This is how I read : Turbotax Basic version does all, but if you want to maximize deduction for home, then you need to get Dlx version.  And if you invested in stocks, and interested in maximizing deduction... you need more expensive & better product.  What kind of marketing crap is that?  Taxcut, single package does it all.  Only difference is efiling support and state tax. Took me 4 hours to do my tax (home owner with 100+ stock sales data) and it was well worth the money.

I have been doing my own taxes since 1953 including those for my electrical contracting business.  I have taken numerous college level tax courses and at one time was a certified California tax preparer.  For me Tax Cut is easy to work with and does it all very nicely with lots of good references.  I stopped using Turbo Tax because the company got greedy.

Thankfully, I was able to heed the advice of many former Turbo Tax users and purchase Tax Cut right off the bat.
Tax Cut works wonderfully, and I experienced no problems in installing or using the problems.  A very seamless operation, indeed.
To those who are skittish about switching to Tax Cut (i.e. afraid of change or the unknown) let me assure you, Tax Cut works just as well as Turbo Tax, but without the added problems of installation and operation.  I say this, as a former Turbo Tax user from way back when it was part of Parsons Technology.
I give Tax Cut a big Five Stars!  And the Turbo Tax people need to take notice here.  In fact, I think it's the whole Intuit culture that needs to be changed, when they try to foister outrageous things upon their users (Intuit QuickBooks users:  remember when they forced you to 'subscribe' to the payroll tax tables and gave you no choice otherwise?).
