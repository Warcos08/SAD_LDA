This game is hilarious! I am writing this review after two hours of playing for the first time.(1) In the "conductor" mode, you're expected to waive the baton to conduct an orchestra. The music seems simple, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, but it was arranged beautifully. The woodwind begins quietly then strings take over. Keep on waiving your baton, or if you stop, the musicians give you a strange look. The tune continues with brass, rapid string counter melody, and ends with alternating timpani and a cymbal blast. The second orchestra piece is Carmen, which can be played fast-slow-fast with a dramatic ending.(2) In the jam session, you choose the musical instrument, song, style (pop, calypso, March, Hawaiian, etc) and whether you want to be the melody, bass, harmony, or percussions. There are numerous instruments to select but there four basic ways to control or "play" them: piano control, guitar control, violin control and trumpet control.(3) In the improvisation mode, you just pick the instrument and start playing. The computer will help you with the accompaniments such as bass and drums. The melody seems to be random notes matching simple chord progressions in minor or major key. To make more fun, certain buttons add more functionality to the game depending on the musical instruments. For example, when you play guitar, use button C to play a chord, instead of a single note. When playing recorder, press B to make a trill (trill is a technique to produce two quick repeated notes).(4) The video mode enables you to record your performance and share it with your Wii friends. The game comes with four prerecorded video clips from the factory.(5) Pitch Perfect is a fun game to test your hearing and pitch recognition. For example, you are asked to arrange the Miis playing low note to high note, or you have to select two Miis playing a harmony among three Miis on the screen.Conclusion: unlike other game which emphasizes pressing color coded buttons, this game is more on the musical side. The song selections are mostly public domain music and not as many as Guitar Hero because it is not necessary to have hundred of music library to enjoy music. A simple repertoire like Twinkle Twinkle Little Star can be arranged in limitless ways as long as you're creative. Even Mozart created a variation of this popular French tune.
...and not surprisingly, it's well done and a lot of fun.The phenomenom of rhythm- and music-based games has been going strong in Japan since Dance Dance Revolution hit arcades there in the mid to late 1990s.  Even today you'll find arcades packed with games where you can play guitar, be a DJ, play a huge taiko drum, play a trap set or any number of other variations.  Not to mention, each of these games has many (sometimes dozens) of home versions.Unfortunately, with the exception of DDR, these games are hard to find in the U.S, at the arcade and at home.  Only recently are developers starting to realize the profit potential of a genre that appeals to all ages and both genders.So here we have Donkey Konga, Nintendo's first rhythm game, and it comes with a pair of bongos - a good deal for $50.  The bad news is that, despite looking like bongos, they don't play like bongos.  The heads are rubbery and soft, not tight like real bongos, and they don't make a bongo sound, except through your TV speakers.  So if you had planned to jam on these sans GameCube, forget it.The good news is the game is competent and a lot more challenging than I thought it would be, given the "kiddie" premise.  There are about 30 songs, which, unlike the J-pop and original songs in DDR, will be familiar to almost everyone.  I especially like the classical music and the new versions of old Nintendo theme songs.  There's also oldies, swing, pop and rock.Basically, like any rhythm game, the goal is to watch scrolling symbols and hit the drum at the right time - either one or the other, both at once, or clap your hands together (or, easier, slap the side of the drums).  Surprisingly, even the middle level (equivalent to "standard" in DDR) has some pretty tough songs.  Even if you can pass them, you'll have trouble getting all "greats" (equivalent to "perfect" in DDR).The only thing I'm really wanting in this game is perhaps a bigger songlist.  Thirty songs will get mighty boring after too long, I predict.  But I'm hoping this won't be the last game to utilize the bongos - and I hope it sells well enough to convince other developers to make rhythm games.

I love the recent string (no pun intended) of musical games coming out from Guitar Hero to Rock Band.  Problem is, those kits are flippin' expensive and I'm not too keen on storing either plastic guitars or bulky drum sets.  Don't get me wrong, I own them anyway but lugging them to a friend's house is no fun task.Enter Wii Music.Wii music is pantomime meets Rock Band.  The bulk of the game revolves around the player mimicking gestures to simulate sound according to the actual song being played as the notes are hit automatically unless the player's timing is off.  The player does this up to six different instruments to simulate melody, bass, percussion etc.  When the player is done, he or she can make a CD jacket to label the track and make a music video of it.  On top of this, there are three minigames.1:  Wii Conductor.  Move your arms similar to a conductor to make an orchestra go.2:  Hand bells like the ones some people use in Christmas musicals or church services.3:  Music quiz thingy similar to the memorization game on Wii Play.That's it!  That is, in a nutshell, the entire game.While the game itself is simplistic, that is also the idea.  Nintendo, in it's grand scheme of marketing to the casual gaming audience, has created a very simple, yet elegant, game to allow the player to easily mimic music without real lessons or going nuts while trying to play Through the Fire and Flames on Guitar Hero 3.  In doing so, Nintendo has appealed to anyone who desires a musical experience but either A) doesn't have the time to master easy, medium, hard, and extreme mode and/or B) does not have at least $80 to spend on a Guitar Hero set.  All that is needed is at least one full Wii remote and nunchuck set although more sets with more players make it more fun.While up to six instruments may participate in a song, only four players can go at a time although this does not mean the player can record tracks for all six instruments.  This means four people at a time can go nuts with over 60 instruments including cowbell (which we all know we need more of), a DJ turntable, recorder, flute, sitar, and much more.This game is very addicting.  My graduate students friends are playing the game in my apartment as I type this, not only having a blast but hogging the darn TV in the process.  They're hooked on Ode to Joy, which we arranged with sleigh bells, a flute, and a clarinet.  When working on my thesis for more than five hours at a time gnaws at my brain, I love saddling up the Wii and playing Twinkle Twinkle on the piano.Now, with all the goodies in Wii Music there are a few drawbacks especially with the sound and selected songs.  Unlike Guitar Hero, Wii Music's musical selection is mostly derived from the public domain track list.  This means it's very generic songs like Twinkle Twinkle, Yankie Doodle, Ode to Joy, and Swan Lake.  This constitutes the bulk of the soundtrack.  There are a few good licensed songs like September by Earth, Wind, and Fire along with Loco-Motion.  The real songs that everyone bought Wii Music to play are the Nintendo mixes like Legend of Zelda and the Mario Bros Theme Song.  Unfortunately, there are only seven Nintendo songs and of that only three are any good (the aforementioned two and F Zero Mute City).The soundtrack could have been soooo much better even with more licensed songs by Nintendo such as Castlevania, Star Fox, Metroid, and Paperboy.  Anything would've been better than the ragtag bunch of songs from Europe that were used.  Not to mention they could've used some greater public domain songs like Greensleeves or Battle Hymn of the Republic.The next con is the sound itself.  While the majority of the woodwinds and drums sound magnificent, several other instruments do not.  The most notable bad sounding instruments are the trumpet, saxophone, violin, and viola.  Don't even get me started on the more... interesting instruments like the cheerleader, the black belt, cat and dog suit, and the rapper.  Those wacky things seemed to have carried over from Mario Paint despite a 15 year gap.  While having an all-male cheerleading squad sing the Legend of Zelda theme song was disturbingly amusing, I would never be so bold as to show that in public.The only other cons are basic Nintendo ones such as the use of weird instructional characters.  The Maestro instructor looks and talks like a more flamboyant homosexual version of Beaker from the Muppets.  The other issue is how the remote distinguishes movement for the cursor and that of the instrument itself.  It can get very annoying but I find that if I want to switch, just hold the remote in front of the TV for two seconds and the cursor switches over from the instrument.All in all, Wii Music is a really fun game for the whole family and your friends if you've consumed enough alcohol... seriously.  I give it a solid A- as it fully utilizes the Wii interface but lacks in some sound and musical selection issues.  It's too bad you can't really go heavy metal... *sigh* party on Wayne!
This games is so great!  The bongos add to the fun.  Even though you can play the game Donkey Konga with a regular controller, it wouldn't be nearly as fun without the bongos.  The bongos are very durable, and you can adjust the sensitivity of them.  The only thing that may cause a problem is when playing with a group of people, your bongo may register someone elses clap and interfere with your turn.  But, adjusting the sensitivity should correct the problem.  If you are interested in music, this game will definitely help with keeping up with beats, weather the notes are half notes or whole notes, you will learn how to play them.  Future games like Donkey Kong Jungle Beat (which is an adventure game)will also use the bongos. I highly recommend this toy.  It will bring family and friends together.

When our copy of Wii Music arrived, we were a bit skeptical. Based on the summary, the game lets you play a bunch of virtual musical instruments by waving around your Wii remote and pressing buttons. I'll be honest and say that did not sound very satisfying on paper. However, after countless jam sessions, hand bell performances, symphonies, and music video recording, I can tell you that this game is incredible.Unlike most games, there is no set path and there is no right or wrong way to experience Wii Music. The game is more of a tool to allow your kids (and you) to understand music theory and foster their musical creativity. This is not done through the sadistic exercises that piano teacher from your childhood employed. Rather, the game introduces you to the basic mechanics of the various instruments and underlying concepts of music and sets you on your way.You start with about two dozen different instruments to try. As you progress through the additional lessons, games, and challenges offered, you unlock more. This process is extremely satisfying because of not only the sheer number the game offers in total (a whopping 60!), but also their variety and humor. This is a fantastic way to introduce you children to instruments they would never have the opportunity to experience otherwise. Sure, there are the expected standards like a drum set, piano, violin, trumpet and guitar, but that's just the tip of the iceberg.Ever played the djembe or taiko drums? Rocked out with a shamisen or sitar? Maybe strummed a dandy on the jaw harp? Neither had I until Wii Music. For some real laughs, you can "play" a dog or cat suit (your Mii barks or meows while dress in full costume), lay down some dope beats with your DJ turntables or beat-boxing, or just go nuts as a cheerleader yelling and shaking your pom-poms. There is enough variety here to keep your family smiling for hours.Getting to the actual music, the main mode is the "jam sessions" where you can choose your role in the band (melody, percussion, bass, etc) and play your heart out to dozens of songs from the elementary "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star" to some pop and rock classics like "Mr. Postman" or "Material Girl". Your kids are not scored, graded, or judged like other music games like Guitar Hero. They are free to play however they like, in whatever style they like. They don't have to worry about the notes they play, as the game does a surprisingly intelligent job of deciding that for them. To get a great performance, it's all about the timing, rhythm, and the gusto with which they play.The lessons mode does a fantastic job of gradually teaching them more advanced concepts of musical theory. It demonstrates how you can play the same song in different styles and how the mood of a song can change from start to finish. This serves as a great teaching tool and make the game more engaging by enabling your kids to play the same songs it an endless variety of ways.There are other modes such as music videos, hand bell performances, music quizzes (another great teaching tool), and our favorite, conductor. Conductor allows you to take control over a symphony or choir who follow your lead through a number of rousing classical numbers. Depending on the speed and tempo of your movements, the musicians will play faster, slower, louder, or softer. This is one mode that does score you and leads to some great competition. If you conduct with robot-like precision, you will not get as high of a score as you might think. You are awarded for creativity and the personality you inject into the performance.
I love the concept of the game. At first it was hard to keep up with the rhythm. But once you get the hang of it, it's smooth sailing. But my hand and wrists get tired and sore after awhile. But it does build hand, eye, and rhythm coordination. The game has a good selection of songs to pound away at. My favorite if. "Whip It". Can't wait till Jungle Beat comes out. I hope more games are developed using the bongos. My only problem with the game is that when you play with multiplayers and when they clap, it records on your bongos which can ruin your perfect streak.

In this video game based on the ingenious claymation series, Wallace and Gromit go to the West Wallaby Zoo, intending to celebrate the birthday of their young friend Archie, a baby polar bear.Unfortunately, the zoo has fallen into the dastardly hands--er, wings--of Feathers McGraw from The Wrong Trousers, who seems to have broken out of jail.  And he has taken poor little Archie hostage to boot.So now it's up to Wallace and Gromit to save all the baby animals and liberate the zoo from the evil penguin.You play as Gromit in this game, and you go through several different levels trying to save caged, baby animals.  Eventually you get various contraptions from Wallace to help you out along the way.  The graphics are really good, and the levels are complicated, but fun.  However, the second level is murder to find your way around, fun as it is.  I just barely managed to clear it myself...One of the very best things about this game is that you can unlock movie clips from the TV series and things like that.  For instance, there is a featurette about how the game developers made the game, which was really interesting.I have yet to complete the game, but I know from experience that it is really, really fun, and it's definitely worth the cost.  You may like it even if you don't know anything about the TV series.

The meat of this game is the 120 brainteasers contained, and sometimes hidden, within the Curious Village.There is an overall mystery surrounding a Golden Apple, as well as some additional mysteries happening in the village, but you will not be solving those mysteries directly.  In fact, the mysteries are so contrived they are not solvable by the game player.  Instead, the mystery solutions are revealed to you as you progress through the game.So what will you be doing? You'll be solving the brainteasers the residents of the Curious Village toss at you as you walk around investigating the mysteries.  The riddles range from very simple (10 points) to very hard (70 points).In the simplest riddles, you may only have to assemble a simple jigsaw puzzle.  In the most difficult puzzles, you will have to figure out how to place chess pieces on a chess board so that none of them cross each others' paths, yet all are able to capture any other piece placed on the chess board.This game is not for young children.  The content is family-friendly, but a great many of the riddles are unsolvable by anyone who's not at least in junior high or even high school.Although many of the puzzles are difficult, you will collect Hint Coins throughout the game.  They are hidden in many different places within the village, such as a garbage can or light pole.  Simply touching an object with the stylus will pop-up a hidden Hint Coin.  You then use these Hint Coins to buy up to 3 hints per riddle.  Note: The first hint is almost always entirely useless.  There are plenty of Hint Coins hidden in the game.  I ended the game with 85 unused Hint Coins.  I found 118 of the 120 puzzles and solved 115 of them.It's an enjoyable game, but remember, you'll be solving the riddles, not the mystery.  The mystery itself is nothing more than a backdrop and excuse to serve up riddle after riddle for the player's enjoyment, addiction, and - sometimes - frustration.
Finding this (along with a GBA game in the same case) at a swap meet at a really competitive price, I'm surprised with how deep Professor Layton's brainteasers go.  The brainchild of psychology professor Akira Tago, the game takes an English gentleman and his eager young assistant to the bizarre village of St. Mystere.  Using the stylus from your DS system, you communicate with the eccentric locals, solve the puzzles and riddles they offer, and poke around the vicinity for hidden puzzles and coins to buy hints.  You're also given a briefcase where you keep clues that'll help in the long run.  As for the puzzles themselves, you don't have to be the Riddler to solve them.  Apart from basic match skills, they test the flexibility and patience of the player; emphasis on patience.  How many of us have thrown our hands up and logged on to YouTube for answers, only to realize we could've gotten it right all along?  Actually, my sole complaint is that the animated cutscenes look much choppier from the demo I played years earlier.  Still, if you're big on brainbusters then Professor Layton and the Curious Village is definitely your cup of tea (See what I did there?).This game is rated E for Everyone.
As I have been a huge fan of the Professor Layton series ever since The Curious Village came out, naturally I got my hands on this as soon as it came out -- for I expected the pasts of Layton's nemesis Descole (villain of The Last Specter and Miracle Mask) to be revealed as well find out more about the Azran civilization. This game did not disappoint.Story: Professor Layton is invited by renowned archaeologist Professor Sycamore regarding a girl frozen for presumably over 1 million years. Upon their arrival at the frozen cave, the girl is found to be an emissary for an ancient and highly advanced Azran civilization. She requires 5 "keys" to unlock all the wisdom that the Azran left in their legacy. Having Layton and co. resolving mysteries around the world for Azran "keys" was a nice change to the same city setting in the previous games (save Diabolical Box). There are more twists in this than there are in the other games, to the point of using some cliched examples but were nonetheless engaging and astounding (I could never have guessed some of these developments).Gameplay: Per the usual, there are puzzles (150 in the main game) and several minigame puzzles for the player to solve. Upon completion of those, several harder puzzles will be open. Having played through all the Layton games, I found the puzzles in this game to be tougher than the puzzles in the other games. (I also spent more time playing this game than the others). Some puzzles are worded ambiguously but most are very well-done and would provide some challenging fun. There is also the added bonus of Daily Puzzles downloadable via Wi-Fi for an entire year.Visuals & music: Given that this is the last of the games featuring Professor Layton (Level 5 is planning a 7th game though), there are more beautifully animated cut-scenes and a wonderful soundtrack. The music in this game is my favorite in the Layton series.Overall, for fans of puzzles, adventure, and mysteries, this is a game you shouldn't miss. In addition, at the end of this game the opening sequence for The Curious Village ('07-08) is shown, making it clear that the events in this game took place before the first three Layton games released. So I would highly encourage those new to the series to play the Layton games in this order: The Last Specter -> Miracle Mask (3DS)-> Azran Legacy (3DS) -> Curious Village -> Diabolical Box -> Unwound Future.This is really a fitting end to this trilogy, and a sad parting for Professor Layton, even as he continues his adventures in Curious Village and beyond.
I've played some of the other Professor Layton games and was very excited about getting the first title, Curious Village.  I was not disappointed.  The first Professor Layton has the charm, the intracy, and the quality puzzles that I found with the other titles.  The graphics are clear and detailed, I found I very much liked the quaint little village of St. Mystere.  Stopping and solving puzzles as you walk through the story made for hours of entertainment.  My favorite puzzles in this game were a series of Princess in a Box' sliding box puzzles, which progressed from easy to very challenging over the course of the game.  I also liked the 'Rooms at the Inn' minigame, collecting furniture and decorations for the Professor and Luke's rooms, then deciding who should get what.As in all Professor Layton games, it was the detailed layering that intrigued me.  Proceed to a new scene, search for hint coins, stop and read the journal, click on character and solve his puzzle, get new gadgets for the minigames, stop and play a level of minigame, unlock a new bonus content.  So many options and so much to do before you can confidently say you've beat this game.I would recommend this game for all ages.
No matter how the game's cover may look to you, make no mistake that Professor Layton and the Curious Village is one of the best original puzzle games you'll play on the DS yet.  A combination of adventure storytelling and traditional puzzle gaming, Professor Layton never fails to entertain while providing some challenging puzzles.  The game revolves around said Professor Layton traveling to a small village with his young assistant Luke.  Both of whom are on a search for something called The Golden Apple.  To search the town, you move from one area to another by tapping the touch screen, and along the way, you can discover hidden puzzles, hint coins, and secrets, as well as interacting with the townspeople and solving more puzzles.  The game's graphics are incredibly charming, and the FMV sequences are very well done to boot.  The best part about Professor Layton and the Curious Village is that once you do beat the game and unlock the game's 120 plus puzzles, you can download weekly puzzles for absolutely free!  The only real flaw of Professor Layton and the Curious Village is that the game's music is repetitive and even kind of annoying, but you can always turn the volume of the DS down, which you might want to do.  That aside, don't let the box art fool you into thinking that this is a game just for kids.  Professor Layton and the Curious Village is an absolute must own for every puzzle loving DS owner.
I'm playing this game years after the fact because quite frankly, while I don't mind a good puzzle every now and then, it's not my favorite thing to do to pass time.  However Professor Layton's games came highly recommended, so I figured I would at least give it a shot, if nothing else than for the story.There are currently three - soon to be four - Layton games.  Think of Layton as Sherlock Holmes with puzzles.  He experiences different places and events and there is a mystery that needs to be solved underneath.  He gathers information and clues by assisting patrons with puzzles that they cannot solve.  The premise is simple, the back story was quite excellent, and I would submit that if it were not for the deep story, this would be the most average of all games.In Curious Village, Layton is on the hunt for something referred to as the Golden Apple.  He has a treasure map leading him to a mysterious village.  Upon arrival, he is trapped and cannot leave the village, so he decides to go about solving the mystery of the village.  During the stay, there are a number of strange events that lead him to solving his first mystery - patrons that end up missing.I won't spoil the story for you.  But I found the story of Curious Village to be a solid 9 out of 10, hurt only by the presence of certain events that appeared to not be relevant to the story.  The character development was done well, and it wasn't difficult to keep up with the story as it unfolded.  Where the game broke down is the implementation of the puzzles.  The puzzles themselves weren't bad, but the problem is that they were infrequently relevant to the basic story or game.  A lot were just random puzzles thrown in there with no rhyme or reason as to why.I also want to emphasize that a lot of the puzzles were not really puzzles, but actually brain teasers.  Things where the way the question is worded is a trick to the real answer.  For example (not a real puzzle in the game): "John has 26 apples.  He puts 12 of them in the fridge.  He eats one, throws away four, and gives one to his next door neighbor.  Not including the one he ate, how many does John have left?"  Technically, the answer is 24...why?  Because the four he threw away are still in the trash in his house, so technically he still "has" them.  The 12 are still on the table in his house.  The only ones left are the one he ate, which we don't count, and the one that went next door...leaving 24.  Your first instinct is to say that the answer is 8, which would be wrong, or 20, which would also be wrong.  That's an oversimplified example of some of the wordplay that abounds in Curious Village.  Those were the most annoying.  It was never that the puzzles were hard, just annoying.Solving a certain number of puzzles or greater unlocks a lot of secret dealies such as all of the cutscenes (and there are quite a few of these, short though they be).  Beating the game unlocks a code that is used in the second game, which isProfessor Layton and the Diabolical Box.  Because of this last bit, you'll want to start with Curious Village first if you're trying to see if Layton will work for you and you like puzzles that must be solved.  The third game, of course, isProfessor Layton and the Unwound Future.Where Layton stands out is the quick pickup and puzzle solving that used to be an affair for newspaper crossword puzzles.  The presence of a solid story solidifies the game even further.  It is hopeful that the developers see fit to bring over the mashup between Layton and Phoenix Wright, as I can imagine no other more epic combination.
The puzzles were interesting to do. I would take this game to restaurants and while my husband and I were waiting for our food, we'd figure out a puzzle together. But the story was tedious and I had to click past many screens as various characters had conversations with each other. It got more exciting as the action started picking up and we got into the amusement park and tower, whereas wandering around the village was getting tedious. I finally figured out to stay focused on my assignment rather than stopping to solve every puzzle I passed. There's some good websites if you get stuck on a puzzle, and even videos on YouTube which show exactly had to solve some of the trickier sliding puzzles.
I loved the game more than Curious Village....and that's saying something!!!  What a great series!  This game has Professor Layton and Luke traveling by train to solve the mystery of the Elysian Box.....which is believed to kill any who open it.* The puzzles are challenging....the music is great....the story line is intriguing.* The mini-games in this one are even better than Curious Village. The hamster maze challenge is my favorite.  There is also a tea challenge. As you go through the game,  different tea ingredients are unlocked.  Some people in the game will want a specific cup of tea (to rejuvenate them, relax them, etc.).  You have to experiment with the tea pot to find the right mix of ingredients to complete the request.  There is also a photo challenge where you are given 2 photographs and you need to try to spot the differences.  Sounds easy....buuuuuttt,  it's not.  Not all of them anyway.* Just as in Curious Village....this game has bonus puzzles that are unlocked as you progress through the game.* Additional weekly puzzles available through Wi-Fi.This game is fantastic!!! A great buy....you won't be disappointed!
I've enjoyed Nintendo DS games, but I think this is the first time I've been amazed by one.The story is quite simple: Professor Layton and his assistant have been called to a mysterious village to unravel a puzzle. A wealthy man has died, and he has offered his treasure to the one who can find the "golden apple." But everywhere Professor Layton and his assistant go in this curious village, people keep asking them to solve puzzles. Then a murder occurs--or does it?--and Professor Layton is accused. Answers seem to lie hidden in an amusement park that has not been open in ages and in a strange forbidding tower. Mystery follows mystery, but fortunately this strange town has you to solve the puzzles!The story is told in short animated pieces of high quality, the kind found in films like Spirited Away or Howl's Moving Castle. The logic puzzles themselves are quite challenging, and it's a joy to solve them. I didn't solve every single one (I think I missed two or three out of the 90 I did), but they are very good, and there are so many of them. I would NOT give this to someone who is easily frustrated, but I would recommend it to anyone who loves solving difficult logic puzzles.Sadly, after about 15 hours of having a hard time putting this down, I have finally solved the mystery of the golden apple and enjoyed the conclusion of the story. It ends with a promise that the story will continue, so I will be looking forward to the next Professor Layton game, whenever it comes out.And in the meanwhile I can still enjoy additional puzzles downloaded to my DS via a wi-fi connection.This is a great, great game!
Hello I'm an autistic adult gamer.This is my review on Professor Layton 2/Diabolical Box - DS game.Hi I'm not very good at puzzles & it takes me extremely long time to finish puzzles but I enjoy Professor Layton because of the good storyline.  I also bought the first one Professor Layton/Curious Village a while back & enjoyed it too.  But anyway's I just started on the second one Professor Layton 2/Diabolical Box ds game & am enjoying it just as much as the first one.  Not to give to much away Professor Hershel Layton's mentor is killed at the beginning.  But that's all I'm saying you have to play the rest of the game to see the rest of the storyline unravel it's self.  This is simply a good game.  By the way there making two more Professor layton games after this one for the ds.  They've already released Professor Layton 3/The last Time Travel it can be found on ebay the jap version.  The other one is just now being released over in japan Professor Layton 4/The flute of Malevolent Destiny.Get this game you'll truly enjoy it I know I am.Happy Gaming!

Take control of NBA star Kobe Bryant, and recreate all his moves. All the moves including the out of this world slams were digitized from Kobe himself!! This game is a must have. Also, another cool thing about this game is the fact that it's PA Announcer is none other than the Lakers real-life PA Announcer!! When he yells Kobe's name after a basket, and also Shaq's name after a slam, it feels like a game at Staples Center! Talk about taking control!! This is the best as it gets! This game also has an arcade mode, which is 3 on 3 basketball! It also has a 3 point shootout! Take control of three point hotshots like Pat Garrity, Reggie Miller, and the 3 point king, Peja Stojakovic!!After you win a championship with the Lakers, you can take control of the other teams in the league, along with superstar players like Tracy McGrady, Kevin Garnett, Chris Webber, Gary Payton, and others! This game also has the grizzled vets like Karl Malone, Patrick Ewing, and his Airness, plus brash rookies like Brendan Haywood, Jamaal Tinsley, and Eddie Griffin!

Does one have to really wonder why this game imprisons lives?  It rouses a fixation, depriving sleep and razing all signs of the munchies.  Advance Wars is a portable cart aimed as a tactical knock off and effectively whops the target.  Nintendo yanks out a total hit with a chronic twist.  Their multiplayer and extremely balanced Turn-Based combat has players coming back for more and more.  The replay value on this life-draining bastard is the forerunner of its class.  Either played during sessions in school, on the passenger side, with a group of aspiring Commanding Officers, or accompanied with a pungent beverage in solitude, Advance Wars scores sky-high.Igniting in robust complexity, once the battle intricacies are soaked into your instinct the game goes ka-boom!  Lodge fortitude, play through it and soon you'll see why so many have fallen for this sweet sucker.  Before the true mayhem crops up, you are launched into guided exercises.  Avoiding the crash course, newbies will acquire the essential arts for the GBA's first warfare.  Subsequent to the training missions, the player should be ready for the maximized Campaign Mode.  Centered on Turn-Based battle, the essential goal throughout the game is taking out Commanding Officers or seizing their command centers.  Wrangled on land, air, and sea, the amazing part of the game is the perfectly balanced units.  All 18, outfitted with certain stamina points, armor, movement, attack range, and accuracy, are regularly used and maintain a purpose on the frontlines.  The infantry units, while naturally deleted off the screen, are the only ones who can annex cities that are used to accrue units.  One's surroundings (mountains, forest, reefs, highways, etc.) accomplish tactical implements as well as defense, subterfuge, or greater mobility.  Operations in the Campaign Mode are ranked depending on the players speed and technique.  AW coins, used to purchase extra maps, are awarded upon the player's performance.  Moneyed with a winning single-player campaign, and the option to directly replay all the missions, Advance Wars can stand alone as a standalone buffet.  Things just take-off with its cargo of customization traits and its several other modes.  But the unfeigned incentive to protectively hold onto the GBA is the multiplayer mode.  Enabling an up-to-four-player mode and trade with customized maps, Advance Wars coaxes as a spotless multiplayer pleasure.They're pixilated and they may be the state of primitive cartoon animation, but looks can deceive, for Advance Wars doesn't behave as it appears.  A downright, every bit of tactical thinking game, the graphics are wonderful except for the overly childish atmosphere.  Tidy and viewed overhead on a large battlefield, the tiny GBA screen shines with clear-sailing sight.  The animated, no-frills cutscenes shown when units strike each other are nice for the first 30 minutes, but swamps the game in the 31st minute.  Thank you Nintendo for the option to deactivate them.  With feisty visuals and appropriately incorporated audio, you cannot go wrong with the quality.When confined into detention, jaded to death, or suffering from the gritted-teeth addiction, Advance Wars somehow materializes into my head and mysteriously onto my palms.  Levels are designed so intelligently that the action is continuously ardent, and sometimes human competition can get pretty gripping with all the sticky sweat-works.  Greatly composed, unproblematic when learnt, and every bit full of tactical grandeur, this baby is done in superiority over all others.  Its solo-player playability and its multiplayer bonanza earns its strips and undying longevity.  Boil everything down and what you catch is a grand slam and myself roaring in chock-full acclaim.

Wrestlemania X8 was developed by Yukes, who made the Smackdown series, instead of AKI who made every other wrestling game on the Nintendo 64. Yuke's did manage to improve the graphics, some. If this was an N64 game the graphics would be GREAT, but this is the Gamecube. The six different arenas (including Raw, Smackdown, Wrestlemania X8, Summer Slam, Survivor Series, and Royal Rumble) look impressive but the wrestlers look more blocky or cartoonish like in past wrestling sims on a Nintendo platform. Some look better then others and its eay to see that more time was spent on say the Undertaker then Will Regal. The gameplay is different but not bad at all. Its easy to grasp but you don't have a great deal of moves at your disposal, so it can wear a little thin especially in a long match. There are 40 match types (more than any other Nintendo wrestling game but 30 less the the PS2'S Smackdown: Just Bring It!). The cell is by far the most impressive and fun. The matches it does have are all fun except triple threat. The computer AI has a tendacy to not play fair and to gang up on you a lot in a triple threat. To me the AI is the biggest problem but in some ways adds more of challenge to winning a belt. There are four modes (five if you want ot count Options menu). Exibition where you can have any of those 40 match types with up to three other players. Next you have Path of the Champion, which is like story mode without the story. So far I have unlocked Ric Flair by winning the Europeon title and with every title you get you unlock another wreslter. (Rhyno if you win the Hardcore title, Vince McMahon win you win the Intercontinental, Chris Benoit when you win the heavyweight title, Stacey Kiebler when you win the light heavywieght, and Raven when you win the tag titles I belive but I could be wrong). However once you have unlocked the six wrestlers Path of the Champion gets old unless you want to change you title holders as they change in the WWE. There is no Women's championship because there's only about half a dozen women on the game so they must compete for the light heavyweight title. The third and maybe the best mode reliezes the idea introduced in WWF Warzone, being a virtual Vince McMahon. The Battle for the Belts has 51 different title belts each on one of the game's four different difficulty levels (easy, normal, hard, and painful,which is plenty painful). You can win these titles then change the strap color in one player but this mode shines in multiplayer since you can have unifaction matches, defend your belt against a friend, or just see who has the best create-a-wrestler. It like running your own promotion. The Create-Wrestler is the fourth mode and is no where near as detailed as it could and should of been, but it is user friendly, which is good. The game doesn't include Billy and Chuck (but who cares), Maven, Steven Richards, and the recently returned Heart Break Kid but you will find it very easy to create these missing competitors (if you really want Billy and Chuck on your game). The first thing I did on the game was to create HBK which can be done quickly and easily if you wanted to create him. The game also allows you to load off both memory cards (if you have two) like in other Nintendo wrestling games which means you can create a total of 32 wrestlers to add on to the 42 other wrestlers to get a total of 74 wrestlers. This is by far the best wrestling game on the Gamecube but it is not the best wrestling game period. It does some things better the the Smackdown series and No Mercy but not everything which is why this game may dissapoint some people. But the bottomline is that if you want a fun wrestling game to add to your Gamecube collection then you might want to check out WWE Wrestlemania X8.

Forget all other opinions this game ROCKS!!! not only you got awesome graphics with cool details (did you see the Big Show and the detail on his tiger tatoo?) and amazing sound (The Game!!! by Motorhead) but also you get amazing and easy playability (a thing you wont get with the lousy Aklaim wrestling titles!!!) You can choose wrestlers like The Rock, Stone Cold, Hollywood Hogan, Triple H, The Big Show, Rob Van Dam, Chris Jericho, Kurt Angle, Edge and a lot more. This game is an improvement above the good N64 THQ titles like &quot;No Mercy&quot; and &quot;Wrestlemania&quot; thanks to the Gamecube capabilities. The create a wrestler option is a little bit complicated but you can learn it very fast. There aren't as many moves to choose as with &quot;No Mercy&quot; but still you will get an amazing game. If you are a wrestling fan you won't be dissapointed.

I'll go ahead and agree with parents and all others who are concerned with this game, but just for a second.  It contains extreme violence, strong language, alchohol use, and strong sexuual references.  This is the "big thing" really said about this game, but it's really more than that.  Through all the carnage, swearing, and drinking there is a really great storyline accompanied by wonderful gameplay that never gets old, not even in 2004.  And I said the storyline was accompanied by gameplay, not the other way around, because this storyline goes so deep into the most random places, yet, when you think about it it all fits together.  Towards the end of the game things begin to get a little more dramatic, focusing on war and crime, although they are displayed comicly, they still teach a lesson.  Another great thing this game has going for it is all of the film parodies including The Terminator, Alien, The Exorcist, The Godfather, The Matrix, Saving Private Ryan, and some others.  The most memorable would have to be "The Assault" that replicated D-Day from Saving Private Ryan, although fought with Squirls and evil Tedy Bears.  The Matrix takes second place.  Fighting weasel guards as a squirl.  Putting past the story really lets the gameplay shine, which has the widest varity of any N64 game I've played.  It ranges from hitting people or animals with a frying pan, driving a tank, riding a dinosaur, fighting large scale battles, and much more.  The storyline takes you from bee hives, to farms, to war torn fortresses.  The best thing is that it doesn't get old, ever.  Once you beat the final level and see the ending cutscene you finally realize how great a game it was, and you'll want to play it again.
I'll go ahead and agree with parents and all others who are concerned with this game, but just for a second.  It contains extreme violence, strong language, alchohol use, and strong sexuual references.  This is the "big thing" really said about this game, but it's really more than that.  Through all the carnage, swearing, and drinking there is a really great storyline accompanied by wonderful gameplay that never gets old, not even in 2004.

The game starts off pretty ordinarily - people are getting kidnapped, sidekicks introduce themselves. You may start yawning at the start, thinking it's just Starfox Adventures Part 2. But there is much more of a purpose to everything you do in this and you actually start to care about the characters. The world is thankfully compact yet full of things to do. You will need to solve puzzles (some quite clever) but the solution is never too hard to work out. This game includes ideas that have been seen elsewhere but does it with humour, style at a great sense of atmosphere. In some ways, it reminded me of the Monkey Island series, with the old town on an island full of characters. You could imagine pirates rather than robots roaming around. Ubisoft are a French company and the town has a distinct Gallic look to it. It's very well drawn and a welcoming place to go if you want a bit of time out from the adventure. You can play games in the bar, for instance.The voice acting is great - I particularly like the announcer on the races (that are a bit like Star Wars Episode 1.) A sizeable section of the game is taken up with stealth sections. Now, I'm not a stealth fan generally but Beyond Good and Evil manages to make it very fun without losing the tense atmosphere necessary. The guards are both very threatening, wearing spotlights, heavy armour and with the power to command a hovering guncraft to shoot you or to send lasers in your general area. And, yet, when you manage to overpower them, they stumble around bewildered in a comical way. I don't want to spoil things but there are some very funny ways of finishing off the guards.The sound is great, ranging from dark and moody to Jamaican and a bit of French pop/hip hop.The graphics were specially designed (the 'JADE' engine) and the same engine was used on Prince of Persia. It's difficult to tell it was because both games are distinctly different.Jade appropriately wears a lot of green, has green lipstick and green features as a recurring colour throughout. The main characters have been really well drawn. You almost forget that Jade isn't real- she's like a young French film star and her expression can change from wryly amused to fearful within a second.One part of the game is particularly cinematic- a chase across the rooftops. It's like a throwback to a Hitchcock film like North by North West and, though short, it's really well done. The designers obviously had aspirations to make this game film-like and they have succeeded. The scenes at the lighthouse towards the end are beautiful.One of the few disppointing parts was the last level. Not only is it small but it performs the unforgivable error of having un-necessarily long corridors and a virtual absence of puzzles- an otherwise entertaining game pretty much fizzles out amid a cliched alien enivronment.Also- and Zelda is the worst offender though it is also seen in this game and Starfox Adventures- why does a game that is based upon the traditional fairytales of good versus evil and swordfights and magic resort to something as stupid as making the character levitate upwards on certain warp points? This idea is pure Star Trek awfulness that is at odds with the simple core of adventure that these stories should be trying to convey. Even Prince of Persia does it.

In this game the universe is Mario's playground and each planet in each galaxy is its own super jungle gym. All of the cute characters and happy sights & sounds are back. Mario Galaxy is well worth the money because the game is enormous and each galaxy is like a small game in and of itself. It seems that each planet offers a new lesson in physics. On one planet Mario learns to swim. On another he learns to ride on the back of water creatures. On other planets he learns to buzz around like a bee, fling himself from weird sticky rubbery things, swing on a trapeze-like contraption, kick melons at enemies, use creatures as springboards, use giant flowers as hang gliders, ice skate, and much much more. If you like past Mario games you will marvel at the massive creative energy that bursts forth from your television as you play this game!
If you can find my review of Zelda; Oracle of the Ages...you will find more of my experiences.The game is great.  I am not.  I am going to have to go to the Cheats you can find Online and figure out how to get anywhere in this game.  Not their fault.  The Game Boy Advance little compacts are the most beautifully designed pocket games ever made.  Their charge lasts a long time, and the entire unit lasts and lasts.  These little Warioland 4 and Zelda, and Castlevania cartridges are a joy to own.  If you still  have one, hang on to it.  You can still buy a charging unit for not too much $ and too many kids let their parents talk them into trading them for the next new thing.  The parents (too bad) did not apparently play them.  The children were too young to know their value.  I started playing Mario Pinball and Warioland 4 when I was 73.  At  75, besides being an active harpist and trumpet player in community bands....I still play these games.  They are exquisitely created and a joy to have!nancy morse

Oh gee, the game is so funny I thought I got strep throat laugh-ing. This game is funny...the one with a short red squirrel and a tall gray one leaning against the letters Conker's Bad Fur Day, and say "Oh,god, that looks like a friggin' little kids' game!" Well it's notthe game is very funny with adult themes of violence language, and sexual humor.The beginning and ending are slow, especially when you're Conker at the beginning, drunk and hungover.The multiplayer is fun and filled with war games, race and heist.Here are some movies it makes gun of:Jurassuc Park--kind of, you ride around on a raptor and fightmidgit cavemen and you have to bite the tarp off a big one andbite his [rear]---sick?Gladiator--kind of, you use the raptor against the giant caveman in a Roman-style arena.Fast and Furious--not really, there is a part where you're racing cavemen on jet boards.Saving Private Ryan--Really, or the beginning D-Day part at least.The Matrix--really, really, they show Conker and his girlfriendrobbing a bank.Pros:Good, vivid graphicsFunniest game for N64Adorable charactersCons:Horrible beginning and ending.It'll certainitly fustrate you at times.Not for anyone under 17...

This game boy comes with a built in lightwith a light switch,well thats good news,but The Game Boy Advance SP is a lott smaller then the standard Game Boy Advance and can fold up like a tinylaptop computer when not being played.And it doesnt use any standard batteries,the Game Boy Advance SP needs to charge like a regular cell phone with an AC adapter.A Lithium ion battery is built in and cannot be removed or replaced.Nintendo claims that with 3 hours of charging equals 10 hours of play or 18 if you dont use the light.but the AC adapter can be used as a regular power source so you can play the Game Boy  Advance SP can be played while plugged into the wall. The Game Boy Advance SP will have the standard D-pad ,A and B buttons plus START and SELECT.The L and R buttons are smaller and are placed behind the flip top screen.A new Front Light Screen (FLS) button has been added just under the display that functions as the off/on switch for the light.A new sliding volume switch is located on the right side. Games will be inserted from the bottum of the unit instead of from the top like the regular Game Boy Advance and the original. In addition the Game Boy Advance games,the Game Boy Advance SP will also support old and new Game Boy and Game Boy Color games.The games with the built in sensors like Kirby's Tilt'N'Tumble may not work  properly with this unit  because  the cartridge would be flipped upside down during play. The new Game Boy Advance SP screen is the same exact size as the regular Game Boy Advance screen. The Game Boy Advance SP will come with a AC adapter and headphone adapter. The headphone adapter will be required for any regular headphone set since the Game Boy Advance SP doesnt have a mini-plug input.In fact the headphone adapter uses the  same port as the AC adapter ,so using headphones while the unit is  plugged into the AC adapter would be impossible. Another concern is that Nintendo is still struggling  to come up with with a solution for consumers if their internal Lithium ion battery  dies from overuse. Three colors are offered in Japan:cobalt,platinum,and black.But in the U.S. only two colors are offered:cobalt and platinum.In the U.S. the Game Boy Advance SP will be available ... on March 23one day before the release of the game The Legend of Zelda:The Wind Waker for the Gamecube.THANK YOU FOR READING MY REVIEW ON THE GAME BOY ADVANCE SP..............

The Game Boy Advance SP is the latest new hardware from Nintendo. This portable gaming system has the exact same inside parts as the original GBA, it is simply redesigned to fit the GBA SP's more compact shape. This reincarnation of the Game Boy was developed to help Nintendo capture the audience of older gamers and also to better compete with the new cell phones that have games on them. The letters "SP" in the name stand for "special."The GBA SP is noticeably smaller than its predecessor. It is just over 3x3 inches wide, and about 1 inch thick. It is made up of two hinged panels, with the top part being the screen and the bottom part being the standard buttons (the design is similiar to a laptop computer--only smaller). The LCD screen part does not hinge or snap shut, but it is sturdy and does not shake or move when you are playing. The LCD screen is the same size as the original GBA's. The cartridge goes in on the bottom part of the front of the unit. The L and R buttons are still there, but smaller and are located on the back edge behind the other buttons.The GBA SP comes in the colors platinum and cobalt (metallic blue).The GBA SP is compatible with almost all existing Game Boy games (including GB Pocket, GB Color, GBA, etc.). Unfortunately, because of the way the game cartridge is inserted upside-down, tilt-sensor games, such as Kirby's Tilt-n-Tumble, will not function properly on the GBA SP. However, rumble games, such as Pokemon Pinball, do indeed work.Also, all existing accessories will work for this product, including the Card-e reader, the Gamecube link cable, and AC adapters. Instead of two AA batteries, the system uses its own built in lithium-ion battery which Nintendo claims will last 18 hours (10 hours with the light on).Yes, that's right! The GBA SP has a light on it, which may be the best reason to upgrade. The LCD part of the unit is lighted, allowing you to finally play in low or no light! The screen is lit evenly from all sides, making it look even better than a GBA with an Afterburner installed. The light turns on and off with a button above the controls.The specs are the same as the GBA, but in case you don't know them, here are the basic ones:-32-bit processor w/embedded memory-display approx. 41x61 mm-resolution 240x160 pixels-over 32,000 colors displayed simulaneouslyIn conclusion, I would highly recommend this product, especially if you do not own a Game Boy Advance. This product is targeted at new older-aged gamers, but even if you own a GBA, the [money] might not be a big price to pay for the cool new design, smaller size, and lighted screen.

Gameboy Advance SP solves the problems that the original Gameboy Advance had.  Namely, it provides a backlight that makes the system usable in any lighting conditions.  The older version, while a technological marvel when it came to the handheld gaming platform was hampered by the lack of a backlight, the dark shadings of most of its games, and the truly atrocious external lighting accessories that could be purchased for the system.  The SP version's backlight eliminates those problems while also improving on the rest of the system.  The SP is more compact than the original advance, making it more portable.  It also has a foldover design that enables the screen to be protected when not in use, thereby avoiding the scratches the original system was susceptible to.  Finally, the system, itself, requires no batteries.  It's power source is internal and only requires a charging after about 12 of continous play.The only drawback in this system is the lack of a jack for earphones, but that is a minor, minor flaw.  This system can still play every Gameboy game every created (back to the original 15-year old system) and has a wealth of tremdenous titles at its disposal (like the Metroid series and numerous older games that get ported for the handheld platform).  Don't be put off by the SP's 3 1/2 star average rating.  Many of the negative reviewers are people who dislike Nintendo in general.  Objectively, the quality of the SP is tremendous and the titles at its disposal are incredible.

Gameboy Advance lovers are in for a wonderful treat. The new Gameboy Advance SP is truly a blessing. The console itself is even more portable than before when folded closed in its clamshell design and looks slick when opened for playing, like a PDA or a mini-laptop. The console is much more comfortable to hold and the control pad and A/B buttons are much easier to access than on the original Gameboy Advance. The screen is about the same size as the original GBA. The L &amp; R shoulder buttons are smaller and not as easy to reach, especially if you have slightly larger hands, but are acceptable considering the SP's most popular feature.The backlight is truly the best. Most of my playing is at night and I am euphoric over finally being able to play without holding the console under a lamp or the glaring ceiling light. The SP also comes with a fantastic AC adapter; the prior GBA's adapter was sold separately, and looks similar, except the new included adapter plugs effortlessly in the unit and also recharges the lithium-ion battery. The documentation doesn't stress that you can use the AC adapter to also power the unit, but you can, according to Nintendo. They also stated that whenever the lithium-ion battery needs replacement, Nintendo sells them for a small price and is user replaceable. The replacement cost is minimal compared to how many batteries you would buy to replace on the prior GBA console.Games on the SP are much more enjoyable to play and the controls are more responsive. The sound is somewhat louder, but a slightly audible hiss is present, though this is not too distracting. The placement of the speaker is a bit inconvenient; it's easy to move a thumb over it and muffle the sound, but this too is minor. E-reader users will find a slight problem; the E-reader plugged in the SP sticks out towards you in a somewhat ungainly fashion and the socket that normally plugged in the GBA's link cable port is a bit close to the SP's Select button making it only a little awkward to press. This too, is minor, considering how fantastic the GBA SP is. It is too bad that the SP wasn't made first, its sturdiness, wonderful design and the much needed backlight puts us that much closer to portable gaming perfection.

Can't complain about the price since I bought the original Gameboy over 10 years ago for close to the same amount.Pros:Small dimensions...you can fit it anywhere (pocket, purse, etc.)Very light weightFolding design protects the screen from scratches/damageAble to revive/play my original Gameboy gamesRechargable battery lets you save money on buying batteriesRechargable battery actually lasts quite a whileGiven a light on/off option to save batteriesLots of really useful accessories in the market--best one I purchased is the AC/DC/Car AdapterLights indicate &quot;fully charged&quot; and &quot;low battery&quot;PERFECT for traveling!Cons:Didn't come with a gamePorts in the rear are unprotected (uncovered)A little too smooth design...makes it slipperyGames are expensive (typical...3-4 games = game console)Headphone jack should have been a given (Why the adapter?)Original adapter should have been dual voltage (after all, the GBA is designed for travelling, isn't it?)Wishful thinking:Protective rubber around it for shock-proofing and better gripAdjustable light levels

If you bought this item, then you know what it is for. It connects the Nintendo Gameboy Advance to the Nintendo GameCube. Some games have content you can access with this link and some games can only be played using this setup.I haven't used it on many titles but here are some I have. Pac man VS- required to play. Need at least 2 players but can play up to 4. Zelda: 4 swords. You can't play multiplayer without this.There is only one thing that can be confusing. There is a separate item that can play all the Gameboy Advance games on the GameCube. That is the Gameboy player accessory. It attaches to the bottom of the console and will allow you to play any Gameboy Advance game on the TV but you must use the Gameboy Advance as the controller.It will also work on the Nintendo Wii since it has the GameCube controller ports on the console.Here is a list of GameCube games that can utilize this Cable.All-Star Baseball 2004Amazing IslandAnimal CrossingBatman: Rise of Sin TzuBilly Hatcher and the Giant EggCrash Bandicoot: The Wrath of CortexCrash Nitro KartDakar 2Disney Sports FootballDisney Sports SoccerDisney's Magical Mirror Starring Mickey MouseFIFA Football 2004Final Fantasy Crystal ChroniclesFire Emblem: Path of RadianceHarry Potter and the Chamber of SecretsHarry Potter and the Prisoner of AzkabanHarry Potter: Quidditch World CupHarvest Moon: A Wonderful LifeHarvest Moon: Another Wonderful LifeHot Wheels Velocity XJames Bond 007: Everything or NothingKururin Squash!The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords AdventuresThe Legend of Zelda: The Wind WakerThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the KingMadden NFL 2003Madden NFL 2004Mario Golf: Toadstool TourMario Kart Double Dash!!

This game is AWSOME! If you have never heard of the fire emblem games this is how it goes. You collect different team mates as you go through &quot;chapters&quot; (levels in the game). you then control them though these amazing areas. You then have an objective either defeating a boss, beating the intire enemy army, or claiming a throne this game is always fun yet challenging. Anywho the story plot. It is divded into 3 stories. Lyns story is first. Lyn is a sacre girl who is really related to the marquess (mayor) of a kingdom of lycia (ive frogot the name of the kingdom sorry) and she must beat her uncle before he can take the throne. Eliwoods story. He is on a quest to find his father adn descovers his father is caught up in the gang known as &quot;black fang&quot;. He must then stop a dictator that curently controls black fang. or at least thats how i interpreted it. anywho you must stop his plans of bringing the dragons back. im not gonna tell anymore or it might ruin the storyline for you. but this is an amazing game. ive played and beaten it so i should know. there are currently 7 games in the series. (1 for famicom,japans nes system, 4 for super famicom , super nintendo japan, and 1 for japan game boy advance adn this one. the game is great i would get it as soon as you can so you can expeirence the wonder of this amazing game.

Mickey's Speedway USA is a good game. Mickey's Speedway USA is hard as hell trying to win 1st Place. Even though, on some of the tracks, the curves is too sharp which it make the tracks more confusing. And I always keeping bumping into the walls and fall off the road into the waters for example like Hawaii and Oregon tracks. It take the skills and a lot of practice to get really good at the game. I think the best character to use is Dewey or Louie.

Mickeys Speedway USA on N64 is 10x better than Mario Kart 64. It has better gameplay and tracks which makes it more fun. Sure it is Mickey and it is geared toward youger audiences but when it came out I was 18 and still bought it because I make my gaming decisions on gameplay. I miss this game and if I get a N64 this is in my top 5 list.

Great game. I'm not going to describe how good it is because I'm certain there are better reviews out there. Some of you in the smash community is probably wondering what version this is. It's DOL - 02. I bought this game as a replacement for my first version which was Dol- 01.

Over the yrs, handheld ports of MK games have ranged from absolutely abysmal to merely embarrassing(AHEM...MK Advance), so DA deserves special mention for even displaying a level of competence. The sound is great with good vioce samples and surprisingly potent smacking sounds, and the tight conrols retain an impressive amount of 12 characters maoves, stances, and fatalities. And just like it's console bretheren, there's tons of stuff to unlock, even if it's mostly character palete swaps. The most unfortunate thing about GBA DA is the decision to ape the console version's 3D gameplay when it really wasn't neccessary,the arenas are blocky Mode-7 messes that do impossible Escher things whenever the floor meets the background, and the characters have been pixelated to make the "scale". 10 for ambition, at any rate, great game Capcom, keep up the good work.

WrestleManie X8 lacks a lot of the fun features that Smackdown 3 had. It's nice to able have a bunch of special matches when you get tired of Story Mode in Smackdown 3. Here Path to the Championship is torture, have to go through way to many matches to get a title shot. At lease Story Mode is some-what fun the first few times play it and at least you can defend the belt when you win it. Here you can only defend or go for a belt  in a title vs title match  against a friend who won a belt that you need on his memory card. Also just like in Smackdown 3 I find it silly that there's ladder matches but that there's no point in actually winning one if you're not gonna gain a belt in the process. What I like though is that this is the only wrestling game I can think of where you can not only stop a move from happening but stop a finishing move from happening. Plus you can actually reverse moves as well even if that is sort of hard.The wrestling roster is good even if it's missing a lot of wrestlers such as X-Pac, Eddy Guerrero, Billy & Chuck, Billy Kidman, Goldust and Tommy Dreamer. Plus I find it silly that Shane and Stephanie are even on it when they weren't around at all when this game was released. Stacy Keibler being a hidden wrestler is silly too. If their was gonna be a hidden women on the game it should of been one that can at least wrestle like Jazz. There's a lot of wrestlers missing their real ring music as well. Plus the man Hollywood should be able to be used in Red and yellow but that's not an option unfortunetly. A lot of the people on this site called Wrestling Mania X8 the best wrestling game ever before it even came out. That's hardly the case at all but this game is still very playable even if it doesn't add up to much.

Nothing special, It does just what a gamecube controller supposes to do, cuz it's the offical one. no prob here.

Yes, there are NES games in Animal Crossing, but don't waste your time looking for them. They are the hardest things to find. Besides, there's so much else to do. Animal Crossing is about getting a life, meeting friends, making money, finding/collecting stuff, and participating in special events. You can fish, catch bugs, and donate fossils to the museum after you have sent them to Faraway to be analyzed. You can pick your gender but not your ethnicity. At least you can get a tan on the [insert name here] Island. Yes, there is an island, but you need a Game Boy Advance and a GBA-to-GC linking cable to go there. Using the Game Boy Player won't work.Vibrations? Yes. When you hit a solid object with an ax or shovel, your controller (if working properly and set to rumble) will shake. There is no vibration when you get stung by bees, but that probably would have been overdoing it anyway.Your neighbors range from Dogs to cats to goats to frogs and so on. Their personalities range from sweet and outgoing to snobbish and sometimes 100% pure unadulterated evil.If you ever get find them, the NES games include - but are not limited to - Donkey Kong Jr, Clu Clu Land, Tennis, Balloon Fight, and the ever-elusive Punch-Out!!  You can get Soccer by first going to [...] and filling out a form, then saying the code you recieve from the website to Nook.So what separates this game from The Sims series besides the animals? Well, for one thing, you only have control of one character per game. Up to four characters can be created and controlled alternately. How it's done: Save &amp; Quit as one character, then start again as another. See? Not the quick switch in The Sims where you are responsible for everyone, but hey, at least you don't have to scrub the toilets your friends and relatives utterly messed up.I would say more, but this is a review, not a complete description. I have the game and recommend it to anyone (female, male, any and all ages) who love to play games but need a break from hard-hitting action video games . . . and Dead Or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball. Sorry, that other game is only available on X-Box.PS. To anyone who already played the game and is looking at reviews for research or any other purpose: yes, I am angered by the lack of diverse skin-color for the human characters in the game. Sure, there is diversity among the animals, but what non-human is going to play this game? Oh yeah, those trained chimps and gorrillas you keep hearing about but never find.

Whenever there's a whirlwind of hype around something I get really nervous that it won't be able to live up to it. Thankfully, Conker BFD not only lives up to the hype, but goes further by forging new ground in videogaming.  By now you've no doubt been unable to escape all the talk of the crass, potty mouthed humor through out the game and have no fear, it's all true. I won't go into all the gory details, but suffice it to say that you don't want to play this when little Billy or anyone with a weak stomach is in the room. The game is laugh out loud funny and more than once I found myself playing with a huge grin plastered on my face. But what I find even more incredible are the game mechanics.Graphically and sonically the game surpasses anything seen on the N64 before. Colors are bright, edges are sharp and defined and Rare's work on lip synching is incredible. All the characters have expressive faces and fluid movements. Conker will even make a grimace as he passes characters he's angry at! I was also impressed with the amount of cut scenes in the game. Upon entering each new area you'll see a comical scene to explain the objective. In addition, while playing you'll hit some points and a scene starts, but there's no break or cut away, it's just like playing a movie. The jazz-like music through out the game is crystal clear and presented in surround sound to boot! It's hard to belive it's all coming off a cartridge. This is one game soundtrack that I'll be playing loud. If it's ever relesed on CD I'm sure it will be playing on many many CD players across the country.As impressive as these things are, it wouldn't matter much if gmeplay wasn't there to pull you in to experience it all. Thankfully this isn't a problem for BFD. This isn't a typical platformer where all you do is collect items and bash baddies. Rare has desigend the game to be more puzzle based. When you do find yourself hunting for items it's to assist another character and finding it generates an advance in the games plot. Every quest is expertly linked to a the next, so eventhough you need to achieve somehting in one place to further in another you're free to go off and try something else if you get stumped. And that's another thing, progress in the game really flows. Nothing was sooo hard to figure out that I was pulling out my hair. With a little thought and pateince, this is a game can beat without a cheat book. How's that for a change of pace? Without a doubt the best innovation are the context sensitive buttons scattered about the game. when you step onto one or enter a context sensitive area a lightbulb appears above Conkers head and a you hear ping. This is your cue that something special will happen here if you hit the &quot;B&quot; button. Doing this allows Conker to weild flamethrowers, chainsaws, take pills and even turn into an anvil! It's a great idea that gives Conker many items to use and become that you'd otherwise have to hut for in a standard game.Last word, if you are over 17 and have an N64 you must own this game! It's one of the best games available on any system and is sure to set new standards in game design and humor. This is a MUST buy guys!

It appears that the evil Space Pirates are up to their devious ways once again, only this time something has gone horribly wrong. Samus was called in to investigate and she arrives on the scene to find a disabled Space Pirate ship floating above the planet Tallon IV. With little to go on, Samus must venture forth and attempt to get to the bottom of things. Her adventure begins as she enters a mysterious derelict spaceship. Traverse a crippled spaceship and explore the vast worlds of Tallon IV in an all-new first-person perspective! Take advantage of Samus's many powers using new suits that enable her to gain new abilities and revisit earlier worlds to uncover many hidden secrets. Master Samus's combat, scan, and visors -- elements crucial to your success. Explore each area to find many familiar weapons, such as the Wave Beam and Freeze Beam, and some all-new ones as well. Choose the right weapon or ability carefully for the situation at hand. Samus will need to use all of the suit and visor abilities as well as many specialized weapons to navigate deadly Tallon IV.

Samus came to destroy half of the remaning Space Pirates from the original 2D game Metroid, she loses most of her abilities in an crash in a pirate frigate early in the game, she must collect all of her missing arsanal of weapon, suit, and visior ,over the course of the game, from the far corners of Tallon 4's climate(Tallon overworld, Phazon mines, Magoorn caverns, Chozo ruins, and Phindendra drifts), hunt the space pirates ,as well as their leader Ridly, and recover the sacred Chozo artifactes to get in the Phazon crater to see what made the Chozo bird-like people to go away and turned the animals into monsters.

This is the 3rd installment to the metroid series. And probally one of the best. It was the first of the metroid games to have a map of the areas and a section that told what you have collected so far. It takes place after samus aran finishes off the metroids on the planet SR388 which is roughly about oh maybe 6 months-1 year after the origional metroid. Ridley, a massive teridacle like creature (also from the origional metroid) goes to the space coloney (a massive research station used by the intergalactic federation police) to take the baby metroid which latches itself to samus in metroid 2. after samus lays some damage on ridley it takes off with the metroid and selfdestructs the coloney. samus then escapes and follows the flying feind to the space pirates own base....the origional home of samus aran! (i found that out reading some metroid manga, japanese comics) the game is outstanding. if you have a super nintendo you have to get this game. but if you dont have patience and cant exept a defeat here and there you will probally smash this game in a mad rage. but this game is the best with some seeings of some old enimes such as ridley, kraid, and the mother brain. and some new ones such as draygon, crocomire, and phantoon. this game is amazing the name is super metroid, the platform is super nintendo, and the fun level is infinity!

You quitly step out of your spaceship onto the sandy, damp ground of an unexplored planet. Suddenly, a giant flash of lightning appears as it starts to rain heavily. You nervously look behind you. Nothing there. In a hurry to get away from the rain, you run under a near cave. After going through an old, broken door another lighting flashes and an intemidating roar of thunder follows. You slowly continue to walk through the abondoned, lifeless cave. A slight glisting of metal appears as you approach a peice of torn machinary. Traveling depper, you find the entrence to an old advanced shelter of somekind. After exploring somemore, you return to this enterence spot. A flash of lighting lights up the place again and you find a giant insect mantis like creature staring right at you. In a hurry you fire your beam at it and destroy it. An ear-wrentching cry echoes the halls as you see there are tons more of them, crawling on the walls jumping down from the ceilings, surrounding you. In a hurry, you attack them one by one and run to the cave enterence of the place. Suddenly, it lights up with life. Giant crab like insects start crawling down the walls, trilobites flee as the abondoned bunker becomes housed again, lights flicker on and off and motion is constantly seen throught this once desolate and quiet place. Only not one human or freindly creature is moving. Thats basically the opening sequence of Super Metroid. Constantly through this game will be intense and sometimes freighting moments of suspence. There is also always very satisfying action to follow. You play as Samus Aran, who has really cool sumersaulting jumping techniques. Also, she can shoot something right at a pin of a target while sumersaulting through the air ten yards away. Shes a really cool character with a really cool suit and a really cool arsenal of firepower to go with it all. Plus, a really cool game. Most of the game will be taken up exploring places, finding new abilitys/weapons in those places, and using those abilitys to gain acces to and explore other places. Most of these enviroments are dark, suspensefull, and gloomy like the one described above. The game also features some inovative enemys that can be destroyed challengly and satisfyingly no matter how you fight them. It has some really great graphics, too. But, the one con, and its a big one to, is that after watching the opening cutscenes, theres almost no story left. You'll alot of times be wondering if youre supposed to be in an area or not supposed to be there, with no real knowlege of where to go or what to do next. Just little hints like you've accomplished a big task in an area and feel that the next big task is in another big area. Other than that, this game is a really great classic and should be played by all at least once. It really almost plays identically to Metroid: Fusion, so a learning curve would be very small since alot of people have probably played fusion by now.

Before he was convicted of sexual assault, before he beat his wife half to death, and before he bit Evander Hollyfield's ear, Mike Tyson signed a deal with Nintendo to make a video game that pits a wiery-looking teenager nick-named Little Mac against (in order of appearance) Glass Joe, Von Kaiser, Piston Honda, Don Flaminco, The Hippo King, Great Tiger, Bald Bull, Piston Honda again, Soda Popinski, Don Flaminco again, Bald Bull again, Mr. Sandman, Super Macho Man, then eventually Mike Tyson. The bad news: You're not Mike Tyson, you're Little Mac. Fortunately, you have a chubby coach in your corner with a never-say-die attitude and a shiny pink bike (who says gay people have no place in video games?).So while the game isn't 2-players and you can't fight as Mike Tyson, it's still one of the best boxing video games you'll ever play.

Oh well where to start. well if you like to knock out boxers from all over the world up-close, using your trusty uppercut and low blows and star punches this for you. go up against boxers like Bald Bull, Piston Honda, Mr. sandman. Super Macho Man,Don Flamico King Hippo who by the way doesn't bother to get up at all after u knock him down the first time lol!i remember back when i was 10 in 1988 playing this with a friends. then i purchased Punch out in 1990 a cheap rip off this  game except for the last boxer who looks like mike tyson except he called mr. Dream. i think maker made that game Punch ou because mike tyson was in trouble with the law in the late 1980's or he had some kind of scandal going on. so they remade the game punch -out.when you finally reached Mike Tyson himself his puches will KO u in the first minute  and a half. then he will blink his eye and throw puches till he first round is over. you may have to and probably will go 3 rounds with him. once your score get past 5000 you can beat him by a split decison. so go on turn on mike tyson's punch out now an Ko him the hell out!peace ..fellow gamers and retro gamers..!!

(Quick Note: The only difference between "Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!" and "Punch-Out!" is that after Iron Mike signed a contract to be in the game, the gap-toothed puncher was convicted of rape and sentenced to hard time. Not wanting that kind of bad press directed at them, Nintendo re-released the game with Tyson being replaced by the crew-cut Mr. Dream, who shares the EXACT same punches and mannerisms as Tyson).Since I was given my first Nintendo Entertainment System in 1991, I have been a devoted brand-loyalist my entire life, playing such systems as the Super Nintendo, Nintendo '64, Gamecube, and the Wii. Through that lineage, I was able to see video games "grow up", in a manner of speaking, what with the introduction of 3-D game play with Mario '64, the explosion of the Madden Football series, and the new motion-sensor interface of the Wii. Yet, through all those great games and innovative ideas, it is still a simple boxing game that charms me every time.I think that the biggest appeal of "Punch-Out!" is its quirkiness. You play as Little Mac, a scrawny little fighter who must take on other pugilists both man and animal alike! There's Don Flamenco and his corny dances, Magic Tiger with his spinning knockout punch, and Bald Bull with his "Bull Charge". Plus, fighters like Piston Honda (obviously the Asian representative), Soda Popinski (a knock-off from the arcade game's Vodka Drunkenski, which Nintendo tamed down a bit), and Mr. Sandman are also quite colorful and interesting. With a cast of characters like that (including more that I'm not even mentioning here), how could the game not be engaging, as players wait breathlessly to see which oddball will come out of the woodwork next!Of course, the challenge of the game is also what keeps players coming back for more. At first, you will hardly be able to defeat "Glass Joe", a wimpy fighter who is little more than a punching bag. However, as you begin to learn the basic controls, you will be able to advance to the next fighter, who always has something else up his sleeve. Each fighter also has their own individual "tells" (Piston Honda's eyebrows, various sound cues, etc.), which (once studied) can give you an edge in defeating them. If you have not played this game, I cannot put into words the joyful feeling of, having toiled to defeat a particular fighter time and time again, you finally put him on the mat for good!About the only criticism I have of "Punch-Out!" is that, right at the very end, the difficulty level rises into the stratosphere. From Glass Joe to Super Macho Man and all fighters in between, they can be beaten by any decent gamer who puts in some time and effort. For Tyson/Dream, however, your reflexes need to be honed to nearly those of a cat in order to defeat him. However, that "weakness" also makes the game enjoyable after being defeated for the umpteenth time, as no matter how good you think you are, Tyson/Dream will give you the video game challenge of a lifetime.So, I would highly recommend this game to ANY video game enthusiast out there (not just boxing fans). In today's world of complicated games that often have side-quests that can seemingly last forever, it is refreshing to find a game that is so simple and straightforward, yet challenging and engaging. Plus, if you are nostalgic for the NES whatsoever, this game will slip back into your gaming identity much like a boxing glove slips onto Little Mac's determined hands.

However, that "weakness" also makes the game enjoyable after being defeated for the umpteenth time, as no matter how good you think you are, Tyson/Dream will give you the video game challenge of a lifetime.So, I would highly recommend this game to ANY video game enthusiast out there (not just boxing fans).  In today's world of complicated games that often have side-quests that can seemingly last forever, it is refreshing to find a game that is so simple and straightforward, yet challenging and engaging.  Plus, if you are nostalgic for the NES whatsoever, this game will slip back into your gaming identity much like a boxing glove slips onto Little Mac's determined hands.

I am 16 years old and have been a fan of Wallace and Gromit for a long time. When I saw this game for sale a couple of years ago, I felt like I had to have it, so I got it, and I don't have any regrets.The game is an interactive sequel to Nick Park's award-winning short film, 'Wallace and Gromit in The Wrong Trousers.' In this game, you take on the role of Gromit, Wallace's faithful sidekick, in an attempt to foil the evil Feathers McGraw's plan to take over the zoo and make diamonds. As Gromit, you'll move from one challenging level to the next, rescuing baby animals that Feathers has imprisioned and collecting tools and other items to build a bunch of wacky devices needed to advance in the game. And the game includes a bunch of extra features, including a clip on how the game was made, clips from 'The Wrong Trousers,' and 'The Snoozeatron,' the latest installment in the Cracking Contraption series.The game's graphics are really a thing to see. While they don't look very realistic, they look almost exactly like they do in the original claymation. I think that any Wallace and Gromit fan should add this game to their collection of Wallace and Gromit merchandise.

By now, many people have reported how their Bravely Default CE was shipped to them poorly and ended up arriving damaged if you ordered directly from Amazon. If you ordered yours' from Amazon, you have my sympathies, as I can imagine the pain you'd be in seeing such a lovely package delivered in such a unfortunate way. Thankfully, I pre-ordered mine from Best Buy, who packaged mine very well. That been said, I thought I'd try my hand at actually reviewing this package as a Collector's Edition specifically, as many reviews on the page here are about the game only, OR they're just about the Amazon shipping debacle. So, how does this rate as a CE specifically?- The Game. Obviously, this is the biggest draw of the overall package. I already posted a detailed review ofBravely Default as a game on the standard edition's pageand I don't want to go into such detail here. For this particular review, I'll just sum the game up thusly: Bravely Default is an exceptionally designed, impressively refined JRPG that evokes tons of nostalgia for Squaresoft's era of PS1 JRPG masterpieces. ThinkChrono Cross,Xenogears, and especiallyFinal Fantasy IX, and you've got a good idea of what to expect. The game adds its own interesting twists to the traditional JRPG formula, which makes BD feel like a fresh, modern take on a classic genre. The hand drawn graphics are jaw-droppingly gorgeous, with a style that combines watercolor paintings and old-timey children's fairy tails. The visuals light up your imagination and immediately suck you into the game's world. The soundtrack is nothing short of brilliant (more on that later). The story itself is not necessarily the most innovative for the genre, but it is told exceptionally well. It moves at a mostly fantastic pace and is full of charming, likable characters that are developed really well. Bravely Default may have some nit-picky aspects here and there, but for the most part, it's a masterfully executed game, and any fan of the classic JRPGs of yore who has a 3DS owes it to themselves to pick this game up. It has the kind of intangible magic and refinement that the Final Fantasy series hasbeen sadly lacking for several years. BD is a wonderful game, plain and simple. So that's the game, a solid 8.5-9/10, and as the main attraction to buying this CE, it's a big incentive. So how's the rest of the CE, you may wonder?- The box. The package the CE comes in is very well designed. It's the size of a large book and opens up like one. On the cover is a classy silverish image of one of the game's main characters, and the back features lush screenshots of the game and its art. Lovely. Once opened, there are several compartments where the rest of the CE's treasures comfortably sit. It's a fantastic presentation. I totally understand why so many were upset when they found theirs mangled by poor packaging, as the box is gorgeous when intact.- The AR cards. One of the more unique and unusual features of Bravely Default is its use of AR cards. Not many games have used this feature at all really, let alone well, but BD has integrated it in unique ways. To that end, this CE has a tiny box no bigger than a standard card deck would come in, filled with 34 AR cards. Each card features a lovely portrait of one of the many characters from the game, whether primary and secondary. The art on these cards is very nice, and the printing is fairly  high quality. Even if you never used these as AR cards, they are still pretty nice as collector quality items in my opinion.- The soundtrack. As I said earlier, the soundtrack in BD is incredible. If you told me that the music in this game was some long-lost collaboration betweenYasunori MitsudaandNobuo Uematsu, I'd believe you. Seriously, the music in BD has the beautiful melodies characteristic of Mitsuda's music, and the elegant sophistication of Uematsu's work. I also hearJoe Hisaishiin it as well. There's even a bit of kick-@$$ rock thrown in the mix at times. Seriously, what an amazing soundtrack. To get a CD featuring ten songs from it, lasting 35:42 in total, is quite the treat. Really, my only complaint about this part of the package is that it's only a fraction of the great music that went into the game, but that just serves to compliment the soundtrack itself more than anything; it really is that good. Revo, the composer for the game, did a superb job. In my opinion, the mini album is worth the extra ten bucks for the CE by itself.- The art book. What a treat this is. I really can't emphasize how beautiful of a game BD is, and that really is all thanks to the gorgeous art design behind it. The hand drawn style really lends itself wonderfully to the game, and that becomes apparent thumbing through the art book included in the CE. It is roughly as long as the CE's box is tall, and a little shorter than the width of the box, if that makes sense. It's a decent sized book, coming in at a little over 60 pages of jaw-dropping, splendid art. There's a really good variety too, with concept AND promotional art for many characters, locales, and scenarios. Almost all of the character design was done by Akihiko Yoshida, famous for his work on games likeFinal Fantasy Tactics,Vagrant Story, many of the recent FF DS remakes, etc. There's also lots of space featuring the spectacular locales from the game. It's great. The printing quality is really done too, for the most part. Sadly, there's one page in my copy that is marred by a very small printing defect. Other than that, the art book is excellent. Much like the music CD, I think it'd be worth getting the CE for the art book alone.- The price. Ordinarily, I don't stop to talk about pricing, but I feel compelled to with this one. This CE is $50. The standard edition of the game is $40. That's a mere ten dollars for a neat pack of 32 AR cards that can be enjoyed as collector's items OR as AR cards used in the game, a musical CD featuring over 35 minutes of incredibly awesome music, and a gorgeous little book featuring tons of art from one of the 3DS' most visually beautiful games. Again... Only. Ten. Dollars. More. Wow. I would've been happy to spend 60-70 for this CE, but to get it for a mere $50 almost feels like I'm getting away with robbery. I personally think it's a great value. If you can still find one for that price, buy it immediately.So there you have it. Pretty much everything about this CE package screams 5-stars to me. I know a lot of people complain that we didn't get the statue of Agnes like other regions did, but when you consider the price tag and the amazing things we do get, I still think this is a top-quality package. They just don't make games like these that often anymore, sadly. They don't go all-out for collector's editions like this anymore either. Bravely Default is such a lovely game on its own, worthy of pretty much every 3DS owner's attention. If you are a fan of the legendary Squaresoft of yore like I am and yearn to experience some of that good ol' magic, then I heartily recommend this CE. Just make sure you're careful that whoever you order it from packages it with the care such a great CE deserves. Hope you found this review helpful. Thanks for reading. Toodles.

I too have played and enjoyed the MCF games for the PC. When I received the notification from Amazon, I ordered it immediately. Since I'm 56 and the old eyes are not as sharp as they were, I was a little worried that the screen would be too small to give a "true" MCF experience.No worries though. The picture size is fine. The graphics are excellent and there are even ambiant sounds like fountains creeks, cuckoo clock, fireplace crackling and creaking floorboards.There are also new tools (underwater googles, xray...)you earn as you progress.Since I have played all the MCFs for PC, I went straight to the Detective Level where each section is timed. If you don't finish in time allotted, you repeat that section until you get it completed. Even that is still a challenge, because the list of items changes each time you attempt it. Because of the constant changing of hidden objects you can play through the game several times.I believe that this game would be fun for all ages and I would not hesitate to recommend this game. I feel it is hands down one of the very best games for the Nintendo DS!!!
I don't know about you, but I have sure missed the kind of PlayStation JRPGs, and specifically the Final Fantasy games, that Squaresoft published in the 90's. The many classics from that era had an intangible magic that is fairly rare in the industry these days. Thankfully, Bravely Default is a lovely gem that could easily be mistaken for some long-lost Squaresoft gem from that period, and playing it reminds me of the way it feels playingFinal Fantasy IXandXenogears. This is a special treat. Warning: somewhat long review incoming, either buckle up, or jump ship now if that's not your thing. Having become intimately acquainted with the eshop demo, as well as putting it quite a few hours into the main game by now, I feel confident in my ability to give an informative, honest assessment.The story in Bravely Default features four protagonists, all of which have backstories that any veteran of the genre would regard as painfully cliche at first glance. You get Tiz Arrior, a young man recently beset by horrible tragedy and great loss. He is joined by Anges Oblige, a sheltered priestess girl who must save the world by healing huge crystals through prayer, Ringabel, an amnesiac ladies man with a magical book, and finally Edea Lee, a spy for an enemy nation who joins the heroes at a later point (try to guess why she does this. Here's a hint, it's cliche, lol). Of course, political intrigue, giant elemental crystals, and world saving shenanigans ensue. It almost sounds like a "Four protagonists walk into a JRPG" bar joke, doesn't it? Thankfully, what Bravely Default's story lacks in innovation, it more than makes up for in execution. The writing in this game is, for the most part, very well done. The story is mostly coherent and moves along at a good pace with memorable events that make sense. The characters are all generally likable and developed well. Plenty of endearing humor offers a nice counterweight to the serious moments. There's a nice balance between freedom and structure, so you never feel strangled by linearity or lost with no guidance. Overall, Bravely Default is a very charming, well-written JRPG adventure. All of this is more than I can say for anyFinal Fantasy from the last several years(sadly), so Bravely Default gets a big thumbs up from me in its plot and story structure. It's very enjoyable to take in. It's a definite throwback to the classics of yesteryear and makes for a good adventure.To aid in the sense of adventure of the story are the visuals, all of which are influenced by hand drawn art, water color paintings, and old-timey children's fairy tale books. It's very unique, full of imagination, and quite beautiful. The visual designs of the settings in this game are nothing short of brilliant. Wondering around the various locales, all of which are quite unique, really reminded me of how I felt playing Final Fantasy IX for the first time. Amazing. The 3-D effect does even more to add dynamic impact to the visuals too. It's no stretch to say the awesome settings add a lot to the game's story. Akihiko Yoshida, known for his work designing characters in games likeVagrant Story,Final Fantasy Tactics, and the recentFinal Fantasy DS remakes, did the character designs in this game. To be honest, this aspect will probably be a love-or-hate thing for people. His stylized art tends to be. While some characters are kind of silly looking and clumsy (more on that later), I personally like the character design for the most part. All-in-all, Bravely Default is an undeniably gorgeous 3DS game.Let's talk about sound for a moment, and specifically the soundtrack. Let me put it this way... If you told me that the soundtrack in this game was some long-lost collaboration betweenYasunori MitsudaandNobuo Uematsufrom the 90's, I'd probably believe you. Seriously, Bravely Default's soundtrack is amazing. It has the striking emotive melodies characteristic of Mitsuda's music, and the lovely sophistication and elegant refinement of Uetmatsu's work. Every song fits its purpose perfectly for every situation/scenario/circumstance. Indeed, "Revo" nailed the soundtrack in this game. Other than that, most of the sound effects in the game are appropriately nostalgic. There's a surprisingly large amount of voice acting in the game, and thankfully most of the time it falls between acceptable and exceptional (keywords there being "most of the time").As a JRPG, Bravely Default works very well mechanically. All of the basics in the game are very well refined and play as well as any classic Final Fantasy game would. However, there are a couple twists in place that make this more than just an adequate FF clone. For one, the battle system features an "action point" system wherein each action, be it attack, use an item, etc. costs you 1 "Brave Point." In "Brave Mode," you can go all out up to a deficit of 3 BP, meaning you can attack an enemy four times in a single turn if you want. Beware though, because if still standing, the enemies get to wail on you for four turns in a row.  Then there's "Default Mode," which is basically a turtle-up move that allows you to accumulate BP for later use, while greatly increasing your defense for that turn's duration. This system has a fantastic feeling of risk vs. reward that encourages and prizes smart strategy, and I appreciate that.The other unique aspect in this game is its robust job system. Anyone who has playedFinal Fantasy Vwill know what I'm talking about. Each distinct "job" or class has different stats and abilities and most (but not all) fall under archetypal roles (ie. White/Black/Red/Time Mage, Monk, Thief, Ninja, Knight, Swordmaster, etc), and you can change any character's class on the fly under most circumstances. There's a huge number of team combos you can achieve with this that not only allows for deeper strategy, but guarantees that every player can have a unique experience catered to their tastes. It's really great fun. Usually, I find bare-bones turn-based RPGs to grow rather boring shortly. Thankfully, the job system and Bravely Default combat modes makes this a very engaging RPG. Throw in unique streetpass features and an incredibly large amount of options that makes the game experience tailored to virtually any player, and you get a cocktail of smart design choices. All of this makes Bravely Default a unique, deeply refined JRPG that makes the experience stand out among its source inspirations.For the sake of being fair and all that, let's talk about some criticisms for the game. Like I said earlier, the character style will be a love-hate thing. Since the job system changes character outfits, the only constant distinguishing feature of the main characters is their face and their hair. Unfortunately, two of the main characters, Ringabel and Edea, have hair styles that look stupidly ridiculous, even for an anime character, which is a shame. Again, I usually really enjoy Yoshida's work, and it's *mostly* great here, but some designs fall short. Also, some "job" outfits look ludicrous in certain cutscenes. Try imagining a serious scene playing out while Ringabel is wearing the Las Vegas Elvis suit (complete with aviator shades) that the Performer job has, or the fox-mask wearing Ranger... You can't do it without laughing. Kind of ruins the serious vibe in those scenes. The pre-rendered cutscenes, while having stunning detail, feature characters with a bizarre, somewhat unappealing combination of chibi and realistic proportions and details that I'm not a huge fan of. It's a little off-putting if you ask me. The mechanics of the game are awesome except for one admittedly small thing that still really sticks in my craw. There's a special sleep ability you can use to make battles much easier. You replenish your supply by putting the 3DS is sleep mode for eight hours (pain), OR, pay REAL money in a micro-transaction. Now, to be fair, the game is balanced so you don't *need* it, but still... Call me old fashioned, but if I pay this much for a game, I expect every feature to be included, no strings attached. Micro-transactions in a game like this is just plain ugly in my opinion, and glaringly so in a game meant to salute past classics.  You stay classy Square Enix. This sort of stuff is why people these days call you an evil/incompetent out-of-touch corporation. None of these issues are "game breakers" per se, some are admittedly very nit picky (except for the microtransaction aspect), but they are worth mentioning for the sake of fairness.Bravely Default is, by and large, a great 3DS game, despite some nit-picks here and there. If I could be more specific, I'd rate this game somewhere between an 8.5-9 out of 10. In many ways, this game is a wonderful salute to the kinds of JRPGs Square made for the PS1 back in the day. In fact, I'd say that Bravely Default is to PS1 JRPG masterpieces whatRadiant Historiais to SNES JRPG masterpieces: a nostalgic homage while still offering enough new ideas to feel like a genuinely unique and fresh JRPG for the modern age. All things considered, I'd highly recommend Bravely Default to the majority of RPG fan/3DS owners who, like me, miss the kind of quality JRPG releases of yesteryear. Buy it, gather up your trusty four protagonists, and prepare to save yet another world in a new (but not final, sequel already confirmed) fantasy.
When I first tryed this game I was expecting it to be alot better, but i still found it pretty good. The graphics are very good. The few reasons why one star is that Personaaly i don't like the story. And the other reason is that you die pretty easily unles you have things called cyber elves to get it higher....

I simply loved the first Golden Sun, but this game was phenonomal! If you played the first game you pretty much know what's going to happen in this game, but WHO CARES! The main idea throuhout the game is that Felix and his gang (Felix, Jenna, Sheba, and Piers) are attempting to light the Jupiter and Mars Lighthouses and restore Alchemy to the world. Gain new psynergies, fight intimidating bosses, and team up with Issac and company and light the remaining lighthouses!

I loved Golden Sun, so I was very excited about playing this sequel.  At first, I was disappointed because you are no longer the character in the first game.  In fact, you won't hook up with Isaac and the gang until way into this game.  You are now Felix, the kid who was swept away in a stream back in Vale and who seemingly joined the darkside but, since you are now taking control of his character, he must not have been so bad after all.  So, instead of starting out with Isaac, Garet, Ivan, and Mia with their level 31 powers, you need to start all over again with a new posse of characters.  I guess this makes sense as you do not need to complete the GS1 to play Lost Age.  The first team will have all the powers you gained for them in the first game, but they won't be needed too much.  Djinn Flash and Granite and some of Ivan's psynergy will pretty much be the only pivotal things they bring to the group.There are several things different about Lost Age than GS1.  First, I found that I used attack Djinn much more often in battles.  I almost never used psynergy to fight.  Psynergy was almost exclusively used for performing tasks and solving puzzles.  You get a lot of new psynergy like Tremor, Scoop, Pound, Sand, Cyclone, Hover, Blaze, Burst, Teleport, and Parch.I also noticed that I hardly bought any weapons, armor, or healing items.  Most of the stuff I used I found (including the ultra powerful Sol Blade), earned in battle, or won at the Contigo slots.  Consequently, you can amass a ton of coins (coins were much more precious when I played GS1).  One of the most useful purchases will be Mist Potions in Prox near the end of the game in preparation for your final showdown, and money will be no object by then.  I had almost 415,000 coins before my final boss battle, over double what I had in GS1.Another difference about this game is you'll be able to travel by ship to different continents.  This ship will also have wings built on it so you can fly over certain barriers (alas, not all barriers).You get a better idea what's going on here, too.  It seems that, because the lighthouses are not lit, there is no longer enough elemental energy to grow and sustain the world.  A map reveals that the continents of the world are shrinking.  The beacons of the four lighthouses thus must be lit (Venus will be lit at the beginning of the game).  Isaac and the gang did not know this in GS1.A lot of things I loved about GS1 are in Lost Age.  There are many different places to see and things to do.  There is also excellent music that changes with almost every place you go.  The melancholy music in Garoh fits the tale of the lycanthropes who take the form of werewolves because they borrow powers from beasts and are, therefore, often considered beasts is a beautiful combination.  I kept that part saved on my game for a long time.  You can also save the game anytime, except during battles, which is an incredibly useful feature.Another similarity to GS1 is that, in LA, the toughest battle is not the last.  It is the Star Magician on Treasure Island.  I would not tackle it right away.  I would wait until you find the powerful Sol Blade in the Mars Lighthouse on the other side of the world and backtrack to Treasure Island.  The Star Magician is aided by four balls (or spheres, if you will).  You need to defeat his strongest spheres in the following order of priority: 1. Guardian Spheres, 2. Refresh Sphere, 3. Anger Spheres.  Only after the magician has 4 Thunder Spheres do you attack him.  Unlike other boss battles, you do not use summons.  Set all your Djinni, and attack with Felix's Sol Blade.  Sheba and Piers should alternate Flash and Granite.  I tried Shade instead of Granite but it did not work.  Shade allows a little more damage which is just enough to prevent me from keeping my guys alive.  Jenna should either be using Flower or healing psynergy.  She should also have some Mist Potions and Waters of Life just in case (maybe divide them up between Felix and Jenna).  This strategy will take a long time--maybe 45 minutes--but it will work eventually.  If it goes right, you won't even need to use Isaac's team.  It took me many tries to beat this dude.  Incidentally, you do not need to defeat the magician to beat the game, but why not go for it?!  This strategy will also work in the final boss, the Doom Dragon.Another difficult part was a room full of Hover pads in the Jupiter Lighthouse.  You have to stay above the Hover pads to keep hovering but a whirlwind will force you onto some broken tiles and, if you're there too long (which seems like just a nanosecond), you'll fall through the floor and have to start all over again.  After many tries and many swear words, I discovered that if you leave the hover pads and return to them at a angle, you'll shave off just enough time to make it.  I did this twice, to the right to activate one of the statues to the lighthouse, and to the left to pick up the Phaeton Blade, which was the most powerful weapon I had found up to that point.  As it turns out, the Phaeton Blade is not that powerful compared to other weapons you will get and I ended up selling it so you really only need to conquer the Hover pads once on the right side of the room and save yourself the frustration of having to do it twice.The end of the game was neat but I was a little disappointed because I was looking forward to returning to Vale (the first town in GS1).  Seeing that town again with that old music would be a real treat.  As it turns out, that will be impossible.  Oh well, I'm more nostalgic than most.  I definitely recommend beating GS1 before playing Lost Age, although it is not necessary.  I think you will love this game so much you'll want to play both, so you might as well play them in order.  As always, get a walkthrough!  Good luck, adept.

The melancholy music in Garoh fits the tale of the lycanthropes who take the form of werewolves because they borrow powers from beasts and are, therefore, often considered beasts is a beautiful combination.  I kept that part saved on my game for a long time.  You can also save the game anytime, except during battles, which is an incredibly useful feature.Another similarity to GS1 is that, in LA, the toughest battle is not the last.  It is the Star Magician on Treasure Island.  I would not tackle it right away.  I would wait until you find the powerful Sol Blade in the Mars Lighthouse on the other side of the world and backtrack to Treasure Island.  The Star Magician is aided by four balls (or spheres, if you will).  You need to defeat his strongest spheres in the following order of priority: 1. Guardian Spheres, 2. Refresh Sphere, 3. Anger Spheres.  Only after the magician has 4 Thunder Spheres do you attack him.  Unlike other boss battles, you do not use summons.  Set all your Djinni, and attack with Felix's Sol Blade.  Sheba and Piers should alternate Flash and Granite.  I tried Shade instead of Granite but it did not work.  Shade allows a little more damage which is just enough to prevent me from keeping my guys alive.  Jenna should either be using Flower or healing psynergy.  She should also have some Mist Potions and Waters of Life just in case (maybe divide them up between Felix and Jenna).  This strategy will take a long time--maybe 45 minutes--but it will work eventually.  If it goes right, you won't even need to use Isaac's team.  It took me many tries to beat this dude.  Incidentally, you do not need to defeat the magician to beat the game, but why not go for it?!  This strategy will also work in the final boss, the Doom Dragon.Another difficult part was a room full of Hover pads in the Jupiter Lighthouse.  You have to stay above the Hover pads to keep hovering but a whirlwind will force you onto some broken tiles and, if you're there too long (which seems like just a nanosecond), you'll fall through the floor and have to start all over again.  After many tries and many swear words, I discovered that if you leave the hover pads and return to them at a angle, you'll shave off just enough time to make it.  I did this twice, to the right to activate one of the statues to the lighthouse, and to the left to pick up the Phaeton Blade, which was the most powerful weapon I had found up to that point.  As it turns out, the Phaeton Blade is not that powerful compared to other weapons you will get and I ended up selling it so you really only need to conquer the Hover pads once on the right side of the room and save yourself the frustration of having to do it twice.The end of the game was neat but I was a little disappointed because I was looking forward to returning to Vale (the first town in GS1).  Seeing that town again with that old music would be a real treat.  As it turns out, that will be impossible.  Oh well, I'm more nostalgic than most.  I definitely recommend beating GS1 before playing Lost Age, although it is not necessary.  I think you will love this game so much you'll want to play both, so you might as well play them in order.  As always, get a walkthrough!  Good luck, adept.
This is a great Mega Man game because you get a nice Mega Man story at the beginning. You must stop Mr.X who has taken over the robot tournament. Plus in this game you merge with rush to form Jet Mega Man and Power Mega Man

I have been a Mega Man fanatic since 1991.  When I started playing the NES series, I was instantly hooked.  Each sequel became much better after the first.  Mega Man 6 is my third favorite title (Mega Man 3 is first, and Mega Man 5 is second.).  It even has some of the best soundtracks -- my personal favorites??  Blizzard Man, Centaur Man, and most notably Tomahawk Man.  However, some of the bosses are much harder than in previous series.  The boss battle music isn't too bad, and I especially loved the intro music to when you have to beat all 4 levels of Mr. X (who is really Dr. Wily in disguise).  Although it was great to see Dr. Wily finally get his comeuppance by going to jail, it didn't last.  He would later break out of prison in Mega Man 7 (the graphics are not so great on the Super NES, by the way).This particular series is waaay fun but much too easy; however, the Capcom designers more than made up for that with the Mega Man X, Mega Man Battle Network, and Mega Man Zero series.  One thing is for sure, no matter how many Mega Man titles are created, it STILL isn't enough!  :)  That is how great the entire series is, so what are you waiting for?  Download this game post-haste!!

The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages can be a sequel or a beggining to The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons. In this game Nayru, a sorceress, (you may know her from Zelda: The Ocarina of Time) has been kidnapped by an evil sorceress named Veran. Veran has traveled back in time and you must stop her. In order to go back in time, you need the Harp of Ages. You get some help from some animals, Dimitri the Dodongo, Moosh the winged polar bear, and Ricky the boxing kangaroo.

This is one of the best games!  You have to play it.  It is definitely the best game in the Zelda series so far.  It has adventure, romance, mystery, and SO many subquests.  It's about a boy named Link who has a destiny.  He lives in Kokiri Village, a little tiny village in the land of Hyrule.  Anyway, a little fairy named Navi comes and says that he must meet the Deku Tree.  He does and the Deku Tree tells him to go inside the Deku Tree and destroy all of the evil monsters inside him.  Link does this and the Deku Tree gives him the Kokiri Emerald, or the Spiritual Stone of Forest.  The Deku Tree phrophesies that Ganondorf, an evil desert Gerudo man, is trying to get hold of the Triforce, the essence of life in Hyrule.  But in order to get hold of the Triforce you have to get three of the spiritual stones.  Unfortuantely, after the tree's prophecy, he died because of the curse Ganondorf had cast upon him.  But Link and Navi go on their journey and get the Goron's Ruby, or Spiritual Stone of Fire and the Zora's Sapphire, or Spiritual Stone of Water.  Link gets the Ocarina of Time but when he opens the doors Ganondorf gets in before him and he gets the Triforce.  Link waits seven years in the Chamber of Time and when he awakes he's all grown up.  Rauru, the Sage of Light is there and tells him that he must save all the Sages from their temples and receive the medallions.  He receives the Medallion of Light, Forest, Fire, Water, Shadow, and Spirit.  But the game.  It's definitely one of the best N64 games around!
Ok I am continuing my reviews for The Zelda games I own cause I don't own every Zelda game. This Zelda game is without a doubt favorite Legend Of Zelda A Link To The Past Which for any of those who don't know was suppose to be called Zelda III The Triforce Saga. But since The NES was near the end of it's life span Nintendo decided to go for The SNES. If any game deserves the title of Zelda III cause I think of the 1st 2 Zelda games on The NES & A Link To The Past as a Triforce Saga. Now after Zelda II wasn't what everybody wanted even though I didn't mind it they decided to go back to an overhead view & drop The RPG elements go back to using Rupee's & weapons instead of using all magic attacks. If I could give this game all the stars in the world I would if I am a fanboy for this game then color me a fanboy. I played this game a lot along with Mario All Stars & Street Fighter II Turbo back in the day. Even now hearing about all the glitches & preforming them this game is feels fresh & this game is 21 years old. This game brings a lot to the table like the tone which would be used in Ocarina Of Time & big time in Majora's Mask as well for Twilight Princess. This game started the dark tone in a Zelda games. You have this character Aghnim he not only collects the money from The King for helping him he then kills The King & takes these Maidens that are ancestors to The Wise Men he seals them into The Dark World. The Dark World is the land where The Triforce is at people who go to The Dark World don't come back & they change shape. It's a twisted version of Hyrule. Link is framed by Aghnim a kid gets sick from the evil air coming from Death Mountain. You have this kid who plays the flute who is dead. The next reviews I do for The Zelda games will go more in depth this game was released in Japan in 1991 & a few months later in The Spring of 92 The name of this game in Japan is The Legend Of Zelda The Triforce Of The Gods. The story is Ganon tries to get his hands on The Triforce he enters The Golden Land The King has 7 Wise Men put a seal on the enterance to The Golden Land which it seems that he's been sealed there forever. Hundreds of years later a drought a famine & illnesses have spread through Hyrule The King thought it had something to do with The Golden Land but the seal was intact a Wizard or a Satanic Priest however you want to look at I prefer what Aghnim was in The Japanese version. Aghnim shows up & ends the problems with Hyrule, The King was looking for decendents of The 7 Wise Men Aghnim helped him find them then he got a big role in The Kingdom Aghnim's intentions came clear he murdered The King Of Hyrule put a mind control spell on The Guards had The Maidens rounded up & sent them to The Dark World which this is all told in the opening & it really showed off the power of The SNES plus that music by Koji Kondo is great which ALTTP is my favorite Zelda score Ocarina Of Time is 2nd the opening music where it shows Aghnim sending The Madiens to The Dark World scared me as a kid.[...]Princess Zelda is locked up she sends out a telepathic message 1 of the people who get it is Link & this is not The same Link from the 1st 2 games & this is not the Zelda you save from the 1st game or the sleeping Zelda from part II. Link's Uncle decides he's going to see what that Aghnim guy is up to he tells Link not to leave the house. Well he does anyway you head for The Castle & find a secret passageway where you find your Uncle has been badly injured he gives you his sword & shield he never finish'e his sentence & there is a lot of debate about what he wants to say he says Princess Zelda is your a lot people say he is going to say your Sister. Link might have a connection to The Royal Family cause in the novel his father was a knight but Zelda being his sister I doubt it. So the 1st thing you have to do is save Zelda & get her to this Church so she can be hid. You have to find 3 Pendants that will allow you to get The Master Sword this game introduces The Master Sword. You'll have a few side quests to get items you need to get to each dungeon or will help you complete it The Light World Dungeon music is another track that scared me as a kid[...]Also Aghnim has framed you for kidnapping Princess Zelda when you get The Master Sword Guards have taken Zelda killed The Priest so you have to head into the area of the castle where you weren't allowed to enter before cause The Master Sword can break the seal. Aghnim makes you watch as he sends Zelda to The Dark World. When you face Aghnim you can't fight him head on you have to play Dead Man's Volley as it's called. When he's beat Aghnim draws you into The Dark World & if you have The Moon Peral from The Tower Of Hera then you won't change shape into a bunny. Going back can be a hassle. This man you meet before the 1st Light World Dungeon Sahasrahla contacts you telepathically & that you have to free all The Maidens & Zelda & that is the only way defeating Aghnim & Ganon. The Dark World has no human's everyone has been turned into a beast or some kind of animal that represents what's in their mind & heart. It might be best to try to upgrade your weapons whenever you can like you shield & you can upgrade The Master Sword when you save this Blacksmith who is trapped in The Dark World. You can get a powerful Golden Sword near the end. The Boomerange can be powered up to reach further when you keep throwing in rupee's to summon a Great Fairy. I like how you can increase the number of arrows & bombs you can carry. The Silver Arrow's return too mainly to defeat Ganon. Other items you need is like from The Desert Temple The Power Glove that allows you to pick up heavy rocks. In the 4th dark world dungeon you get The Titan's Mitt that let's you pick up even heavier rocks & stones. I mentioned you must get The Moon Peral from The Tower Of Hera cause it allows you to keep your human form in The Dark World. Another must have item to even get to the 2nd temple is The Pegasus Boots that Sahasrahla. that let's you move faster & you have to use them to knock The Book Of Madora off a book shelf in Kakariko Village which that book is the only way you can enter The Desert Temple. The 3 Medallions you get are very handy. The items you get in The Dark World such as the hammer in the 1st Dark World dungeon The Hookshot in the 2nd Dark World Dungeon. The Fire Rod in The Forest Temple in The Dark World. The Titan's Mitt mentioned about already in the 4th Dark World dungeon. Then in the 5th Dark World dungeon you get The Blue Mail that reduces the amount of damage you take. The 6th Dark World dungeon contains The Cane Of Somaria that create these blocks that can weigh switches down it can also get create a block that can get you to the other side of the room like in Turtle Rock. Also in Turtle Rock you get The Mirror Shield. In Ganon's Tower you obtain The Red Mail which reduces the amount of damage you take even more. Basically you need all the items to complete the game such as The Ice Rod, Zora Flippers, The Magic Cape, Cane Byrna. There are a couple of side quests that stand out in my mind like the 1 where you get the flute there is this old man & his grandson is missing there is this boy that looks similar to Link & anytime you approach him he disappears it's cause he's dead. In The Dark World you find this animal or whatever it is standing on a tree stump you find out that is Flute Boy cause he went to The Dark World & was killed. With this flute you now have access to a bird that will fly you place to place & this lost old man in the caves leading to Death Mountain & he gives you the mirror that can take you back to The Light World. This game is 1 of the 1st times I believe that Nintendo allowed death in their games. So the game started a dark tone in Zelda games. I mentioned the glitches & how they made this game feels fresh I tried them out there kind of funny like you can face Aghnim while you have Zelda with you & Aghnim is sending Zelda to The Dark World it's like you got Zelda out of her cell so who is Ganon sending to The Dark World. Plus you know it's night time when you start the game & it's raining well if you do the glitch where you beat the game in like 5 minutes then in the ending it's night time & it's still raining. My favorite glitch is where you have the mirror & The Moon Peral ok & you can keep going back & forth from The Light World to The Dark World near the broken bridge & you can explore The Dark World before you even face Aghnim the 1st time. Just make sure you have the mirror, The Moon Peral & The Master Sword. Stuff you have to figure out like how to get The Big Key or the item in each dungeon is great. The bosses were all good The Ball & Chain Trooper who is in the castle. To The Armos Knights which a lot of fun. The boss of The Desert Temple Twinmola it's a good pattern type boss. The Tower Of Hera Moldorm is annoying cause if it knocks you off the ledge then you got to fight the boss all over again. The 1st Aghnim fight is good cause you have to knock it's attacks back at him. The Dark World dungeon bosses are well done some are harder than others such as Arrghus, Mothela, The Blind Thief & Trinexx. The 1st Dark World dungeon boss isn't too hard Helmasaur King you just use your hammer bust away at the metal on his face & fire arrows at the middle of it's head. In The 2nd Dark World Dungeon you battle Arrghus who is a big eyeball surrounded by several small eyes which you have to use The Hookshot to pull the eyes away & slash away with The Master Sword until you have to fight the giant eye. Mothula in The 3rd Dark World Dungeon while difficult all you need is The Fire Rod to beat it. The Blind Thief is hard cause it has 2 or 3 heads attacking you. In The 5th Dark World dungeon you face Kholdstare which is kind of a pain. You also have to have the bird to get to The 6th Dark World dungeon & the boss is Vitreous who is sort of like Arrghus but not as hard. To get into Turtle Rock you have to have The Quake Medallion & to get through it you have to have The Cane Of Somaria. This dungeon is a big pain cause you have to light torches to open some doors & if 1 torch goes out then the door will close. The boss Trinexx in it's 1st phase where you use The Fire & Ice Rod's isn't hard when you fight in it's 2nd phase then it's more of a challenge & I recommend that you get plenty of red or blue potion or some fairies on hand for The Dark World dungeon bosses. When you beat The 7 Dark World dungeon youu free a Maiden & finally Princess Zelda. Which takes you to Ganon's Tower where you fight the 3 Light World dungeon bosses again & have the 2nd & final encounter with Aghnim. Which the 2nd battle with Agahnim is a little bit harder. The final boss is Ganon & Ganon is the hardest of any Zelda game cause it takes 4 Silver Arrow's this time instead of 1 & when stomps the floor the ends start to break off & if you're knocked off the ledge you have to start the battle all over again. I think A Link To The Past Ganon is harder than Ganon in The NES original or Ocarina Of Time. But when you beat Ganon you are treated to a great ending. I know this has been a long read & I said my next reviews for The Zelda games are going to be really long so just a warning. This game is amazing bottom line while love Ocarina Of Time & enjoyed Majora's Mask & Twilight Princess this still remains my favorite Zelda game. If you never played Legend Of Zelda A Ling To The Past you should & play it any way you can cause you will miss out on 1 of the best games of the 90's

This is technically part one (or two depending on which order you play) of the Zelda Oracle story.  THe idea in this chapter is simple.  AS Link you are summoned by the triforce to take on an evil force in the land.  In this chapter the oracle of Seasons has beened kidnapped by the Dark Knight Onyx to disrupt the balance of nature and destroy the world.  As link you must assist the elder tree and gather the 8 essences of NAture and rescue the oracle.  Although pretty much unarmed at first you must quest to retrieve these essences and save the day.  After this the story continues in Oracle of Ages where you must eventually take out the true force behind the evil (if you play oracle of ages first than the story goes the other way).What makes this fun though is that the challenge is tremendouse.  A must own for GBC/GBA fans.  Purchase with LoZ Oracle of Ages to get the full story.

Welcome to this, this is another review for The Zelda games that I own & as you can see it's a review for The Legend Of Zelda Majora's Mask. While not as epic as Ocarina Of Time this game does so much right that it does come close. Also forgive me if this review sounds more like walkthrough I said in my Ocarina Of Time review that when you get to 7 years later when Ganondorf takes over I mentioned it has a dark tone. In Majora's Mask it has a dark tone from start to finish. This game came out in the year 2000. The story is takes place I don't know how long after Ocarina of Time when Link was sent back to live out his childhood he lost from Ganondorf Link is out looking for Navi who left him at the end of OOT. Skull Kid who I didn't mind in Ocarina Of Time in this game I hate him I know he's under Majora's influence but he still stole the mask from The Happy Mask Salesman which lead to all the evil things going on. You start off with Link who is blindsided by 2 fairy's Tatl & Teal who are Skull Kid's fairy's. Skull Kid steals The Ocarina Of Time which Princess Zelda gave him he steals Link's Horse Epona he turns Link into a Deku Scrub Sapling. Which the little Deku Scrub Sapling contains the spirit of Deku Scrub Child. Tatl gets gets left behind Teal is all alone with Skull Kid you follow the path that Skull Kid took & you meet up with the only character besides Link from Ocarina Of Time The Happy Mask Salesman. He asks for your help to get Majora's Mask from The Skull Kid cause he tells how that mask contains pure evil & he can help you return to normal if you get your ocarina back. You head into this place called Termina you have only 3 days to complete what you need to do & you'll see why cause there is a giant angry looking moon in the sky & it's going to blow Termina off the face of The Earth so yeah there people in town worried about it some want to leave others want to stay cause they think nothing will happen. There is an event that's going to happen called The Carnival Of Time in 3 days. So you have some exploring to do like you need to help The Great Fairy cause she has been broken apart by Skull Kid & you have to find The Stray Fairy to put her back together where she will give the ability to fire bubbles. Now the guards in Clock Town will not allow to leave cause your a Deku Scrub Sapling all of about 4 or 5 years old your not properly armed & they wonder where your parents are at. In the east side of Clock Town you can get to Termina Field using a glitch. You can also try to join The Bombers Gang a group of kids that like to help people in need. You can go to The Astral Observatory when you learn the code from The Bomber's where you can get a Moon's Tear that you can give to an Adult Deku Scrub & he will give you a land title deed for his flower. You can use that to fly up to The Clock Tower during the last 5 hours of the final day. You can get your ocarina back & play the song of time where it takes you back to the start of the 1st day. The Happy Mask Salesman will teach The Song Of Healing that will turn you back to normal & leave a Deku Mask behind that you'll need to use in the 1st dungeon. When Link tells The Happy Mask Salesman that he didn't get Majora's Mask from The Skull  Kid he becomes The Angry Mask Salesman & I can see why people think he's creepy when gives you an angry look. As a human you can now join The Bomber's Gang cause they wouldn't let Deku Scrub Sapling Link join cause Skull Kid was in their group & he didn't work out. You get The Bomber's Notebook. You then have to take on 4 temples in a swamp, in the mountains, in an ocean & in a canyon. You head off to Woodfall where The Deku Royal Family live there's a member of the family missing & that's The Deku Princess The Deku King is mad is going to punish this monkey that was seen leaving The Woodfall Temple. You have to sneak around in your Deku Scrub Sapling form you have to sneak past the guards & get to the area where the monkey is at I do hate the part where you have glide with The Deku Flowers to each platform. You find out The Deku Princess was captured at Woodfall Temple & it is a good starter temple & you get The Bow & Arrow you have a couple of ok sub bosses & a decent boss. For every temple you beat you free 1 of the 4 giants the boss Odolwa provides a pretty good challenge. The bosses weren't as hard as Ocarina Of Time or A Link To The Past or the 1st 2 games. There is 1 boss I don't need a real strategy to beat that I will talk about. You save The Deku Princess after beating The Woodfall Temple take her to The Deku Palace she's mad at her father for punishing the monkey. If you want to do something mean spirited then watch the monkey being dipped boiling hot water it leaves the monkey unresponsive. This game can be emotionally dark. As a Deku Scrub Sapling you can race The Deku Butler & when you catch up to him he tells you that you remind him of his son. At the beginning of the game you find this dead Deku Toddler that was killed at the hands of Skull Kid. I liked The Deku in this game they weren't just standard enemies in this game. The Goron's in this game look the same except for The Goron Elder & his Son which is a baby Goron that won't stop crying cause his Dad's gone. The Lens Of Truth returns you can see Darmai's ghost & you get The Goron Mask obtaining The Lens Of Truth can be a pain. Now Darmani was a sort of leader for The Goron's he was killed in Snowhead trying to figure out they're having a long winter casue they're going to freeze to death if they don't stop it. To get The Transformation Mask you need to have The Song Of Healing & play to free their soul. Which The Goron Mask contains Darmani's soul & when you're wearing it The Goron's all think you're Darmani. The Snowhead Temple is solid cause it has a hard sub boss challenging puzzles & Ghot is 1 of the more interesting bosses in a Zelda game & the funniest of the game. Also in Snowhead Temple you The Fire Arrow enhancement. Side quests are well done I like The Romani Ranch side quest where you help Romani & Cremia. You meet this little girl named Romani who asks your help to kill these ghosts or aliens or whatever they are from stealing their cows. Cause every year around this time "they" as she calls them steal their cows which is their source of income cause their milk goes to Mr Barton & his Milk Bar in Clock Town. Cremia Romani's Older Sister  owns the ranch after her father died. I care about these characters & what happens to them. If you beat Snowhead Temple spring comes to the mountains & you can obtain a powder keg that can blow up the giant boulder blocking Romani Ranch & if you get there on the 1st day you can get Epona back but on the 2nd or 3rd day you can't get Epona back. Cause on the 2nd day Romani will be walking around the ranch a look of confusion & will be unresponsive. On the 2nd night she will be asleep in her bed. Also on the 2nd day Cremaia will be in the barn with a depressed look like she's going to cry she's wondering why she didn't listen to her sister & she's all worried about her. Plus all their cows are gone. At night Cremia is sitting at the dinner table even more depressed & looking like she's near suicide. On the 3rd day Cremia is still in the barn depressed. Romani will be stilling on a box all messed up it's hard to explain I don't know wtf those aliens ghosts or whatever they are did to her cause on the night of the 1st day she was abducted by "them". Anyway this side quest is a must to complete you can just play The Reverse Song Of Time that slows the current of time & give you plenty of time to help Romani & is also useful in temples too & you can get done whatever you need to do in a reasonable amount of time. If you have protected the ranch Romani will give you a bottle with Romani Milk. Bottles are also a must have item you also get another bottle early on in Southern Swamp when you help Koume & Kotake cause in this game they're good. Getting back to Romani Ranch on the 2nd day everything is fine Cremia can now deliver milk to Clock Town it's kind of sad Romani can't go to Clock Town when you know Link & Romani kind of helped save the cows. The Night Of The 2nd day you can help Cremia by defending the wagon against 2 masked men who try to break the milk bottles. If you manage to hold them off then Cremia will give Romani's Mask which allows you to get into The Milk Bar & buy milk including Chateau Romani which gives you unlimited magic for the full 3 day cycle. On the night of the 3rd day Romani & Cremia will be in the barn Romani tells you that she get to drink Chateau Romani it's her 1st time cause Cremia acknowledge's her as an adult. She also tells Romani to sleep with her tonight cause Cremia knows that this will be their last night. Another thing is the people causing all the problems & grief on the ranch is 2pe  do  p  h  i  l  e's named The Gorman Brothers. I mean on the 3rd day if you fail to protect the ranch they incriminate themselves mentioning what happened at Romani Ranch. So I shudder to think what they did to Romani. The 3rd temple is in Great Bay & there are a group of Zora's who are The Terminaian counter part cause Hylians have a Terminaian counter part like Romani is a reused character model of Malon as a little girl & Cremia is a reused character model of an adult Malon. Except for a few original models like The Goron Elder, Darmani & The Goron Elder's Son. The Deku Royal Family is all original too. These Zora are part of a band called The Indigo Go's there is this girl named Lulu who has lost her voice a group of Gerudo's have stolen her eggs. For 1 why do they want The Zora Eggs for breakfast or to use on their missions. You have this Zora out of the ocean & to dry land he was injured & left for dead by The Gerudo Pirates his name is Mikau using The Song Of Healing you can get The Zora Mask & you head off to find the 7 eggs 4 of which are at The Pirates Fortress. These Gerudo's are more prone to kill unlike their Ocarina Of Time counter parts. I also got The Stone Mask early so most enemies can't see you & you'll have no problem getting the eggs If you're able to get all 4 eggs then you take them to The Laboratory. The other 3 eggs are at Pennaicle Rock & with the help of a Sea Horse it will guide you there you'll have to face 3 Deep Sea Pythons. If you get the 3 remaining eggs then you can take them to The Laboratory & you'll learn The Ballad Of The Wind Fish play it Lulu she'll get her voice back & head to The Water Temple. I didn't care for the water temple in Ocarina Of Time I didn't mind it in Majora's Mask it's my least favorite. Gyrog is the worst boss ever in a Zelda game. There no strategy in beating it all you do is shoot it with an arrow turn into a Zora use an electrical barrier on it & I am horrible in Zora form so I just get chewed up by Gyrog & lose health. The other 2 bosses Odwalla atleast you needed a strategy to defeat it & Ghot was interesting  & a fun boss. You get The Ice Arrow's in this temple which you freeze enemies with the sub bosses were pretty good though especially the 1 that was a throwback to A Link To The Past. Oh yeah if you want another mean spirited thing you can do is take Lulu's Eggs & in West Clock Town you can take them & sell them at The Curiousity Shop I did that 1 time & I felt like a real pos for doing it. Next is 1 of the weirdest areas in the game The Ikana Canyon where you also have a side quest in the graveyard where Dampe is at he's not the same Dampe from OOT in The Ikana Graveyard you can get The Captains Hat & you can order around Stalchildren. There is this emotional side quest with this girl named Pamela her Dad has been infected & is cursed & is part Gibdo. You can play The Song Of Healing to turn him back to normal the cut scene afterwards is well done. In Ikana Castle you get The Mirror Shield which looks pretty bad & you learn The Elegy Of Emptiness which leaves statues of yourself if you play it in human form then you have a weird statue of human Link which is nick named Ben because of this story called Ben Drowned which is a story in itself. Stone Tower Temple is a puzzle in itself cause of all the flipping you have to do to the dungeon. You also get another enhancement for your arrows The Light Arrows. The Wizrobes return as a sub boss in this dungeon although they do throw in original sub bosses here & there. The boss is like a throwback to Twinmold from A Link To The Past. If you get The Giants Mask it evens the fight up but you can only use for this boss only. Stone Tower Temple is ok. The sub boss The Garo Master is hard & I have easier time fighting Iron Knuckles. You can go on & face Majora since you have awakened all 4 giants I like to have all the masks so I do 1 of the most attention grabbing side quests The Anju & Kafei side quest that goes the full 3 day cycle. You help Madame Aroma find Kafei who is her Son. Kafei is going to marry this woman named Anju who runs The Stock Pot Inn at 1:50 the 1st day you get a room key & if show her Kafei's Mask then then she'll ask for your help you have to deliver a letter she wrote to Kakei at 3 in the afternoon the 2nd day you meet Kafei he tells you that Skull Kid turned him into a kid & Sakon a real pos stole his Sun Mask cause he & Anju were going to exchange masks the night before The Carnival. On The 3rd day The Curousity Shop Owner has been taking care of Kafei he tells you he's waiting for Sakon at his hideout you have to help Kafei get through the security system where The Sun Mask is on a convayer belt being taken down to where Sakon is at I guess. If you manage to get to it before the mask falls into the hole then Anju & Kafei will reunite on during the final hours then I go on & face Majora. However if you fail Kafei is stuck & I shudder to think what Sakon is going to do to him. Anyway when they reunite it's a really nice cut scene & you'll get The Couples Mask which means you're a witness to it. When you go into The Clock Tower you play The Oath To Order where Majora loses his grip on Skull Kid you then go into The Moon it's very unsettling with the tree & The Moon Children who want masks & you play hide & seek you have to deal with 4 dungeon themed rooms. Each Moon Child wears a mask that represents the boss of that temple. You have to give up all your non transformational masks. If you have all the masks then you'll be able to do that & will get The Fierce Deity Mask it makes the final battle with Majora easy & with that Termina is saved from doom all is right in the world & Link goes back to Hyrule Termina celebrates The Carnival Of Time. This game does so much right from the tone to the characters a pretty good item selection decent dungeons really good side quests decent bosses a with the overall message. So a really good follow up to Ocarina Of Time & if you've not played Ocarina Of Time or Majora's Mask you're missing out on 2 of the best Nintendo 64 games ever.
(Note:This is the Gamecube Collectors Edition version)I remember ten years ago,seeing the commercial for this game.I always did wonder what it was like.After getting the collectors edition I immediately got started on it.The story focuses,as always,on Link.Link is a young boy living in the Kokiri Forest.One night he has a nightmare,and wakes to discover a fairy named Navi,who will help him through his journey.He is overjoyed but then discovers that the gaurdian of Kokiri Forest,the Great Deku Tree,is dying from a curse.The tree passes along a Spiritual Stone and recommends to see Princess Zelda.Link does so and Zelda tells him to get the other two spiritual stones so Link can get the Master Sword to stop Ganon,King of the Gerudos,from entering the Sacred Realm and stealing the Trifoce,a divine relic.Link achieves the other stones and the Ocarina of Time.Link draws the Sword and finds out he has been tricked by Ganon,who entered the Sacred Realm.Link awakens seven years later,and after discovering he is now an adult,meets Rauru the Sage of Light.According to Rauru,the only way to defeat Ganon is to awaken the Five Sages.That is where the true quest begins.Wow,what a story!Now,the graphics are not bad by today's standards.Neither are the dungeons.They are amazing.And also very complicated.(Please don't mention the Water Temple).Overall this game can be summed up by one word:Perfect.Buy the game,become the hero,and have the time of your life.
I am getting this game in good condition. So in the beginning, Link is awakened by a telepathic message from Princess Zelda, who says she is a prisoner in the dungeon of Hyrule Castle and that Agahnim has done something to the other six girls and now Zelda herself remains. Link wakes up to find his Uncle ready for battle and tells Link to wait for him to return by morning and not to leave the house. I just disregard what Link's Uncle says and head to the castle, only to find him gravely wounded and no longer able to go on. He offers his nephew advice and urges him to rescue Princess Zelda, after which he passes out.

Excelente juego. Es muy diferente a cualquier juego de v&iacute;deo. Obliga a pensar y a moverse, dos cosas que en los v&iacute;deo juegos son muy escasas. los gr&aacute;ficos son simples, pero no se necesita mas. la m&uacute;sica es muy adictiva y divertida. Claro esta que uno no aguanta jugar por horas este juego, pero si lo anima a jugar un poco todos los d&iacute;as para seguir avanzando y eso es muy bueno con los ni&ntilde;os que normalmente se quedan pegados a un juego por horas.
Este no es el juego tradicional de mover el control. Este es el juego de mover el cerebro y luego mover el control. Muy sencillo, muy divertido y permite jugar en familia. Tiene muchas opciones y es muy divertido. Mis hijos y yo lo jugamos juntos todo el tiempo y me gusta por que no me aburre y no los aburre a ellos.
Es el juego que m&aacute;s les gust&oacute; a mis hijos de verdad que es sencillo pero muy entretenido. Adem&aacute;s Mario & Luigi hacen la diversi&oacute;n instant&aacute;nea.

An amazing acci&oacute;n adventure game; with beautiful videos telling you the story. Most of the game is like an old 2D world, you can chance to first person view almos any time and you must do sometimes.Un extraordinario juego que regresa mucho a las raices de Metroid, juegas en 2D y muchas veces puedes y otras debes cambiar a perspectiva de primera persona. Videos muy bien hechos que te cuentan la historia, acci&oacute;n y aventura en un gran juego.Lo recomiendo mucho si te gustan los juegos cl&aacute;sicos o de este tipo.
Lleg&oacute; en excelentes condiciones y copleto con ambos CDS! Me encantan los juegos de ZeldaLa &uacute;nica cosa es que tienes q tener el control motion plus para jugar
A compilation of the classic adventures of this pink character, is a great opportunity for new players to play classics  games and for more veterans that we could not play them all at the time. Is a special collector edition version.Una recopilaci&oacute;n de las aventuras cl&aacute;sicas de este rosado personaje, es una gran oportunidad para que los nuevos jugadores conozcan juegos cl&aacute;sicos y para los m&aacute;s veranos que no pudimos jugarlos todos en su momento, Es una versi&oacute;n especial de coleccionista.
Each of this 3 games it's wonderful but all of them on one disc and the price of one is awesome.Todos los Metroid son excelentes juegos, pero tener todos en una edici&oacute;n especial en un solo disco es algo que un fan de la seria Metroid no debe perderse.En adici&oacute;n el nuevo control aporta mucho a la experiencia jugable
It is a good game no doubt, has some innovations, the problem is if you have played the previous ones are not many. It's a new twist to the Mario world of paper.Well check to see if it is your kind of game, I recommend it, but it could not be just what you want if you are not familiar with the type of game that is.Es un buen juego sin duda presenta algunas novedades, el problema es que si has jugado los anteriores no son muchas. Es una nueva vuelta de tuerca al mundo Mario de papel.Revisa bien si es tu tipo de juego, yo lo recomiendo, pero podr&iacute;a no se exactamnete lo que buscas si no est&aacute;s familiarizado con el tipo de juego que es.
Este juego me encanta! El dise&ntilde;o de los personaje me encantan y la historia tambi&eacute;n. Cada calabozo es un reto100% Recomendado

This game is one of those games that you will keep playing until the next line of consoles come out.  This game is hectic one player and even more hectic if you bring friends over.  There is the engine size like in all MK games (50cc, 100cc, 150cc, etc.) the higher the CC the faster you go and the harder the AI is.  after choosing your cc you get to choose your characters and your kart.  You get two characters per kart each charaacter with a special item (baby mario gets chain chomp, DK gets big banana, etc.). after choosing your characters from the list of 16+ you choose your kart.  The karts are sorted by weight class (light, medium, heavy).  your characters determine what weight class you are in, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.  after that you choose between 4 cups (mushroom, flower, star, and special) each with 4 tracks in them.  by getting golds in the cups you unlock new content like extra battle tracks and characters.speaking of battle this is one of the best parts.  get your friends together and blow them up in one of three battle types (shine thief, bob-omb blast, and classic balloon battle).  in shine thief you want to take control of the shine until the timer reaches zero, get the shine by hitting them with shells, banana peel, or whatever else.  in bob-omb blast every question mark block is a bomb and you blow each other up first to 3 or 4 hits wins.  In balloon battle you have three balloons and the last one with any balloons wins.  Knock your friends out by shooting them with shells to make their balloons fly away.All in all i think this game is one of the best on the gamecube and i recomend it to all gamecube owners.

The concept of racing games always grabs the attention of everyone, even those who have never played on a game console. Mario Kart Double Dash (MKDD) not only grabs you, but also hooks you with its ingenous racetracks, colorful and funny karts and their favorite trademark characters.This game is one of the few to take advantage of the broadband adapter (sold separately). The broadband setup allows up to 8 players to play simultaneously using 8 separate TVs and consoles (requires an 8-port hub with patch cables), or 8 players on 2 TVs(4 players per TV) using 2 consoles (requires only a cross over cable to connect the 2 consoles). These kind of setups are fantastic for a LAN party or even a MKDD tournament.Racing in this game is now a cooperative effort, there's the driver and the thrower on the same kart. Characters are classified as light(e.g. Baby Luigi), medium (e.g. Yoshi) or heavy(e.g. Bowser). There are also three (3) corresponding kart types. Any combination of driver/thrower is possible but they can ride only on a kart as big as the heaviest character in the pair. Light karts accelerate fast, but are weak when colliding against heavier karts, and they don't have great top speeds. Heavy karts accelerate slowly, but they are strong and have the highest top speeds. This character/kart combination allows the player to experiment and find the best pair for him/her.The main event is the grand prix competition. In this event you race against human and/or computer opponents trying to reach the goal first not only with speed but by using your wits. Special items such as banana peels or green shells, among others, are scattered all over the tracks for you to pick up. Each item gives you a strategic advantage that if used wisely can make a difference at the end of the race.Apart from the grand prix competition there are also other race modes such as time trials (to measure how fast you finish a track), versus (race against human players only) and battle, which also has its own variations. These game modes combined with multiplayer capabilities makes this game entertaining for a long period.How many character are there to choose? Well, there are 16, but who knows if there is some kind of code to unlock others.How many karts? There are 8, but you unlock others as you start winning grand prix tournaments.If you want clean, fun entertainment for the whole family then this one is a winner.

Heavy karts accelerate slowly, but they are strong and have the highest top speeds. This character/kart combination allows the player to experiment and find the best pair for him/her.The main event is the grand prix competition. In this event you race against human and/or computer opponents trying to reach the goal first not only with speed but by using your wits. Special items such as banana peels or green shells, among others, are scattered all over the tracks for you to pick up. Each item gives you a strategic advantage that if used wisely can make a difference at the end of the race.Apart from the grand prix competition there are also other race modes such as time trials (to measure how fast you finish a track), versus (race against human players only) and battle, which also has its own variations. These game modes combined with multiplayer capabilities makes this game entertaining for a long period.How many character are there to choose? Well, there are 16, but who knows if there is some kind of code to unlock others.How many karts? There are 8, but you unlock others as you start winning grand prix tournaments.If you want clean, fun entertainment for the whole family then this one is a winner.
The concept of racing games always grabs the attention of everyone, even those who have never played on a game console.  Mario Kart Double Dash (MKDD) not only grabs you, but also hooks you with its ingenous racetracks, colorful and funny karts and their favorite trademark characters.This game is one of the few to take advantage of the broadband adapter (sold separately).  The broadband setup allows up to 8 players to play simultaneously using 8 separate TVs and consoles (requires an 8-port hub with patch cables), or 8 players on 2 TVs(4 players per TV) using 2 consoles (requires only a cross over cable to connect the 2 consoles).  These kind of setups are fantastic for a LAN party or even a MKDD tournament.Racing in this game is now a cooperative effort, there's the driver and the thrower on the same kart.  Characters are classified as light(e.g. Baby Luigi), medium (e.g. Yoshi) or heavy(e.g. Bowser). There are also three (3) corresponding kart types.

Ive been playing this game for years by myself and with my friends. It is simply amazing. For single player there are 3 different grand prixs each with 4 wacky courses with 3 levels, 50cc,100cc, and 150cc. Higher the cc the higher the speed. Each level up is harder. Beat levels to unlock the special cup, special karts, and new amazing characters. Each character has its own special like marios flame balls and koopas triple red shells. There are tons of multiplayer options for up to 4 players. Race each other in a grand prix, go one on one or whatever combination in a versus. Or face off 2 on 2. For two players, there is a co-op mode. One person drives, while the other rides shotgun being able to throw items and punch nearby opponents karts. There is also a battle mode for up to 4 players with weird tracks such as tilt-a-kart and pipe plaza. There are 3 battles, Shine theif, bob-omb blast, and balloon battle. All of them are loads of fun, especially bob-omb blast and balloon battle. Unlock another level known as mirror and play each course reverse. Unlock the all-cup-tour and play a 16 race tour following every single race.  Here are my final totals:Fun: 9/10, nothing like throwing items and duking it out to the finishmultiplayer/co-op: 10/10, tons of fun options for up to 4 playerstime: 10/10, hours upon hours of gameplaybugs: nonefeatures: 10/10, several unlockable features and race coursesoverall: 10/10, a legendary game.

I have WL1,3 an 4 but i beat all of them. I played this a long time ago (first WL game i played) at friends house an i wanted a copy but gamestore didnt have copy of game at the time but they had wario land 3 so i got it (wario land 4 and the GBA didnt come out yet) then when gba an WL4 came out i got that but my friend didnt manage to get a GBA but got WL2 (luckily) an i played an beat it an thats how i beat all WL games. I played super mario land but not the 2nd one but i didnt really like it (its just me thats all). an a few days ago i got this game at gamestore! u should get it too cuz it leaves off after marioland 2 (i know the plot from end of SML2-WL4) ill explain the  storyEND of SML2- Mario defeated wario an got his castle back and warios attempt to take over marioland failed...WL3:SML3- Wario realy wanted a castle but didnt know how to get one until he remembered a rumor about a gang of thieves (forgot name) stole a giant peach/toadstool statue that mario ( yes Mario) was forever  lookin for an Wario thot if he found it first, he could sell it for $$$ to the royal family so he headed off for his gold...and castle of coarse...this is where U come in to help wario on his journey....You can get this game at some Gamestop stores, here from a seller, ebay,etc. its not that hard to find really an 15-20$ is a good deal for this game. WL4 is the easiest to get, then WL3, then WL1 (in my area) but WL2 is quite difficult to find...have fun with this game!

The tonel underpinnings of social commentary through out history makes this much more than a mere Super Nintendo game. The Gameplay is decent and solid. Not profound but competent. I have layed awake at nights thinking about this game's story. I truly find it amazing Nintendo produced something with this kind of depth. They address the moral ambiguities of life, social stratification, slavery, coping with loss, genocide, archeology, as well as good hearted adventure. When was the last time Donkey Kong had a comment on Social Oppresion? When did Mario deal with Historical Trauma? I would like to see more of this side of Nintendo. You know what the makers were going for when they created this game because they made the map to purposely resemble our earth. Not perfectly but close enough to realize the symbolism. They even referrence alot of earths archeology such as; the Nazca Plains, Pyramids, Easter Island, The Great Wall of China, and The tower of Babil, just to name a few.you start out as a kid going on an adventure with your friends and a girl that turns out to be a princess to find your long lost dad who got lost at the tower of Babil or something. Very familiar territory, I know. Next you are talking to a voice in your head that leads you on wild adventures and compels you to leave your group at unusual times.The game has two parts to it. Theres the story part where you are on your adventure with your fellow Goonies and then there is the part where you have your alter ego and you go dungeon crawling. None of your friends get to see you in your awsome form except for the princesss girl.The dungeon part is where the game gets down to buisiness with puzzle solving and monster fighting. You transform into a Knight which is terrific because fighting bosses as a little kid with a flute is weak. Later you take on the form of a liquid metal alien made of pure energy or something. The boss fights are spectacular and the level designs and puzzles are a slice of 16 bit triumph.The sound and graphics are in top Super Nintendo form. The music is solid. As for story.., some people remember reading books ln school like , Lord of the Flies, Tom Sawyer, Clockwork Orange, or whatever. I remember playing this game. For just an unasuming SNES game, there was a lot of stuff going on here. If you see this used for like 20 bucks and you enjoy playing SNES, pick this up. Just remember to get one with the manual. Its a full players guide on how to get every red gem.Bonus/ For a bonus ending, Try finding all the gems. I had the manual and I still missed one someplace in the game.

It could be better, is like saying scarlet johannson is so hot right now, but she was hotter before the boob reduction. So no complains just wished it would be more like past games with more characters and a deeper story. Scarlet Johannson ftw!

I think this game is absoulute perfection.The only thing I wish this game had was more player accuracy.Just like whenever you attack with a general he steps back and then thruste's forward.Well the player should have to press the the back button and then the forward button on the D-pad(direction pad).Anyway's you start of with a long intro and trust me every scene is long.You are a tactician who will help Lyn go through 10 lands.When I first got through Lyn's short 10 chapter's i was so mad because I thought the game was over.But it turn's out that after you finish Lyn's story mode you get Eliwood's story mode.Personally I think Eliwood's story mode is better since you get marcus(a strong paladin) on your team.There are 31 chapter's in all.And the cool thing about this game is that you get 32 character classes.There is a regular class and an advanced class. This is the regular, Knight,myrmidon,merceanery,cavalier,nomad,troubader,peagusesknight,wyvernrider,axefighter,archer,mage,shaman,monk,thief,and pirate. This is the advanced ,General,swordmaster,hero,paladin,nomadictrooper,  valkyrie,falconknight,wyvernlord,warrior,sniper,sage,druid,  bishop,assasin,and berserker.The classes are matched up so since knight is the first on the regulalar list a knight transforms into a general who is the first on the advanced list.Oh yeah,there is also the ultimate classes.Blademaster, greatlord,greatknight,arcshage,and dark druid.The ultimate class is not matched up with the other 2 classes.You get 3 lord's in the game.Hector(axefighter)Lyn(swordfighter)and Eliwood(swordfighter).There are multiple weapon's in the game.Lance's,sword's,axe's,bow's,animamagic,lightmagic,and darkmagic.It's sorta like rock,paper,scissors.Sword's beat axe's,lance's beat sword's and axe's beat lance's.Also anima beats light light beats dark(of course)and dark beat's anima.Bow's don't have a weakness but are good verses peaguses and wyvernrider's.The game really should have been rated for mild violence.And there is some death.Some people say the game has bad graphic's but their just talking about field graphic's.When you attack someone the graphic's are beautiful.And there are also critacle attack's that triple your damage.But I must warn you this game is very addictive.Sometimes I secretly stay up passed my bedtime just to play longer.And also when I get home from school I stay in the car an extra hour just to play.So in conclusion this game is awesome.  Later!!!

I've played Rayman2 and loved so I just couldn't help getting the third installment.  Raymans adventure begins when a red lum scared to death by something turns into crazed blacklums, the blacklum multiplies until only blacklums are left in the core of the world.  After a couple of levels Globox swallows Andre, king of blacklums and those hoodlums won't give globox any peace until Andre comes out, meanwhile you as Rayman need to beat wacked-out levels to get to doctors and free globox of his pesky blacklum.  Thats all really, just one level I need to warn you about, the desert of Knaaren, those guys are creepy!  First they capture globox then they chase you, not to mention they're invinsible AND say weird stuff like &quot;brains&quot; and &quot;tastes better salted&quot;  they are the real meaning of depressing.  Now go buy it!!!!!

It was a good buy, but the console is pretty old.  the light on it is dim, but manageble.  I would recommand to others.

I could knock a few stars off by going on and on about what they SHOULD have put into this game -a playable Princess, animal costumes, Fire Flowers, etc.- but such negativity could foolishly ruin such a great game. Super Mario 64 isn't perfect but it has the best damn gameplay of any action title. The worlds are massive with lots of vibrant colors, whacky enemies, catchy music, and most importantly, gameplay.The only downsides to this game are Mario's horribly annoying voice, an occasionally fussy camera, and the possibility of graining your N64 control stick when you fight Bowser. These minor neusances are mild though and they don't really hinder the gameplay. All other downsides merely point to the characters themselves: Mario speaks with a bad Italian accent voiced by Charles Martinet instead of his old Brooklyn one from the cartoon series. I also don't like the changes made to Princess Toadstool. Instead of the spunky redhead from the cartoon series, she seems more like a "dumb blonde" with a weird voice.Yes, this game is old but, like fine wine, games can get better with age.
I want to say this game rocks. I was left frustrated when I finished the last Mario four times in a row, and when I had to wait six years to finally see a new installment of the happy little Italian plumber. I was expecting something great, and let me tell you that you CAN get your hopes up extremely high. Shigyeru Myamoto and his team of crowd pleaser did a great job. My hopes about this game were by far overwhelmed. The good thing is this game is long. Very long. Unless you know everything by heart there is no way you will finish it in less than thirty hours, accounting for the fact that you want to get all the shines. And there is 120 of them soooo...heheheh! The graphics are excellent, the water effects are the best i've ever seen(maybe along with the water effets in STARFOX Adventures)The sounds are great, although it is pretty hard to hear the characters talk during the cutscenes because the music is very loud (yes, they have actual voices now! Alas, Mario is the only one who does not. Although was given profusion of woohoo's, yehaa's and yahh's for this game by the great Charles Martinet.)The controls are tight, so very tight, like any Mario game, and you can expect finding the trademark moves, like the triple jump, super jump, plus some new ones (about 30), provided by the water nuzzles you get. The only glitch I see in this game are the difficulty at times, where you wish your controller was made of concrete when you throw it at the wall in sheer frustration because you lost 20 lives trying to reach that one platform. And believe, me, it as happened to me and I'am not exagerating. Also, when will anyone figure how to make a platformer with good camera movement. There is always that one platfom you miss because of the lousy camera angle. (sometimes it even comes to having a building between you and the Marioman, where Mario becomes a shadow you see through solid concrete. That was what I liked about Luigi's Mansion. Objects would get transparent.)Other that that I have 51 shines right now, and have not yet resorted to using a guide, but I'm this close.Overall, I give this game 11/10. If you love Mario, and all related to it, get this game as soon as possible. Otherwise, get it anyways.

The only glitch I see in this game are the difficulty at times, where you wish your controller was made of concrete when you throw it at the wall in sheer frustration because you lost 20 lives trying to reach that one platform. And believe, me, it as happened to me and I'am not exagerating. Also, when will anyone figure how to make a platformer with good camera movement. There is always that one platfom you miss because of the lousy camera angle. (sometimes it even comes to having a building between you and the Marioman, where Mario becomes a shadow you see through solid concrete. That was what I liked about Luigi's Mansion. Objects would get transparent.)Other that that I have 51 shines right now, and have not yet resorted to using a guide, but I'm this close.Overall, I give this game 11/10. If you love Mario, and all related to it, get this game as soon as possible. Otherwise, get it anyways.
Super mario 3d world is so fun, it's completely entertaining for the family, I bought this in amazon and I think it's the best game I had ever bought from amazon.com!!&#11088;&#65039;&#11088;&#65039;&#11088;&#65039;

Wii motion plus attachment not needed for this program.
Sometimes going the 3rd party route for game accessories is an okay deal.  However, when choosing a memory card that'll save the data you worked hard for, the Memory Card should be chosen well.Comparison to 3rd Party:Many times, 3rd party brand memory cards promise much space.  For the price, they hold a large amount of game files.  Sadly, many times people lose their data.  Either they are corrupted, it refuses to recognize the card or it keeps asking to reformat the card.  The errors are more consistant, and so far I have never once had a problem with losing my data on the official Gamecube Memory Card by Nintendo.  Buy 3rd Party Memory Cards at your own risk.Comparing less memory versus 251 slots:If you are on a tight budget, (as many gamers are) buying the official Nintendo Memory Card of 59 slots may seem the best way to go.  Sure you get 59 slots, and you feel as if it'll last long enough, but it never seems to.  Sure the 59 slot memory card is roughly $5.00 less, but you are getting significanly less space.  The 251 memory card has 4x the space of the 59 space one.Let's do the Math:251 slots for around: $2059 slots for around: $15Buying the 59 slot Memory Card 4 Times Gives you This:236 Slots for around $60----Overall, buy the official Nintendo Memory Card with 251 slots and you will not only get quality but save money in the long run.

It's about time Nintendo came out with a sizable memory unit that can hold large amount of information. Before now, one had to rely off-brand cards (such as the Nyko 8 MB) for large saves, and they were susceptible to data corruption and the loss of saves. A basic save of Madden, MVP Baseball, or any of the Sims games often took up most of a regular 251 block card. Saving more than that--a season or franchise--was only possible with off-brand cards whose record of reliability was tenuous at best. (Imagine saving a season of Madden and losing it when the card became corrupted). Nintendo-brand cards have an excellent record of stability and reliability. If you need a large card for saving sports or Sims games, this is perfect.

I love Wii Fit Plus.  I just bought it yesterday at Walmart.  I have started with just Wii Fit alone, and had found that Nintendo had released this second disc.  This is by far the better of the two.When I first bought my Wii Fit, I used it to do the Body Test every morning.  I continue to do so, and religiously keep track of my weight progress on my wall calendar.  I enjoyed the convenience of the Wii Fit Channel, and have replaced it with the Wii Fit Plus Channel.  I have noticed that Nintendo has obviously made quite a few improvements upon the software.The Body Test experience with the Wii Fit Plus Channel is very similar to the original.  However, when you step on the balance board to be measured for your Center Of Balance and Body Mass Index, the software tells you to keep still.  The original Wii Fit software does not.I also find that some of the exercises on the original Wii Fit you have to unlock by doing others.  I've noticed that this is not true with Wii Fit Plus.  Most of the exercises on Wii Fit Plus start out unlocked, and are never locked.  This way you have a greater choice of exercise activities to choose from when working out with Wii Fit Plus, rather than with original Wii Fit.I am glad that I purchased this software.  It increases my motivation and use of Wii Fit.  If you purchase a copy, you perhaps can follow me down the path of fun and easygoing exercise and weight loss.
This review is for Wii Sports Resort for the Nintendo Wii. This game is great, it is the second Wii Sports game released for the Wii. It contains 12 games- Swordplay, Wakeboarding, Frisbee, Archery, Basketball, Table Tennis, Golf, Bowling, Power Cruising, Canoeing, Cycling, and Air Sports. The game requires a Wii Remote Plus to play. My only complaint about the game is that it did not include Wii Boxing, from the first version of Wii Sports.-Swordplay lets you use your Wii Remote Plus as a sword to battle your friends or computer players.-Wakeboarding makes your Wii Remote Plus the handlebars of a wakeboard, and you get pulled around by a boat.-Archery is my personal favorite- using the Wii Remote Plus and Nunchuk as a bow and arrow, you can target shoot for the most points.-Basketball lets you use the Wii Remote Plus to shoot baskets and play 3-on-3 basketball.-Table tennis makes your Wii Remote Plus a paddle, and you can play with a friend or computer player.-Golf uses your Wii Remote Plus as a club, and you can play a round of golf.-Bowling makes you use your Wii Remote Plus to bowl a game with your friends.-Power Cruising is similar to Wakeboarding, except you use the Wii Remote Plus to drive a jet ski on the water.-Canoeing lets you use the Wii Remote Plus as a canoe paddle to race on the water.-Cycling uses the Wii Remote Plus and Nunchuk to pedal a bicycle.-Air Sports uses the Wii Remote Plus as an airplane, and you can fly around the in-game island.
The Wii Fit is a great addition to the Wii system, while it is not a substitute to get out and hitting the gym or doing some road miles, it is a fun way of getting into a home exercise routine. If you don't have a Yoga instructor handy, the Wii provides one for one, including some fun and tough poses. The four areas of training on the Fit, other than the Yoga are Strength, Aerobics and the Balance games. The strength training is cool, I generally never bothered with push-ups until now, that and other exercises you can include your own free-weights with are addictive with the Wii points and unlocking of reps and routines. The step aerobics are fun and more useful than the Fit's jogging in place while exploring the virtual island.But, the hula hoop with multiple hoops are a super workout. Finally, the Wii Fit's games to aid in balance are fun and sometimes pretty hard, rolling marbles into platform holes, tightrope walking, soccer heading and more unlockables.The Fit evaluates your Body Mass Index, weight and balance, keeps track of your progress and more. One downside, is while aiding you in tracking wt. and such, if you are overweight (according to ht. and age norms) it will tell you where you need to be and the body shape of your Mii (or the character representing you) will be "subtlely" altered, but only in the opening BMI section, which you can skip. Also, the ladies (or gents) who want to keep their wt. a secret can put a password on their profile, too.Down the line their are more Fit tie-ins on the way, using the board for skating and Rayman's Rabbid's are on the way with one, as well. I recommend the charger, while the board doesn't drink batteries like the remotes, it is still a good idea. As is the skin to protect your board and yoga mat to protect you.
The Wii fit craze is an innovative method of exercise.  You start out with establishing a profile giving your Wii fit age and Body mass index.  It was funny seeing my Mii change from a small guy to a big plump Mii.  So even though my body fat is low, the Body Mass Index is high.  There is a caveat to just assessing body composition by one parameter.There are 4 different methods of exercise.  Strength training, yoga, aerobics and balance exercise.  I never thought that a video game system would actually wear me out like an exercise video would but this can and will challenge you physically.  As you continue your fitness pursuit, you can track your progress.Of the games, I feel that the Ski slalom and snowboard slalom to be the most fun of the group, with the tightrope as a distant 3rd.However, the best value of this package is the versatility of the balance board to use in other games.  As more and more games are developed to take advantage of this peripheral, it will become a must have in your Nintendo Wii system.I highly recommend this system not only for the Wii fit disk but also for the balance board which really adds to the allure of such a versatile gaming system.  Once you sync the board to your system, you are set.  However, I strongly recommend rechargeable batteries since it appears to drain through batteries faster than other Wii remotes.  The board is solid in construction and wide enough for most individuals.  It is surprisingly heavy and sturdy, too.CAVEAT: There is a stated limit of 300 lbs for users.  I would personally go 10% under that limit if you want to be safe.
Wii Fit is the next logical step after people across the country developed weight loss plans around playing tennis, boxing and bowling on Wii Sports.  This "game" borrows the exercise/conditioning elements of Wii Sports and builds them into a full exercise program.  Although none of the 40 exercises in Wii Fit offer the enjoyment of playing tennis against a friend, the plethora of options in this package breaks the monotony of people who tried playing tennis alone everyday for 30 minutes, followed by 15 minutes of boxing, etc.The groundbreaking technology behind Wii Fit is the balance board.  It accurately measures every subtle movement and momentum nuance as you step and shift. It independently analyzes the input from your left and right foot, compiling the data to tell you if you are performing the activities correctly.  You overall health score is determined not just by how much you weigh, but by how quick, balanced and precise you are able to move.The second real jewel of Wii Fit is the daily check-in, where your weight, BMI and balance are all calculated and tracked.  I believe the exercises with Wii Fit should be done in conjunction with more legit activities (jogging/walking, playing basketball, swimming, etc) for best results, but the check-in option rivals and betters anything you could gain by going to weekly visits to Weight Watchers or other exercise plan providers.  Having your weight and fitness age on display each day is a great motivator.Wii Fit isn't a perfect workout tool by any means.  But it is a really innovative program  that features a robust list of exercise "games" and creates an environment in which working out is less daunting.  I also believe it will springboard people into more legit forms of exercise.  If you really want to lose weight, starting out with Wii Fit is a great first step.  Even as your fitness increases and the exercises contained become less challenging, you'll still continue to use the BMI calculator to track your progress.  That alone is almost worth the price, but for most of us, reaching that stage would be months if not years away.

I've been playing adventure games since the original Crowther & Woods ADV.COM for CP/M, then later Infocom's Zork series (and others, including Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy), and on and on until finally I got hooked on the Tomb Raider series on Macintosh.  In other words, I know whereof I speak when I say Wind Waker may be the best adventure-style game I've ever played.  In my humble opinion, the Legend of Zelda games rank as one of the great crown jewels of Japan, right up there with Nikons, Toyotas and Zen.  The game starts slowly, and builds and builds ... and builds ... and builds ... until, when the little guy finally defeats the Big Hands in the Tower of the Gods ... and you enter the strange, black and white eeriness in the Castle beneath the Sea ... and you realize you've only just BEGUN to play this game, when at THAT point you realize you've been spending so much time in front of your TV and your GameCube because THAT world is so immeasurably more fascinating than THIS world, it strikes you:  What Nintendo has done defines magic.  Shakespeare at his finest could do this for an evening; Nintendo does it for days, weeks, and even longer.  Ok, that's hyperventilating, so enuff said.  But still!  Unless you have a deficient attention span or a prehuman intolerance for puzzles and mystery, PLAY THIS GAME.  Allow me to add, parts of Wind Waker are not specifically aimed at kids.  The final showdown with the Big Poe was both hilarious and immensely satisfactory, philosophically speaking.  I found myself thinking of schizophrenia, Dante's Inferno and the Stapuft Marshmallow Man simultaneously.  Mostly droll, occasionally satirical, Wind Waker sometimes walks a fine and perceptive line between storytelling and proscenium-bending sarcasm.  Example:  Why does the Nintendo Gallery sculptor hate Link's pictograph of Lenzo and his lady friend?  Because Link (i.e, you, dear gamer) acquired it by stealth!

As an avid fan of words in general, I decided, upon learning of its existence, to purchase 100 Classic Books for the Nintendo DS.First things first: all of the books included in the software are now out of copyright, so some people will invariably scoff at the idea of paying actual money for them, particularly since they can be had legally for free on places like [...]. This is certainly a valid point. My feelings on the matter are thus: I like to read, but I am not terribly fond of reading books on the computer. Had I an e-reader such as the Kindle or the Nook, there might be little reason for me to purchase a title such as this. However, decent e-readers are still relatively expensive, and then there's the cost of a cover or case to help protect the thing, and possibly the optional protection plan, etc.  Without having used one at any length, I'm not sure whether or not it would be worth it to me to drop the coin required for such a purchase.Since I already have a DS, making a small purchase like 100 Classic Books is a much easier pill to swallow in order to dip my toe in the waters of e-book reading.When the title starts up, there is a pleasant and soothing tune playing, as an owl flies across a row of books and settles on the non-touch screen to watch you. The owl also serves another feature. If the thought of choosing what to read from the 100 books available is somewhat daunting, you can ask the owl for a recommendation. He'll ask you a few questions about what you want to read (length, genre, reading level, etc.) and make a suggestion based on your answers.You can also get recommendations through the online rankings. Once you connect to the Nintendo WFC, you can update the rankings on the books, and there will be stickers applied to various books that are the highest rated in several categories (most romantic, most humorous, most scary, best overall book, etc.). This is a neat little feature, but wholly unnecessary, particularly since most people won't want to keep going online just to update the rankings again and again. Whilst connected to Nintendo WFC, you also have the option to download ten additional books to the software, which immediately integrate themselves into the bookshelf (there's a little "DL" on the bottom of the spine of each book so you can see which ones are hard-coded in the software and which are DLC).You can recommend books yourself after you've finished reading them (or after you've skipped ahead to the last page and "finished" the book if you're just eager to give a high rating to your favorite book). You get to rate it from 1 to 10 and then pick an adjective that describes it (the adjectives correspond to the categories a book can be stickered in).There are really only two things that are important in a title such as this, and that's the quality of the books and the quality of the interface.I've typed up a list of the books at the bottom of this review, and there is quite a large variety available across all genres, which is a plus. With authors ranging from Louisa May Alcott to Oscar Wilde, and the books themselves going from 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea to Wuthering Heights, there is literally something enjoyable here for practically anyone who even remotely likes to read.The one big problem I had with the books is that there are sporadic typos to be found. As an example, there's a passage in The Jungle Book which erroneously says "hoys" instead of "boys" (on page 376 if you are using the standard font size). They're not everywhere, but I found a couple in the Jungle Book and elsewhere (I've only read a few books in the game). However, they are very off-putting when you find them, and it puts a bit of a taint on what is otherwise a very solid title.As for the interface, it is so intuitive that practically anyone could figure it out within a matter of seconds. However, there's also a tutorial that plays the first time you start the game (which you can skip if you so desire). You hold the DS sideways (like a book - clever, no?), and you can use either the buttons or the screen to turn the page. The d-pad or face buttons (depending on whether you're a righty or lefty) can be used to turn the page left or right, and you can optionally set the shoulder buttons to change pages as well. On the screen itself, tapping the left or right side of the touch screen will turn the page back or forward. You can also slide the stylus across if you want a more "realistic" page-turning motion.You can set up to three different bookmarks per book. This is nice if you have a particular passage that you want to refer to later, or if you have multiple people reading off one cartridge. If you want to remove a bookmark, just go to that page and take it out. Or you can simply place it somewhere else in the book and it will move automatically (you don't have to go and pick it up before you can set it down somewhere else, which is nice).The font size can be changed between two settings, and I found both to be quite easy to read. There's also several background ambient noise choices you can use. Some of them are a little unpleasant (actually, both the music selections of "Classic" and "Easy Listening" sounded a little too harsh and synthesized for me to enjoy reading by), but I found some that were very relaxing and actually enhanced the reading experience ("Summer Night" is my favorite, but "Moving Train" and "Park" are both good too).It's obvious that a lot of work went into making the interface as smooth and as intuitive as possible, and it really shows. It's extremely well thought out, though it's not perfect. One glaring omission is the lack of a dictionary to look up unfamiliar words (I understand that the Kindle has a built-in dictionary for just such a purpose). With all the books being from 1922 or prior, it is not uncommon to run into many unfamiliar words, particularly from the international authors such as Tolstoy, Kipling, or Hugo. Secondly, there's no search functionality. Unless you've bookmarked the page, you're stuck hopping from page to page looking for whatever phrase or quote you wanted to find. Another feature that would have been nice (though it isn't strictly necessary) is a text-to-speech feature (also included in the latest model of the Kindle). Synthesized speech has made many advances over the past decades, and although it's not perfect, it would be nice to be able to turn on a text-to-speech function if I wanted to listen to a book whilst browsing Amazon, for example.One of the other interesting things you might notice is a lack of an ESRB rating for this title. Apparently, due to the content being entirely literature-based, this title does not require any age classification. Granted it doesn't affect the software in any way, but it might be a bit of a collector's oddity for this reason.So, as I mentioned at the top of the review, I basically purchased this as an experiment to see whether I would get any use out of an e-reader before I whip out the wallet and buy one. So how did the experiment go?  Well, I just placed my order for a Kindle.And now, here's a list of books included with the software (Books with an asterisk are not on the cartridge, but are available for download via Nintendo WFC):Louisa May Alcott: Little WomenJane Austen: Emma, Pride and Prejudice, Sense and SensibilityL. Frank Baum: The Wonderful Wizard of OzR.D.

Wells: The Time MachineEdith Wharton: The Age of InnocenceOscar Wilde: The Happy Prince and Other Stories*, The Importance of Being Earnest, The Picture of Dorian GrayThis list differs significantly from the 100 Classic Book Collection released in the UK. The UK version is a lot more focused on British Authors, and includes quite a few more titles from Jane Austen, the Bront Sisters, Dickens, and Shakespeare. The US release has a wider variety of authors from many countries, although there is far less variety per author (Dickens and Shakespeare had some titles cut, but they're still fairly well represented).
Paper Mario number 2 is nintendo's much needed RPG. The gamecube(or nintendo) hasen't had a good role player since the first 'slim n' trim' mario game, and this is flat out fantastic.The plot isen't to surprising, Princess Peach gets kidnapped agian for the upmost time, but at least not from Bowser, from an evil army of 'surfer-dude' sounding X-nauts. Bowser is a playable character in the game, but not really an important character. The plot is that ,besides Peach being kidnapped, Mario came to the Husler filled town of Roughsport, on Peach's will, to find seven crystal stars which open the Door, supposedly is filled with treasure(but is not). He travels from all the locations on his magical map which shows where the stars are. The X-nauts are hunting for them, as well as Bowser is, and you do incouter the 'nauts numerous times. In each place the stars are, their is a party member as well as a pathitic boss fight. During your diffrent chapters, you find many intresting things, as the mafia, wrestling arenas', and the moon, also the lottery & Luwigi who is on his own mission to find Princess Eclaire in a totally origonal adventure. You also get to use the diffrent functions of paper: boat, airplane, thin, and tube.Heres an extra, to obtian the mouse theif Ms. Mowz, look for an anonamus trouble at the trouble center. And last of all, at the end of the 100 trials pit is something very speacial, I won't say what, but here a hint, it's a very speacial badge.

The Wind Waker captures the saterday morining cartoon visual on a game. With all the bizzare weapons like the deku leaf and wind waker you solve surpisingly intresting puzzels as you hunt for you sister Ayrell.The Zelda makers used mostly recycled emeimes  and one of the origainal bad-boys Ganon(or Ganondorf).

With all the bizzare weapons like the deku leaf and wind waker you solve surpisingly intresting puzzels as you hunt for you sister Ayrell.The Zelda makers used mostly recycled emeimes  and one of the origainal bad-boys Ganon(or Ganondorf).

No.  "Mario 64" is still the king of the Nintendo 64 crop, however this comes close enough to be second or third.  First anounched as "Twelve Tales: Conker 64," Conker was supposed to be about Conker trying to save his girlfriend Berri from an evil cake and/or acorn (???)!  You would romp through a "Banjo-Kazooi" world, with "Banjo-Kazooi" style gameplay, and final there were many resemblences to "Banjo-Kazooi!"  For instence you collected golden acorns to unlock new levels, which much resembled the idea of the gold puzzle pieces you collected in, you gussed it, "Banjo-Kazooi!"However game sites deemed it way too cute, so Rare went back to the drawing board and came up with "Conker's Bad Fur Day" one year later.  Now the once cute squirle Conker cusses, vomits, swims in peoples (...) and (...), and spoofs every movie he can think of (Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan, JAWS, Terminater 2, The Matrix, and Mission Impossable to name a few)!  While most of the game is vugar as heck (And is very well deserved of the M rating), it's also funny as heck!Another good thing about the game is the different approch in the gameplay department.  Instead of the normal gameplay found in most Rare games, Conker now has to do more puzzle solving, jumping, swimming, and even shooting to keep the mature gamers intrest!  You honestly are never sure how your going to play the game next!  One minute I was herding cheese around, the next I was trying to make cows (...) out as much, well (...), out of their bodies as I possably could!  Oh and then I was in a warfield being attacked by Tediez (Don't ask), and then being...Dracula!?!CBFD is by no means perfect.  For thing the main game is too short, while the muti-player modes are pretty boring!  Plus there's only so much I can take of a cussing squirle before I get sick of playing this thing!  As long as your over 17 I highly recomend this game...as a rental!  But if you find it for [price] or less, then I gusse you can't go wrong.

Ok, I bought this game for the Wiimote.  I thought why not, it comes with a wiimote.  I think that this is a fun game.  You get to play duckhunt, tanks, ping pong, find Mii, pool, Pose Mii, lazer hockey, fish, and race on a cow.  The games are fun, but they get a little boring after you play them a hundred times.  My favorites are duckhunt and find Mii.  I recommend this game not only because it comes with a Wiimote, but because the game scan be fun if you get bored with the other Wii games that you have.
This is a game that is like N.F.L. Blitz, just hockey. Because of how it is very unrealistic. There are 3 players on the ice. Codes for using a hockey ball, or tennis ball. Goalies get checked, and can check. Players become on fire. You can be aliens, soldiers, poneys, totempoles, and about 20 others. There also are no penalties. This, though, is a fun game.

If the game came without the Wiimote, I wound't touch it with a ten foot pole. Amusing two-player games like Found Mii, Pool, Target Practice and Tanks are heaped in with a few mediocre or sometimes frustratingly difficult to control games like Fishing and Laser Hockey.I'd say it's well worth the $10 if you need the Wiimote, but temper your expectations before you buy.
I laugh every time I turn this game on.  It's a never-ending comedy.  Usually, I look for games with direction.  I immediately knew this game had no direction.  But it's funny!  I live to fight with potty-mouthed dung beetles and hook up a fat bumble-bee king with a big-breasted sunflower.  Mutant robot haystacks, singing piles of... exploding rats, and drunk scarecrows; these are the makings of a classic.Buy the game.  You will love it.

well, it's a game that's a cross from tamagotchi, and the sims haha.  Well, you can create Mii's, import your Mii's and have street pass on to get Mii's while walking around.  I find most people have that feature off though lol.  But anyways,  you start with this empty island,  you create your first me, usually yourself and they pop up in an apartment.  Each Mii gets their own apartment and as you nourish each Mii, and help encourage socializing with the other Mii's and buying the correct foods and clothes and things for each of the Mii's personalities, you get money and items to help keep feeding and clothing and what not your Mii population.  As the Mii population grows and you keep your Mii's happy, the town opens up one store after another, all the while you still have to feed, talk to, buy clothes, etc for each one, so as your island grows in population, your whole day is shot by having to socialize with all your Mii's haha.  So far, I only scratched the surface, but i'm sure the interactions with all the Mii's gets a little complicated later.  5 for now as it's been sort of entertaining so far.  Oh and the game might have a bug, mine kept saying can't read sdhc card although the one supplied by Nintendo is still there.
I think the whole family will enjoy playing the various games although I found the table tennis and tank games a bit daunting. (Need more Practice!). Target shooting with fly-by ducks may offend some sensibilities.

Hey! So I'm assuming that you are reading this because you what the game is but you are a little unsure on whether you want this game or not. RIGHT? If you have absolutely no idea what this game is about, don't waste your time here, go do some research first (google it!). The point of this is to help you decide, this is not a review that will tell you my opinion and let you learn more about this game. If you want to learn a little more about this game first, you should go read other reviews and come back to this. So, keep on reading if you know what this game is about and is UNSURE on whether to get this game or not.Let me guess, probably from seeing all these positive reviews right? I had the same experience too. All my friends got it and said it was amazing but I was still unsure about wether to get it or not. IF THIS IS YOU... then I'm going to help you a bit :) if not, don't waste time reading this. Go right read other reviews.OK. To help you decide, go through the little "flowchart" I've made. Start with #1, read it and answer yes or no. After you've done that, go the the next question corresponding to your answer. Let me help you with the first question, Do you enjoy shooting games? if your answer was no, you would go read #3 and then answer that question to go to the next and the next until you've reached a verdict.1) Do you enjoy shooting games? YES (go to #2) NO (go to #3)2) Are you good with the touch-screen on the 3DS? YES (go to #5) NO (go to #7)3) Is this game a present? YES (go to #13) NO (go to #4)4) Do you play your 3DS at home more than on the go? YES (go to #6) NO (go to #9)5) Do you play more than 30 min at a time? YES (go to #8) NO (go to #7)6) Are you interested in trying a shooting game? YES (go to #5) NO (go to #10)7) Do you get frustrated easily? YES (go to #10) NO (go to #4)8) Like playing with friends? YES (go to #11) NO (go to #12)9) Have steady hands? YES (go to #5) NO (go to #10)10) Tight on money? YES (go to C) NO (go to B)11) Have little or no games on your 3DS? YES (go to A) NO (go to B)12) Do you like collecting every items in a game? YES (go to #11) NO (go to #10)13) Is this person 10 or older? YES (go to A) NO (go to C)A) GET THIS GAME! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR???B) YOU'LL LOVE THIS GAME. BUT NOT NOW. MAYBE LATER. Buy only if you get that "urge" of getting this game. If you don't know what I'm talking about... don't get this yet. I would recommend waiting for a price drop or a special deal.C) Nah, maybe you should think about it more. You might end up wasting your money on a game you're not going to enjoy. (I'm not saying you won't but you should do some more research before you decide)
This game was released in the early 90's, a time in which video game makers still focused more on fun gameplay rather than graphics and sound.  These days it seems more and more video game makers just want bragging rights for the best graphics and sound, therefore abandoning the most important aspect of the game; rushing out games that are clearly not finished and very little regard to actual gameplay.With that being said, at the time Zelda:Link to the past had very good graphics and sound to boot.  But what kept me playing this game over and over again was the fun gameplay!  I originally got this game when I got a replacement SNES and this game was bundled with it.  It took me over a year to play it, because I thought to myself, there is no way it could be better than the original Zelda on the NES.  One day I decided to pop this game in and realized that I was WRONG!  This was the most fun game I had ever played on the SNES even better than Super Metroid in many aspects.  It was very easy to pick up and play and easy to learn.  Once I started playing, I just could not stop.  It took all the aspects I loved from the original Zelda on the NES and multiplied them!This game was very succesful in capturing the nostagalistic feel of the original game while at the same time allowing me to enjoy a brand new one.  Absolutely fantastic.You still have to search for heart pieces, weapons, upgrades etc, but this game like the original makes it fun rather than tedious and boring.  I got a real sense of accomplishment when I found a new item and a even greater feeling when I finally beat the game.  This game was fun from start to finish and was never once bored, when I stopped playing this game after a long sitting, it was because I physically couldn't continue, not because I was bored or tired of playing the game.  In fact if I picked this game up today, I know that I will STILL enjoy it as much as I did back then!Its too bad that these days, I am finding myself rushing through a game just to finish it because other than the great graphics the gameplay is subpar and it gets boring after a while.  Rushing through a game causes one not to really appreciate the game and it tells me that the gameplay is lacking and the developers did not do enough to keep the player involved.Honestly, if I had to choose between a game with superior gameplay and OK graphics or a game with superior graphics and OK gameplay, I would choose the gameplay over the graphics everytime. While you get your occasional blockbuster on today's systems, for the most part the games are just all fluff and no substance!

This game is excellent any way you put it. I remember playing it for the first time about 12 or 13 years ago (yeah that IS a very long time), and I thought it was just the greatest thing ever. The graphics were supurb and even to this day they look beautiful. Though they don't stand up to ps2 graphics...it really doesn't matter with these old-skool games. I'm not a graphics kind of guy and never was, so it doesn't affect me, but if you are really into high tech graphics and haven't played this, i doubt you will like it. Don't get me wrong, some games with more high tech graphics are good, but this game (along with many others on SNES) proove that graphics don't make any game. But then again I don't play or own a playstation 2, so that's just how I see it. My views on videogames are rather conservative. If you are still under 16 and haven't played this game I doubt you will like it though, as it doesn't appeal to younger payers any more due to it's old school design that kids tend not to appreciate these days. But that doesn't mean kids won't like it. I just think people who have played it in the early 90s are mainly the ones who will enjoy it nowdays, unless you're a Zelda fanatic but haven't played this one yet, or if you like older games but haven't gotten around to getting this one yet. The music on this game is also very good, although the dungeon music can get very tedius and annoying, it's not that bad. The world music is classic, though and after you play it enough it will be ringing in your ears. Gameplay also doesn't get much better, you get a whole arsenal of items. Much more than any other Zelda yet. This game is basically the game that set the standards for all other adventure games, sometimes even RPGs. Another thing you might like about this game is that it is not way too time consuming, if you have a life to attend to you can do so while keeping up with the game as well. Even though I like really long games, this game is short in a good way. But the first time you play it , it will probably take more than 10 hours to beat, at least. If you get all the heart containers it will take even more. There isn't a lot of text in this game either, there's talking sequences but they usually end pretty quick...All in all this game is classic, and if you haven't played it-that's your mistake. Playing this game and hearing it's music after years really brings back those great childhood memories. Even to this day this game looks better to me than most new games. It just has that aura. I highly recommend this to any one into adventure games or RPGs that has a taste for the classics, or anyone who likes SNES or NES games.

I got this as a present from a family member and have already beat the game 4 times. I dunno how to explain this game. It feels like I hopped in a time machine and traveled back to the past, only I ended up in the future, where everything was better, but I was still in the past, I don't even know where the present begins to fall into all of this... See? This is what happens when you play this game...Ok I'm gonna do a different kind of review here, not your average review.This game is FUN. I've noticed things from a wide range of mario games all in one in this game, and everything in this game only made it better. I can't beat many games 4 times in a row, so that should tell you how fun this game is. You're gonna want to play this with a friend for the best experience. I recommend playing with your girlfriend lol. I beat this game the first time alone, had TONS of fun. Then I beat it with my girlfriend, had even more fun than before. THEN, I beat it with my family. I'm talking 4 player action from start to finish. My two sisters, cousin, and I, all sat down and beat this game in a day. Speed run FTW lol. By then this game wasn't even fun anymore, it was beyond fun, which is a word I never heard of. People were laughing, screaming, yelling, jumping, all over the room. The noise level went through the roof. I'm sure all the neighbours heard, and my grandmother started yelling at us to shut the hell up lol.Let me make this clear. I don't like spending time with my sisters or my cousin. They're not my age, and me being older, don't really "click" with the current interest of teens and kids today, especially girls, since I'm a guy. We never do ANYTHING together, or have fun when we attempt to. THIS damn game, broke down barriers, LITERALLY lol. God I can't remember the last time I sat down with family for so long and had so much non-stop fun. At one point in time everything literally slowed down during all the laughter etc and I was looking around at all of us and thought to myself "I can't believe this, we're actually bonding, & it took Mario to do it". I literally got a tear in my eye, but only a little tear lol. I started remembering the old days when I was a kid, when everyone was closer. When it was over, we all got up and went our separate ways hahaha. I wished it could go on, and it did, when we beat the game AGAIN lol.I usually don't come at this angle when I do reviews, but I just had to do this to let people know this is a great game for all ages, genders, and backgrounds. You gotta love & respect Nintendo for doing what they do, even in a world that indirectly pulls everyone apart in their own little corner of the room with their own gadgets. Nintendo is still the best at bringing people together with their games, and as an old school gamer who's been gaming since the NES & Sega, to me, that's what it's all about. Online is fun, but to have old school multiplayer gaming at it's finest in this day and age, to have your living room full of players having fun, when the fun's right there, & you're not just playing with a bajillion people while still sitting in your living room all alone...*shakes head* lol online can't touch this kind of experience with a stick. If you're stuck somewhere wondering how to get your family to do fun things together again, make it easy on yourself. Walk into a store and pick up a copy of this game. Peace.
Many a gamer will without a doubt have played this game! This was the first game I ever played...EVER and let me tell you that this is the game that got me started on being a gamer!  The first side-scrolling adventure ever made and it was great.But if you're not an old-skool gamer or you're just so much more impressed with all the new stuff then you might as well skip this. Let me say that a game shouldn't be judged based on it's age, graphics and sound alone.  This game taught me that the importance of a game was it's gameplay and that my friends is what this game is all about.First let me say this though, there was one moment in this game that made me realize that games are meant to be explored, and you know what that is? That invisible block in the first level! When I first found that invisible block I was in awe because it was in the middle of NO WHERE but just appeared.  I actually let that one-up get away the first time. I'd never seen anything like it before in ANYTHING!Now I know that people complain, &quot;Oh you can't save&quot; and &quot;You only get three lives and when you die you start from the beginning&quot; and &quot;There's a @#$%^&amp;* time limit!&quot; and of course everyone's favorite &quot;These graphics suck&quot; and second favorite &quot;The game is too short&quot;.  Well, as I said it isn't the age that counts.  For it's time these graphics were some of the best the world had ever seen!  Also, the ability to save your game wasn't in thought yet (Metroid was one of the first games to even use the &quot;Password&quot; system).  You got three lives on just about EVERY game back then and as I said, saving hadn't been thought of.  The lentgh? You certainly wouldn't think so now but Super Mario was one of the longest games in the world when it was released! For today's standards the difficulty has gone down (but I'd still say it's easier than the majority of XBOX, PS2 and GCN games) but not by much.  The game can still be hard but it's easy to master. In fact this game started a series of Video Game challenges in which people did crazy things like go through the entire game without grabbing a single mushroom on one life WITHOUT warping! I remember doing that as well.For the ages this game is freakishly awesome.  Even those born in my time would know this game pretty well and have fun with it (Some of us were like what...one? two? three? etc.?)Truly if you're an NES fanatic and an old-skool gamer this is one game you CANNOT be without!

I am a huge Kirby fan as is my five year old son. We have almost every Kirby game out there and many of the toys as well. If you were a fan of the wii game than this is a must buy because the graphics and game play are very similar to that game. There are a few new powers that are fun to use and the art is beautiful. If you will be playing on a 3ds the 3D does look pretty cool.If you are a hardcore gamer that loves to play the most challenging game out there then this game is not for you, but if you want a fan game with a great story that is not so hard you want to pull your hair out, give this game a try. It is a little difficult for my five year old because of some of the new features (hypernova Kirby where he has to suck up objects while backing up). I am sure with time he will get better with it. He loves trying and he loves the mini fighter games.What I love about this Kirby game and many others is that fighting the bosses is only half the battle. Much of the game is spent looking for jewels and key chains. I love that there is some exploring to do after the game is over or a level has been beaten. I have read some reviews that claim the game is too easy, but if you find it too easy use a different power or try going into battle without a power. I find the game to be the perfect level of difficulty. I hate playing games that seem impossible. Kirby is a fun game for all ages and I would highly recommend it!
This is one of the best games Nintendo ever created. Certainly, it's well worth your money, even though it's an expensive game. It has excellent 3D graphics that really fit the game play. I know graphics DO NOT make a game, but these graphics make the game better than it would be with horrible graphics. The story is engaging and absolutely hilarious at times. The inventory system is also well thought out. The battles are fun, and are never dull. The world map is also very pretty. The music is also very fitting to the game play, and very catchy at that. The Culex theme is also very pleasant to hear. But now, on to the most important part of this review, and the most important thing about the game itself: the game play. The game play is absolutely spectacular! Basically, it makes for a superlative game. Even though this game is expensive, you should get it. I hope that my review convinced you to get the game. It's one of the best games Nintendo made. By the way, I play it on the original console, and I would recommend that you do the same.

My only complaint about this game is after you beat it and hook it up to the Game Cube to unlock the orginal Metroid, you can't use the GBA as a controler. I find the GC controler a bit useless on a game that only had A, B &amp; select. I think I just needed the feel of the orginal controler to have the full effect.

Many have wanted to compare this to Fifa 2002. I will give the true comparison that all you soccer game fans want to here. First in graphics Fifa wins. That is my opinion all though it is fairly arguable. Fifa has detailed player animations and realistic fields (the grass in my opinion is jaw dropping). Yet in soccer slam you will see bright cartoonish graphics. No, this is not aa bad thing it actually brings a nice fun tone to the game. Sound goes to Soccer slam in my opinion. Why the announcer is a weird cowboy guy who makes you laugh with his wild antics. The music is lacking but the players make up with it with their insults that leave you laughing to the point where it hurts. Fifa's sound is also great. The thing i disliked was the monotonous announcers. The thing that was good was the in-game souns and soundtrack featuring songs by the guerriliz. In fun soccer slam wins. The players are original and cool. From a scottish boxer to an african medicine man. There are three players and a goalie per team. There are cool kicks and exiting passes. Yes, you can hit your opponent without being charged with a foul. Fifa too is fun  but lacks character originality and a fast paced game. The final category is replay value. I believe Fifa has more replay value. In soccer slam once you have beaten the continental cup you feel like you are done. Soccer slam features 6 teams and 9 feilds. Fifa has countless teams, challenges, and goals. Which leaves you coming back for more. A few last notes are the multiplayer is very fun ...Thankyou for your time

I got this... well actually my brother got it... game for Easter. Now, to my 8-year-old brother, of course it's the coolest thing! It's like having a real Pikachu in your own house! I must admit, it is very neat. It's inexpensive, and you can play it for hours. You start off by meeting Pikachu and Prof. Oak (For you people who don't know Pokemon, Prof. Oak is, you could say, the founder of Pokemon.) and explains stuff. You then continue along and say "Pikachu!" Into the microphone, and he responds. I yelled "Idiot," "Eiffel Tower," and "Haley Barry" to Pikachu, and he didn't respond. Once I said "Pikachu!" he perks up. How cool is that?This game has absolutely no plot. It has even lesser of a plot than "Dude, Where's my car." (Which is almost impossible.) Even though I'm 13, this game is still entertaining to me. Pikachu does respond to your commands (90% of the time.) The VRU (Voice-recognition unit) isn't the same as Stephen Spielberg's "Artificial Intelligence," but it makes the grade. Of course, when you're fishing, Pikachu does tend to ignore you. I will say "Pull!" and he'll release it. Once I said, "You're so cute!" (Because Prof. Oak told me too.) and Pikachu electrocuted me and had an angry face, and his "affection" level went down substantially. What it very cool is if you say "Quiz time!" while in the house. Pikachu will flash 10 pokemon, and you say their names into the microphone. It will actually tell you if it's right or wrong! However, I think about 3/10 of the time, it will not recognize the right answer, and mark it wrong. Sometimes Pikachu will press a wrong button (not your fault, his.) and you will suffer. Overall, gameplay's a 9/10It's 64-bits, so you can't expect much. All characters are pretty impressive looking. Except when you play Quiz time, it is in 2D. The rest is very nice. Pikachu cannot talk, but he communicates with the tone of his voice, and sometimes a little word balloon will pop up, but it will be a picture. (A flower for "I understand," a light bulb for "I have an Idea," and a little black lined scribble if he is discouraged.) Sometimes the game glitches. Pikachu will run, then all of a sudden he will be in between a tree. It is very strange. Overall, except for the glitches, graphics deserve a 9/10.The sound is important. Pikachu's tone will tell you his feelings. Most sounds are normal. Oddish goes "Oddish!" Poliwag goes "Poli! Poli!" and Charmander goes "Chaaaar! Chaaaar!" The music gets highly annoying though, like a broken record. When you move, a hand goes to the closest item. The weird sfx gets really aggravating. It's not even a sound! It sounds like a single maraca shake. It's really weird. Overall, the sound gets an 8.75/10Speed is normal. Because it is N64 cartridge, it is very fast. Unlike the new Gamecube, which because of mass producing and increased game space, with CD's that take loading time, HYP is very fast. There is no loading time, and it takes less than half a second between days, where it saves your progress. Speed gets a perfect 10/10.Now, the one thing I MUST complain about is the controlling. I cannot stand it! Ok, if you hold Z and talk then release it, a bubble is sent to Pikachu (with your comments) which works fine. But when you are trying to move around, your screen always shows Pikachu. You can be holding up and he will be going left or right. I cannot stand it, and if you buy it you will understand my aggravation. The controls get a crummy 6/10.The replay value is great. You can always play a level again, and fishing is highly addicting, along with pi&ntilde;ata party. You will play it over and over. Some games, like Caring for Caterpie, are not that much fun, and will probably only be played for Pikachu Points. The replay will get a special 10.5/10 because it is so amazing.Overall, between all the Pokemon games on the N64, Hey You Pikachu is probably the best in original plot and replay.Let's review:Gameplay: 9/10Graphics: 9/10Sound: 8.75/10Speed: 10/10Controls: 6/10Replay value: 10.5/10Total: 53.25/60 giving Hey You, Pikachu! an 88.75.

Pokemon Diamond, Pearl and Platinum are all very good games that all take place in the sinnoh region. But if you had one to pick, get Platinum.Why?Platinum has legendary Pokemon Palkia, Dialga AND Giratina as the storyline's main Pokemon! (Pearl only has Palkia and Giratina and Diamond only has Dialga and Giratina)Platinum has 210 Pokemon to discover in the story mode!!! (Diamond and Pearl only has 150 Pokemon to discover in the story mode)Platinum has more better 3-d graphics then Diamond and Pearl.Platinum has more new places then Diamond and Pearl (the battleground for instance)Platinum has upgraded gyms!and much more!Platinum is "a better seqeul" to Diamond and Pearl so if you had to pick, Platinum is the answer!

A note: This review does NOT apply to Pokemon Emerald, Ruby and Sapphire's counterpart, since I have not played Pokemon Emerald.Ahh, Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire. By far some of the best games in Pokemon history so far. (Pokemon Firered in close second.)Longtime Pokemon fans with obviously enjoy this great game,(Like myself) and it will surely introduce many new fans to the series.You start out as either a male or female trainer. After a bit of talking, you discover that the town's local professor, Professor Birch, (Yes, as in a Birch tree) being cornered by a grumpy Poochyena. You grab one of the Pokemon from his bag, (A Treeko, grass type, Torchic, Fire type, or Mudkip, water type) And use it to defend the professor. That Pokemon will become your first ever Pokemon. And so, the adventure begins! (Geez, what a cliche'd line, lol.)Anyway, this game has many, many, (Insert the word 'many' a whole bunch of times ^-^) new features.First of all, a huge bundle of brand new Pokemon! And now, thanks to Pokemon Firered and leafgreen, you can get the 151 of the Kanto region in here too! Sadly, there are no new Pokemon Gold/Silver remakes...yet.Plus, there are Contests! Contests are special...well...contests, based on several categories, like Beauty, Tough, and Cute. Raise your pokemon to fit Contest form with Pokeblocks, a special candy that increases it's Coolness, Cuteness, Toughness, etc. Pokemon moves are also categorized. Such as, Bubble is a Cute move, and Brick Break is a Tough move, therefore, they can be used in their respective contests.There are also Natures, which can affect the way a Pokemon grows. Examples of Natures are: Relaxed, or Brave. Also, they affect the types of Pokeblocks a Pokemon likes.Abilities are another new feature. They are basically, special Pokemon abilities. Such as, the ability, Keen Eye. A Pokemon with the Keen Eye ability stops accuracy reduction in battle. Very, very useful!!Plus, a herd of new Pokemon moves! And, a bundle of new Pokeballs!The main Legendary Pokemon are Groudon, Kyogre, and Rayquaza. You can get Rayquaza in both games, but Groudon is only in Ruby, and Kyogre is only in Sapphire. But, if you own Pokemon Emerald, you can get all three!There are also even more Legendaries! Latios, Latias, Regirock, Registeel, Regice, Jirachi, and Deoxys.Well, that's pretty muhc all I'll tell you. I don't want to ruin any surprises. But, here are a few helpful tricks and tips:* As I have said in a Pokemon Firered reviews, DON'T Use all uber Legendaries. For one, no one will battle you, in fear of getting creamed, and second, it's not original. Nowadays, EVERYONE uses all Legendary teams in Official Competitons, and there's no variety, and no challenge to win. -_-; Not so 'Legendary' any more, huh?*CATCH SHINY POKEMON. Do I need to underline it? They are Pokemon colored differently than usual, and SUPER rare. I have not encountered one yet on my Ruby and Sapphire versions, but I have a Shiny Graveler on Firered. They are recognizable by a shimmery glow of stars around them, and their different colors. If you see one, CATCH IT!*Plant Berries! Currently, on Sapphire, I used up all the game's berries, and I can't plant many more. (I think I have the dreaded Berry Glitch) Berries are useful in battle, and are used to make Pokeblocks for Pokemon Contests.*This isn't really a tip...more of an evaluation. If you are a Newbie to Pokemon games, don't choose Torchic. It is weak to many Gym leaders, but is great for expierienced trainers. (I have a Blaziken, evolves form of Torchic, and let me tell you, it was touhg deafeatinbg Roxanne, a Rock type gym leader.) Treecko would be a better chocie, since it is strong against more Gym Leaders than the other two. Mudkip will be good for intermediate players.Well, that's all!
A note: This review does NOT apply to Pokemon Emerald, Ruby and Sapphire's counterpart, since I have not played Pokemon Emerald.Ahh, Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire. By far some of the best games in Pokemon history so far. (Pokemon Firered in close second.)Longtime Pokemon fans with obviously enjoy this great game,(Like myself) and it will surely introduce many new fans to the series.You start out as either a male or female trainer. After a bit of talking, you discover that the town's local professor, Professor Birch, (Yes, as in a Birch tree) being cornered by a grumpy Poochyena. You grab one of the Pokemon from his bag, (A Treeko, grass type, Torchic, Fire type, or Mudkip, water type) And use it to defend the professor. That Pokemon will become your first ever Pokemon. And so, the adventure begins! (Geez, what a cliche'd line, lol.)Anyway, this game has many, many, (Insert the word 'many' a whole bunch of times ^-^) new features.First of all, a huge bundle of brand new Pokemon! And now, thanks to Pokemon Firered and leafgreen, you can get the 151 of the Kanto region in here too! Sadly, there are no new Pokemon Gold/Silver remakes...yet.Plus, there are Contests! Contests are special...well...contests, based on several categories, like Beauty, Tough, and Cute. Raise your pokemon to fit Contest form with Pokeblocks, a special candy that increases it's Coolness, Cuteness, Toughness, etc. Pokemon moves are also categorized. Such as, Bubble is a Cute move, and Brick Break is a Tough move, therefore, they can be used in their respective contests.There are also Natures, which can affect the way a Pokemon grows. Examples of Natures are: Relaxed, or Brave. Also, they affect the types of Pokeblocks a Pokemon likes.Abilities are another new feature. They are basically, special Pokemon abilities.

The world of Pokemon took the world by strom when it was released.  Pokemon are animals with special powers.  Some people keep Pokemon as pets, but most people train thier pokemon for battle!  In a Pokemon battle, nobody dies, they just "faint" or knocked-out but not dead.  You can carry up to six pokemon in pokeballs.Pokemon Gold takes place in the Johto region, which is different from the Kanto (the old world in Pokemon Blue, Red and Yellow) region.  In this game, you can breed your own pokemon! Pokemon finally have Male and Female--the male pokemon are a little stronger than females.  A addictive game!

One word: PLAYBACK. My sister first owned this game in 1998, and since then I have owned MANY Pok&eacute;mon games for both Game Boy Color and N64. And let me tell you, the original is always the best! Pok&eacute;mon Red and Blue are the best games ever created for Game Boy Color! I still love these games, trading Pok&eacute;mon, and battling other people with the Link Cable!First of all, people of any age can enjoy this game. It is cute and innocent enough to entertain children, but the strategy and the level of gameplay make it a worthwhile game for adults. Everyone will love this game.You start out as a trainer named Ash Ketchum from Pallet Town. Your mission is to become a Pok&eacute;mon Master by catching 150 Pok&eacute;mon (151 if you count Mew) and becoming the champion of the Elite Four. To do this, you must train and catch Pok&eacute;mon, raise them, and even trade them between Red and Blue versions using your Link Cable or the infrared port on your Game Boy Color. This is both fun and time-consuming, which is great when you are at home sick or bored on a stormy day. Pok&eacute;mon are raised by winning battles and/or using Rare Candy. Raising Pok&eacute;mon may sound tedious, but you will change your mind about that when you actually play for yourself. Pok&eacute;mon is addictive from the moment you start your game all the way through. You will meet many new people on the way, become a hero, and win new items and abilities as you go along.As Ash, you travel through the world of Kanto, which is divided into a number of cities and towns. A map will be your guide as you make your way through the vast world of Pok&eacute;mon. Explore caves, oceans, tall grass, and rocky paths on your way. Each town or city usually has its own Pok&eacute;mon Gym, with a Gym Leader which is something like a Boss. Each time you beat a Gym Leader you receive a badge. You need eight badges to battle the Elite Four and the current Elite Four Champion. There are different diversions in each city and town, for example, Celadon City's department store and casino, and one of my personal favorites, Fuschia City's Safari Zone.Trainers can be found everywhere, good and bad, from Team Rocket invading the radio station, to the gyms, in the water, on the road, and pretty much anywhere you go. Random Pok&eacute;mon appear and battle you if you are in a cave, tall grass, or in the water. The wild Pok&eacute;mon you come across are the ones that you can catch if you have Pok&eacute;balls with you. Items such as the bike and repel can help prevent you from running into too many Pok&eacute;mon if you are trying to get somewhere. If your Pok&eacute;mon are tired or injured, you can stop at a Pok&eacute;mon center and heal them for free! You can also store Pok&eacute;mon via a computer terminal located within every Pok&eacute;mon Center.The music is so cute! And there is a lot of different music, so it doesn't get repetitive.If you are lucky enough to own Pok&eacute;mon Stadium, you can play Red or Blue on your TV screen using a Transfer Pak! You can also use the Pok&eacute;mon you raised on your Red or Blue game to battle in Pok&eacute;mon Stadium.Overall, this is one of the best games I have ever played. It is still fun after years of gameplay, as you never fully run out of stuff to do. If you want to get into Pok&eacute;mon, or if you're an old fan that never quite got around to getting the game, this is the game for you! Pok&eacute;maniacs rule!

I will always remember when I first learned that we got a SNES.  It was the summer of 1992.  Growing up in rural Oklahoma, my parents had a cow tank that we used for a swimming pool that we chlorinated.  I was in that tank all the time.  My father and my brother had gone to Oklahoma City (about an hour away from where we lived), and they had gotten an SNES, with "Super Mario World" prepackaged.  I immediately dried off, ran upstairs and my brother and I were immersed in Mario bliss.Being the Nintendo fans that we were, we were subscribers to Nintendo Power.  I poured over all the pre-cover of their latest [Nintendo] console, as well as any information we could glean of "Super Mario World".  I had even known some people who won the SNES in one of those give-aways they used to do back in the 1980s and 1990s on cereal boxes.  I was so jealous.Playing "Super Mario World" was a pure revelation that first time, and a perfect exhibition of the power of the SNES.  The graphics were gorgeous, the enemies were monstrous yet whimsical, and the Bullet Bills were enormous.There has always been a debate on which is better - "Super Mario Bros. 3" or "Super Mario World"..  For myself, I'd give the edge to "Super Mario World".  To be fair to "Super Mario Bros. 3", "Super Mario World" simply took the foundation laid by "SMB3" and perfected it, just like "The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past" did with the original "Legend of Zelda".Essentially, take everything great from "Super Mario Bros." and "Super Mario Bros. 3", expand the graphics and audio from 8-Bit to 16-Bit, overhaul the level lengths and add a ridable dinosaur named Yoshi, include a lot of secrets, and wa-la!, "Super Mario World"!Everything "Super Mario Bros. 3" is so adored for, "Super Mario World" takes and does several steps better, with only one exception - suits.  "Super Mario Bros. 3" famously introduced us to Racoon Mario, Hammer Mario, Frog Mario, and Tanooki Mario (though oddly no Boomerang Mario, which we wouldn't see until "Super Mario 3D Land").  "Super Mario World" only features Fire Mario and Cape Mario.  However, Cape Mario is able to fly for unlimited amounts of time, unlike Racoon Mario which is captive to a P-Meter and can only fly for short bursts.The story, always the same in the core Mario series, is simply that, while Mario, Luigi, and the Princess are on vacation to Dinasaur Land after the events of "SMB3", Bowser and his seven children kidnap seven dinasaur eggs and also abduct Princess Peach.  It is up to Mario to free the Princess and rescue the dinasaurs.  Don't worry though, the story's not important.  Mario is never about the story, it's always about the gameplay.  And what gameplay it is!"Super Mario World" is famous for introducing the world to Yoshi, the ridable dragon.  Miyamoto wanted Mario to ride a dinosaur in the original 1985 "Super Mario Bros.", but was not able to implement this new character until this game.  It is strange Yoshi doesn't appear in "Super Mario Bros. 3"; after all, ridable steeds appeared in "Adventure Island II" and also the later game "Little Nemo: Dream Master". [Regardless, you are given four types of Yoshis - the basic green one, the blue one [(who, when swallowing any type of turtle shell]]Regardless, you are given four types of Yoshi, each with a special power according to their colour: green, red, blue, and yellow.  The green is the most common.  Upon injesting a turtle shell, the red blows fire, the blue flies, and the yellow creates a dust storm attack.  The green is able to do all of these, if he swallows the same color turtle shell (red = fire, blue = flying, yellow = dust).  The special color yoshis are only available in secrect Star levels, where they appear as babies which Mario must feed five enemies for them to become full grown.Yoshi is also famous for eating.  Strangely enough, Mario must punch Yoshi in the back of the head before Yoshi sticks out his tongue, looking for goodies.One of my favorite additions is just how Miyamota and company added to the lenght.  One legitimate weakness of "SMB3" is simply how short so many of the levels are - many times, you complete the level just when you feel you are about halfway done.  Even Miyamoto commented on this on one of the reissues of "Super Mario Bros. 3", asking his developers if the game's original levels were really that short.  Once a level is beaten, you cannot go back.  No so with "Super Mario World". Indeed, due to the secret exits and alternate paths, Nintendo encourages you to go back and explore levels already beaten, and the levels themselves are consistently much longer than those found in "SMB3".Taking the overworld map first introduced in "SMB3", for the first (and, until the 2012 "New Super Mario Bros. U", only) time on a home console Mario game, the map is connected and completely visible, unlike its predecessor.  Previously, the worlds were divided into individual maps, but not "Super Mario World".  From the get go, you could view the entire game map.  Dinasaur Land comprises seven different areas, played in this order: Yoshi's Island, guarded by Iggy Koopa; Donut Plains, guarded by Morton Koopa Jr., Vanilla Dome, guarded by Lemmy Koopa, Twin Bridges, guarded by Luwig von Koopa; the Forest of Illusion, guarded by Roy Koopa; Chocolate Island, guarded by Wendy O. Koopa; and the Valley of Bowser, home to not only Bowser but Larry Koopa as well.You cannot underestimate how the world map truly effected gameplay.  For the first time on a significant level, you could choose your own path.  The map also afforded the game developers the opportunity to made the game chock-full of secrets, alternate paths, and hidden areas.  The secrets were not so esoterically hidden to be inaccessible to the average player either - if a regular level had a secret exit, the level would be a red dot; if no secret exit existed, then the level is represented as a yellow dot.Each world is thematically diverse.  The first world features basic levels that ease the player into the gameplay, teaching you the rules and dynamics of Mario's new adventure.  The second world is set in the plains, the third world is set in caverns, and the fourth world is set on dual bridges, along with some mountain levels.By the fifth world, the Forest of Illusion, the challenge has been ramped up, and to proceed you MUST find those deviously hidden secret exits.  We then have the "tasty (but dangerous!)" Chocolate Island, which also features a level that how fast you beat individual sections determines what the next segment of that level will be.  Then we have the challenging Ghost Ship (which, according to the instruction manual, is a wrecked ship from "Super Mario Bros. 3"), and the only boss level that Yoshi will enter. After that, naturally, is the Valley of Bowser.One of the best features are the two secret worlds - the Star World and the Secret World.  Unlike other Mario games, there are no warp zones present in "Super Mario World". However, there are levels called the Star Road, which enable you to get to different parts of the map quickly and effectively by accessing the Star World and completing the levels.  To connect the Star Road, you must find the secret exits.  Once you find the fifth and final level on the Star Road, you are then taken to the Secret World, a world of eight gruelling, ultra-challenging levels that will truly test your Mario metal."Super Mario Bros. 4: Super Mario World" (the official Japanese title) is the best 2D Mario out there, though perhaps "New Super Mario Bros. U" will usurp this game from its lofty throne.Interestingly enough, Miyamoto has said that he was not entirely happy with "Super Mario World", as he felt the game had been rushed to publication and not completed to his exacting standards.  However, just like "Mega Man 3" (a game also apparently rushed), "Super Mario World" is as good as it gets.  I wonder what further changes Miyamoto would have made.  Unfortunately we'll never know.Those who love masterpieces of excellent 2D platforming action would be amiss without this purchase for their SNES - and better yet, "Super Mario World" is also available on the Wii and Wii U's Virtual Console.  Pick this one up!  You won't regret it...-----[This was written separate from the review back in May 2012 about the Mario games' development history.  Notably, Miyamoto said that "Super Mario World" began development with a team of sixteen people, and took about three years to make.  As "Super Mario World" came out in November 1990, that means Nintendo began production on this game sometime in 1987 - the same year they were working on "Super Mario Bros. 3".  On a game forum someone asked why Nintendo did not release "Super Mario Bros. 3" on the SNES, instead of the NES, and was complaining they should have released the game on the more powerful system.  This was my answer:]Let's look at some Mario history, shall we?  SMB3 came out in Japan in October 1988. That means it was completed, finished, and ready to be published by that point in time.If you look at the Japanese publication dates, SMB came out in 1985, Lost Levels came out in 1986, Doki Doki Panic came out in 1987, and SMB3 came out in late 1988. Given the fact the game was finished and released by 1988 I would hardly call that "late in the NES hardware cycle". Actually, the NES had only been out three years when SMB3 hit Japan, although the Famicom came out in late 1983. However all the heavy hitters for the Famicom came out in 1985 and beyond.Essentially all Nintendo had to do at this point was release it on cart; the code was written and completed. If have a sequel to the biggest game for your console, and the sequel SMB2 is also a massive hit - why wouldn't they release SMB3 which was already completed and published in Japan? They had a massive financial interest in getting this game out.There are very few differences between the Japanese SMB3 and the western SMB3 (namely if Mario gets hit with a powerup he goes to little Mario rather than Super Mario, ala Mario with a mushroom). There's nothing like the major differences between the Japanese and the Western versions of Zelda II The Adventure of Link.All four 8-bit NES titles were completed in a three year period, 1985-1988 (and were published in Japan as well, though SMB2, there called SMB USA, came out in 1992).I've read SMB3 took about two to three years to program, meaning Nintendo began work on it possibly by late 1985 (though that does sound entirely too early) but definitely by early 1987 and possibly even late 1986 given it was released in October 1988 and both Doki Doki and Lost Levels would have been finished (in the case of Doki Doki, it would have been closed to being completed if not already completed).In comparison today, that would be like saying Nintendo should not have released "New Super Mario Bros. Wii" back in 2009 (three years into the Wii lifecycle) because obviously the Wii U is coming up and they should save it for a new system. The timeframe is the same. And according to your logic, for this generation we definitely SHOULD NOT have gotten Skyward Sword for the Wii, despite the fact it has had a five year development timeframe was began shortly after Twilight Princess came out..I do find it strange that they had problems with Yoshi (which for the record Miyamoto has said he wanted to put in the original 1985 SMB). After all, Hudson's Adventure Island series, the same company responsible for the abomination that is Super Mario Bros. Special, the first ever sequel to the Mario franchise, were able to get ridable dinasaurs, and the 1993 Capcom title Little Nemo Dream Master had ridable creatures too.Then again, Adventure Island II came out in April 1991, two and a half years after SMB3.Basically, I said all that to say you should research your Mario history more. When Nintendo began development on SMB3 (late 1986/early 1987) the Super NES was nowhere on the horizon, at least not publically. Even in late 1988 when the game was published, we were still over two years away from the Super Famicom which came out in Japan in November of 1990.So that's why they didn't develop it for the Super Famicom.

Actually, the NES had only been out three years when SMB3 hit Japan, although the Famicom came out in late 1983. However all the heavy hitters for the Famicom came out in 1985 and beyond.Essentially all Nintendo had to do at this point was release it on cart; the code was written and completed. If have a sequel to the biggest game for your console, and the sequel SMB2 is also a massive hit - why wouldn't they release SMB3 which was already completed and published in Japan? They had a massive financial interest in getting this game out.There are very few differences between the Japanese SMB3 and the western SMB3 (namely if Mario gets hit with a powerup he goes to little Mario rather than Super Mario, ala Mario with a mushroom). There's nothing like the major differences between the Japanese and the Western versions of Zelda II The Adventure of Link.All four 8-bit NES titles were completed in a three year period, 1985-1988 (and were published in Japan as well, though SMB2, there called SMB USA, came out in 1992).I've read SMB3 took about two to three years to program, meaning Nintendo began work on it possibly by late 1985 (though that does sound entirely too early) but definitely by early 1987 and possibly even late 1986 given it was released in October 1988 and both Doki Doki and Lost Levels would have been finished (in the case of Doki Doki, it would have been closed to being completed if not already completed).In comparison today, that would be like saying Nintendo should not have released "New Super Mario Bros. Wii" back in 2009 (three years into the Wii lifecycle) because obviously the Wii U is coming up and they should save it for a new system. The timeframe is the same. And according to your logic, for this generation we definitely SHOULD NOT have gotten Skyward Sword for the Wii, despite the fact it has had a five year development timeframe was began shortly after Twilight Princess came out..I do find it strange that they had problems with Yoshi (which for the record Miyamoto has said he wanted to put in the original 1985 SMB). After all, Hudson's Adventure Island series, the same company responsible for the abomination that is Super Mario Bros. Special, the first ever sequel to the Mario franchise, were able to get ridable dinasaurs, and the 1993 Capcom title Little Nemo Dream Master had ridable creatures too.Then again, Adventure Island II came out in April 1991, two and a half years after SMB3.Basically, I said all that to say you should research your Mario history more. When Nintendo began development on SMB3 (late 1986/early 1987) the Super NES was nowhere on the horizon, at least not publically. Even in late 1988 when the game was published, we were still over two years away from the Super Famicom which came out in Japan in November of 1990.So that's why they didn't develop it for the Super Famicom.

SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 3, one of the most famous games Nintendo has ever produced, came out toward in the middle of the NES console's life cycle, and brought renewed life to the aging console.  Like the original Super Mario Brothers, SMB3 became one of the biggest selling games ever.  SMB3 also brought a lot of new innovations to the Mario series, many of which can still be found today.  SMB3 regularly charts both player and critic polls as being among the best video games ever released.Released [in at the end of 1988] October 3, 1988 in Japan, SMB3 became one the Famicon's biggest sellers.  America had to wait for over a year from when Japan got it.  Originally released in some Nintendo arcade machines before it even hit stores, the buzz soon spread about the game.  This buzz was helped by the ninety minute commercial known as THE WIZARD (some people insist that it is a movie proper, but it's little more than a Nintendo advertisement) in which the climax of the movie - er, commercial - is the unveiling of SMB3, as well as revealing the secret location to the one of the warp whistles.  America finally got its hands on the game in released February 12, 1990.The game went on to sell approx. eighteen million copies, and when you include the reissues and rereleases with SUPER MARIO ALL STARS and SUPER MARIO ADVANCED, this figure swells to over thirty three million copies.  And what makes SMB3 such a successful, highly regarded title?  Read on.For the second* officially released sequel to the biggest selling game of all time, Nintendo didn't pull any stops when it came to crafting this game.  Returning to the familiar environments and gameplay of the original title, rather than the radical reinvention of SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 2, Nintendo greatly widened Mario's moves and gamestyle.  The Fire-flower and starman return.  Nintendo introduces Mario's famous raccoon suit, which enables Mario to fly briefly, and greatly opens up what is possible in level design.  New suits and powerups also include the Tanooki suit, which enables Mario to become a stone statue, a Frog suit for swimming, and Hammer Brothers suit, which enables Mario to shoot hammers.One of the biggest innovations was the inclusion of an overall game map, where Mario would move between levels.  Nintendo also used the concept (in a much different setting with a much different effect) in ZELDA II: THE ADVENTURE OF LINK, though in that title the overworld was much more important and you had a lot more freedom.  Here, the map served as a level grid in which to progress through the eight worlds.  SMB3 returns to the eight world format of the original game, rather than the seven world format of SMB2.The level design itself is where SMB3 truly shines.  First off, Nintendo returned to the original game for its basic game mechanics but [induing] ensuring Mario has a whole new bag of tricks to beat the nasty Bowser and his koopa kids.  While staying true to the overall atmosphere and play of the original title, Nintendo, over the course of eight worlds, features platforming levels that ingeniously use the game's new suits and powerups to fully integrate the player into the game's world.  Each of the eight levels is themed.  The first world is grass lands.  The second world is desert (much like the second and sixth world in SMB2).  The third is the water levels.  Where the castle is on the overworld map for World 3 is roughly a map of Japan and Tokyo.  The fourth world is the land of giants.  The fifth is the Skylands.  The sixth is frozen tundra, all ice.  The seventh is Pipeland, and the eight is Bowser's world, featuring lava, tricky airships, and challenging levels.SMB3 also introduces the seven children of King Kooper (whose the mother???), each of which rule one of the worlds and which at the end of each world you must fight in an airship.  Other innovations include minigames, new enemies (many of which would feature prominently in later titles), and the aforementioned suits.A good portion of NES games are notorious for being extremely difficult.  Some titles are damn near impossible (BATTLE TOADS, NINJA GAIDEN III), and others are filled with cheap shots and just unforgiving, unreasonable difficulty (the original MEGA MAN).  In fact, the original sequel to SUPER MARIO BROTHERS (known everywhere but Japan as THE LOST LEVELS) went unreleased in its original format stateside or in Europe for twenty one years due to difficulty and too similar to the original game.  We only just now got the title via the Virtual Console on the Wii.Fortunately, SMB3 has a very intuitive difficulty level.  As each world progresses, so does the difficulty of the levels, which culminates in the last world of Bowser, which does have some hard patches.  Overall, however, SMB3 has a medium range of difficulty, and while there are some tricky parts here and there, the game is not really that difficult and most players will be able to beat it given enough time.  Not giving too much away, SMB3 also jokingly refers to the original title after you beat Bowser, with the first words out of Princess Toadstool's mouth is "Thank you Mario, but our princess is in another castle . . . just kidding."  Strangely enough, they cut this joke in the SUPER MARIO ADVANCED reissue.Overall, SMB3 stands as one of the gaming industry's most outstanding achievements, and is one of the corner stones of the Mario Series.  As much as I love SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 2, SMB3 really felt like the true sequel to the original game, and Mario went out with a blaze of glory on the original NES with this title.  One of the greatest games ever.*Though this is the second sequel to be released and that the general public knew about, this was actually the fourth officially licensed sequel to SUPER MARIO BROTHERS.  The first, developed by Hudson Soft with Nintendo's permission, was a game called SUPER MARIO BROTHERS SPECIAL, which appeared on the obscure NEC PC-8801 in Japan only.  This is the truly forgotten Mario game, the real lost levels if you will.  Due to technical limitations, it does not scroll and the hit detection is rather off.  Nintendo had nothing to do with its development.  The second sequel is SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 2, released in 1986.  This title was released only in Japan.  The game was just like SUPER MARIO BROTHERS, but much harder.  Howard Lincoln of HOWARD AND NESTOR fame (anyone who had Nintendo Power back in the 1980s knows what I am talking about) hated the title, so they took a Japanese game called Doki Doki Panic, changed some sprites, and in 1988 released the American version of SUPER MARIO  BROTHERS 2.------------------.-----[This was written separate from the review back in May 2012 about the Mario games' development history. Notably, Miyamoto said that "Super Mario World" began development with a team of sixteen people, and took about three years to make.

The Gameboy Advance is unique in the Nintendo catalogue as being a system without an original Mario title.  Barring the abysmal failure of the Virtual Boy, the lack of a Mario title has never occurred before or since.  Much like a person without a country, a Nintendo without a Mario just feels adrift and cut off from the rest of the gaming universe and real time gamer economy.Of course, one could argue that Mario IS Nintendo.  To remedy the lack of Mario, instead of developing an original game, instead Nintendo elected to issue the "Super  Mario Advance" series, which are simply remakes of pre-existing Mario side scrollers.  There were four total.  Although disappointing that we never got a real Mario game for the Gameboy Advance, the Advance series holds its own as great portable Mario fun, although this strength is primaly found in the original games themselves.Although probably not a concern now, years after the fact, if you have a Gameboy Advance and you are looking to purchase one of the Mario Advance titles, you may be better served with one of the other, longer games.  If you are not familiar with "Super Mario Bros. 2", the game is twenty levels long, and can easily be beaten within an hour if you are speed-running or even if you are taking your time.  If you want longer play time then I would probably go with "Super Mario Advance 2: Super Mario World".However, for those who love the Mario series and "Super Mario Bros. 2" in particular, this is a fine remake, even with all the changes from the original game.  Given the age of this remake, unless you want to experiences the changes for yourself, you may be better served picking  "Super Mario Bros. 2" up in some other regard, such as a digital form or the 2010 "Super Mario All-Stars" remake for the Wii.Beware of one change.  The voices.  Oh God, the voices.  They are horrendous.  All four have been given voice acting.  These sayings get grating, to say the least.  Almost to the point where you want to play the game without audio, it's that bad."Super Mario Bros. 2", for those unfamiliar with the game, is the most drastically different of the four 8-bit Mario titles.  Mario defeats enemies by  picking either them or vegetables up and throwing said enemy/random vegetable at other enemies.  The story is that an big green final boss named Wart has taken over the World of Dreams (called Sub Con), kidnapped the citizens of Sub-con, and has taken over and styled himself as king.  It is up to Mario, Luigi, Toad, and Princess Toadstool to overthrow Wart and restore order.  There are seven worlds total, with three levels per piece and the final world having two levels, for a total of twenty.The enemy roster for "Super Mario Bros. 2" were almost exclusively limited to this game in the first few years after its release, with only Bob-Ombs appearing in the follow-up, "Super Mario Bros. 3", and Ninjis appearing in one level of the SNES "Super Mario World".  However, in subsequent years, enemies from "Super Mario Bros. 2" have become main-stays in the Mario universe and also appear in numerous spin-off titles.  Notably, however, the four bosses, Mouser, Tryclyde, Fryguy, Clawgrip, and the big baddie Wart have never been seen or heard from since.  Unlike Fawful from the RPG series, Wart is not very distinguishable from Bowser - they're both big, green reptiles.  Still, I would love to see a return of Wart and the other bosses!Strangely enough to some (Gamespot in particular), Nintendo's ingaural release in the "Advance" series is a remake of "Super Mario Bros 2" from 1988.  Yes, pretty much everyone who is a fan of Mario and Nintendo know SMB2 was originally released in Japan as a Famicom Disk System title called "Yume Kojo: Doki Doki Panic" and originally featured non-Mario characters; it has since been revealed by Nintendo that "Doki Doki Panic" actually began development explicitly as a sequel to the original "Super Mario Bros.", even before "The Lost Levels", but they were having issues with the prototype and ultimately released "The Lost Levels" as the followup.  However, Miyamoto and company always intended "Doki Doki Panic" as a Mario title.  Miyamoto has even stated in E3 2012 that, next to the original, "Super Mario Bros. 2" is his favorite Mario game.  High praise indeed.That being said, how does "Super Mario Advance" stack up as a remake?  Well, those looking for a straight port will be disappointed - "Super Mario Advance" contains the most changes to the original game of all four "Advance" games.  We will get into the changes momentarily.First off, you should know the game is based heavily off the version of "Super Mario Bros. 2" found on "Super Mario All-Stars".  Although gameplay was untouched in "Super Mario All-stars", all four games ("SMB", "Lost Levels", "SMB2", and "SMB3) were given extensive graphical and audio upgrades, with "SMB2" being the most drastic.  Nintendo has taken these upgrades several steps further, touching gameplay in addition to the cosmetics.Like "Super Mario All-Stars", the original NES title is not included.  I wish they had included the original as an unlockable, like they did with "Metroid - Zero Mission" and the original "Metroid".  Although now available on the Wii and Wii U Virtual Console, at the time of this game's release that was still several years away.  The only way to play the original NES title in 2001 was either an emulator or a working NES.Here are the following changes:-In a precursor to Comet and Star Coins found in all "Super Mario" titles between 2006-2012, there are five Ace Coins hidden throughout each level, which, when collected, put a star on the level map and yield a 1-up-Player begins with only one heart, as opposed to the original two hearts.  An extra mushroom appears in every level, taking the total heart count from four to five.-Hearts (which restore health) appear much more often than in the original.  Hearts can also be pulled up from the earth and are called Heart-Radishes.-The intro to World 1-1 has been redesigned, including a giant Shyguy and a hill that bounces the player when stood upon-The jar interiors feature new music tracks and have been completely redesigned, featuring Shyguys riding Ferris Wheels.-Some 1-Ups have been moved from their original locations.  Others are encased in bubbles sitting on the ground, which the player must throw three items to break the bubble and obtain the 1-up.-The game now strangely features points like the original "Super Mario Bros.".  If you get enough points by hitting multiple enemies with a single vegetable you are awarded an additional 1-up.-Giant vegetables, enemies, and POW blocks are now present.  Carrots have also been added as a new vegetable platform, but only appear in two levels, and the Red Shells are much larger.-After defeating Wart, two Yoshi eggs appear in Sub-Con in all twenty levels.  Just like Pokemon, you gotta catch `em all!There are also numerous aesthetic changes as well.The biggest change of them all (at least in my estimation) is a brand new boss called "Robobirdo".  A robotic version of Birdo, this boss is a giant machine that now acts as the final guardian of World 3, replacing Mouser.  As of 2012, "Super Mario Advance" is the only appearance Robirdo has made in a Mario game.This new boss is easily the best addition/deviation from the original game.  Notably, the original second Mouser Battle that originally ended World 3 has been shuffled to World Six, replacing Tryclyde.  As a result, Mouser still appears twice (just like the original NES "Super Mario Bros 2") and Tryclyde has been reduced to only one boss battle, which occurs in World 2.In retrospect, "Super Mario Bros. 2" does feel as a somewhat strange choice as a launch Mario title for the Gameboy Advance in 2001; however, the game proved to be a best seller and a Player's Choice as well.  If you love Mario then I highly recommend you get this.  You will greatly enjoy yourself.  For those few gamers who are considering investing in the Advance series and HAVE NOT PLAYED "Super Mario Bros. 2" in any of its vast incarnations, most likely you will find the game entertaining as well, if a tad different from the "traditional Mario formula".

To remedy the lack of Mario, instead of developing an original game, instead Nintendo elected to issue the "Super  Mario Advance" series, which are simply remakes of pre-existing Mario side scrollers.  There were four total.  Although disappointing that we never got a real Mario game for the Gameboy Advance, the Advance series holds its own as great portable Mario fun, although this strength is primaly found in the original games themselves.Although probably not a concern now, years after the fact, if you have a Gameboy Advance and you are looking to purchase one of the Mario Advance titles, you may be better served with one of the other, longer games.  If you are not familiar with "Super Mario Bros. 2", the game is twenty levels long, and can easily be beaten within an hour if you are speed-running or even if you are taking your time.  If you want longer play time then I would probably go with "Super Mario Advance 2: Super Mario World".However, for those who love the Mario series and "Super Mario Bros. 2" in particular, this is a fine remake, even with all the changes from the original game.  Given the age of this remake, unless you want to experiences the changes for yourself, you may be better served picking  "Super Mario Bros. 2" up in some other regard, such as a digital form or the 2010 "Super Mario All-Stars" remake for the Wii.Beware of one change.  The voices.  Oh God, the voices.  They are horrendous.  All four have been given voice acting.  These sayings get grating, to say the least.  Almost to the point where you want to play the game without audio, it's that bad."Super Mario Bros. 2", for those unfamiliar with the game, is the most drastically different of the four 8-bit Mario titles.  Mario defeats enemies by  picking either them or vegetables up and throwing said enemy/random vegetable at other enemies.  The story is that an big green final boss named Wart has taken over the World of Dreams (called Sub Con), kidnapped the citizens of Sub-con, and has taken over and styled himself as king.  It is up to Mario, Luigi, Toad, and Princess Toadstool to overthrow Wart and restore order.  There are seven worlds total, with three levels per piece and the final world having two levels, for a total of twenty.The enemy roster for "Super Mario Bros. 2" were almost exclusively limited to this game in the first few years after its release, with only Bob-Ombs appearing in the follow-up, "Super Mario Bros. 3", and Ninjis appearing in one level of the SNES "Super Mario World".  However, in subsequent years, enemies from "Super Mario Bros. 2" have become main-stays in the Mario universe and also appear in numerous spin-off titles.  Notably, however, the four bosses, Mouser, Tryclyde, Fryguy, Clawgrip, and the big baddie Wart have never been seen or heard from since.  Unlike Fawful from the RPG series, Wart is not very distinguishable from Bowser - they're both big, green reptiles.  Still, I would love to see a return of Wart and the other bosses!Strangely enough to some (Gamespot in particular), Nintendo's ingaural release in the "Advance" series is a remake of "Super Mario Bros 2" from 1988.  Yes, pretty much everyone who is a fan of Mario and Nintendo know SMB2 was originally released in Japan as a Famicom Disk System title called "Yume Kojo: Doki Doki Panic" and originally featured non-Mario characters; it has since been revealed by Nintendo that "Doki Doki Panic" actually began development explicitly as a sequel to the original "Super Mario Bros.", even before "The Lost Levels", but they were having issues with the prototype and ultimately released "The Lost Levels" as the followup.  However, Miyamoto and company always intended "Doki Doki Panic" as a Mario title.  Miyamoto has even stated in E3 2012 that, next to the original, "Super Mario Bros. 2" is his favorite Mario game.  High praise indeed.That being said, how does "Super Mario Advance" stack up as a remake?  Well, those looking for a straight port will be disappointed - "Super Mario Advance" contains the most changes to the original game of all four "Advance" games.  We will get into the changes momentarily.First off, you should know the game is based heavily off the version of "Super Mario Bros. 2" found on "Super Mario All-Stars".  Although gameplay was untouched in "Super Mario All-stars", all four games ("SMB", "Lost Levels", "SMB2", and "SMB3) were given extensive graphical and audio upgrades, with "SMB2" being the most drastic.  Nintendo has taken these upgrades several steps further, touching gameplay in addition to the cosmetics.Like "Super Mario All-Stars", the original NES title is not included.  I wish they had included the original as an unlockable, like they did with "Metroid - Zero Mission" and the original "Metroid".  Although now available on the Wii and Wii U Virtual Console, at the time of this game's release that was still several years away.  The only way to play the original NES title in 2001 was either an emulator or a working NES.Here are the following changes:-In a precursor to Comet and Star Coins found in all "Super Mario" titles between 2006-2012, there are five Ace Coins hidden throughout each level, which, when collected, put a star on the level map and yield a 1-up-Player begins with only one heart, as opposed to the original two hearts.  An extra mushroom appears in every level, taking the total heart count from four to five.-Hearts (which restore health) appear much more often than in the original.  Hearts can also be pulled up from the earth and are called Heart-Radishes.-The intro to World 1-1 has been redesigned, including a giant Shyguy and a hill that bounces the player when stood upon-The jar interiors feature new music tracks and have been completely redesigned, featuring Shyguys riding Ferris Wheels.-Some 1-Ups have been moved from their original locations.  Others are encased in bubbles sitting on the ground, which the player must throw three items to break the bubble and obtain the 1-up.-The game now strangely features points like the original "Super Mario Bros.".  If you get enough points by hitting multiple enemies with a single vegetable you are awarded an additional 1-up.-Giant vegetables, enemies, and POW blocks are now present.  Carrots have also been added as a new vegetable platform, but only appear in two levels, and the Red Shells are much larger.-After defeating Wart, two Yoshi eggs appear in Sub-Con in all twenty levels.  Just like Pokemon, you gotta catch `em all!There are also numerous aesthetic changes as well.The biggest change of them all (at least in my estimation) is a brand new boss called "Robobirdo".  A robotic version of Birdo, this boss is a giant machine that now acts as the final guardian of World 3, replacing Mouser.  As of 2012, "Super Mario Advance" is the only appearance Robirdo has made in a Mario game.This new boss is easily the best addition/deviation from the original game.  Notably, the original second Mouser Battle that originally ended World 3 has been shuffled to World Six, replacing Tryclyde.  As a result, Mouser still appears twice (just like the original NES "Super Mario Bros 2") and Tryclyde has been reduced to only one boss battle, which occurs in World 2.In retrospect, "Super Mario Bros. 2" does feel as a somewhat strange choice as a launch Mario title for the Gameboy Advance in 2001; however, the game proved to be a best seller and a Player's Choice as well.  If you love Mario then I highly recommend you get this.  You will greatly enjoy yourself.  For those few gamers who are considering investing in the Advance series and HAVE NOT PLAYED "Super Mario Bros. 2" in any of its vast incarnations, most likely you will find the game entertaining as well, if a tad different from the "traditional Mario formula".
This game claims to be the sequel to Super Mario World, though the two are very different. Both are Mario platforming titles, but Yoshi's Island is played a little differently. Baby Luigi has been kidnapped and it's up to his brother Mario and his Yoshi friends to save him from Kamek and Baby Bowser. Play as Yoshi and defeat enemies by turning them into eggs and throwing the eggs. Find and collect all 20 red coins, 5 flowers, and 30 stars to get a perfect score. Transform into lots of different vehicles to get past dangerous obsticles. Yoshi's Island is fun for all ages!

Unlike the N64, you need a memory card for all of the games. This card, although the norm for GCN, is really small, at half a megabyte. A floppy disk has about 1.5MB for comparison. However, there are some other options. One is the 8MB memory card from Interact, but I am not to sure on the reliablity of it. However, the Big ONE is the Panasonic SD (secure digital) memory cards availble at the Panasonic web site. They are super reliable and range in size from 16-64 MB (now,bigger ones are coming soon) (...). That's a lot of moola for a single card, but that's big; you can store 8 whole entire Mario 64 cartriges on one stick!!! My advice: get this and expect to buy a whole lot more, or just buy one SD card for every single game you ever get.

Nintendo's reaction towards Conker's Bad Fur Day is a bit ambiguous. Conker's Bad Fur Day made headlines among the gaming industry when advertisements for this game appeared in Playboy and Maxim. I mean, this is a Nintendo 64 game! However, Nintendo had completely denied the game's existence in anything where people 17 or younger could access. Is it really that much worse than, say, Shadow Man or South Park 64, both of which received ample coverage from Nintendo Power and yet both of which had foul language and violence up the wazoo? It is hard to say (especially considering that I have barely played Shadow Man or South Park 64). Still, everybody I know that hates this game hates it not for its gameplay, but just the fact that the mad scientists in Twycross turned Conker from a cuddly, high-pitched squirrel with bland textures to a gruff squirrel with a penchant for beer, breasts, and 'bacco. (Accusations have been made that Conker had become rather foul-mouthed himself, but with only two swear words I know of, Conker's language is much tamer than those around him.) Still, CBFD is a welcome respite from the Rare platforming formula of collection and cute characters (you've got some darned ugly things in Conker's Bad Fur Day)...and when only one word that would have been censored from NSider was spoken.Conker's Bad Fur Day is a linear adventure game, where the completion of tasks in one area allows you to progress further into an adventure. You know...kind of like Ocarina of Time! Except in CBFD, A is your jump button, and B is the context sensitive button. With Ocarina of Time, the purpose of the context sensitive A button changes depending on the context, B in CBFD usually access the frying pan. The context only changes in the presence of a B-button pad or when a light bulb appears. This does kind of make the game feel forced, as if Rare is saying, "Roar! This is what you have do at this time! There's nothing you can do to change it!" Still, the levels and the situations have enough variety where you do not feel bogged down. The single-player mode is pretty short, but it is fun, funny, and full of strange situations that feel more like different episodes instead of a coherent, linear plot. It is strange to go from fighting a boss battle against a mound of anthropomorphic feces to a prehistoric world. But alas, such is the situation poor Conker must go through. Gameplay is also as varied as the storyline. While most of the game is platforming, there are times when the game switches to a Jet-Force-Geminiesque 3rd person shooter or a twisted racing game. Independent of the single-player adventure is the game's multiplayer mode. The multiplayer mode is as fun and incoherent as the single-player mode. You can race on hoverboards, escape the wrath of the Tediz as unarmed civilians, or go at it in several types of free-for-all deathmatches. Some modes are stale, but others are delicious and can provide hours of entertainment.Even without the Expansion Pak, Conker's Bad Fur Day is one of the best games for the Nintendo 64 visually and aurally. By 2001, Rare had already established themselves as being very ambitious with graphics (so much as to cause severe slowdown, but that doesn't appear very often in CBFD), and Conker's Bad Fur Day is one of their best efforts. Everything has such wonderful textures, and even though some of the flowers and stuff are obviously sprites, they aren't as bad as in some other games. Rare has gone on to give Conker lip synching even more accurate than those found in Dreamcast's Shenmue, although everybody else move their lips in a way that resemble the animal characters in Mononoke Hime. Voice acting in Conker's Bad Fur Day tops Perfect Dark and Star Fox 64 to become the best on the Nintendo 64. This is perhaps aided by some of the best writing ever to appear in a N64 game. Virtually every line is quotable, especially the Great Mighty Poo song. Sound effects are truly awesome, but it definitely does not hold a candle to the game's music. Conker's Bad Fur Day has some of the best music of all time. The songs are amazingly catchy, and well-done. And when was the last time a piece of music had farts as part of the melody? If games were ranked on a technical scale, then Conker's Bad Fur Day would definitely be near the top.

Conker's Bad Fur Day is the kid's game that browsed the adult section and then loaded itself on Daddy's private stash. BFD has its crosshairs directly aimed at the college audience, and it works perfectly for the peeps who've grown up with Mario and are now looking for someone less dorky. That is, in between frat parties and other immoral activities.Looking past the hype surrounding the first truly 'adult' Nintendo game, BFD makes you chuckle and drives you to keep playing. I would have liked some deeper action or at least a longer experience, but this is still certainly worth the investment. Now where did I put that Bloody Mary mix?

What a great , great game- maybe overlooked a bit as it was released in the very twilight of the N64 days. The multiplayer aspect, which was already incredibly advanced on the N64, is going to fit in very well on the forthcoming Xbox version with Xbox Live. But it's the single player that always makes a game for me. The world that Conker inhabits is a bit like an 'adult' Alice in Wonderland, taking so many great twists and turns without ever seeming disjointed. There is a wonderful compactness to the game - there is never a sense that any space has been wasted- no interminable treks along featureless corridors- unlike Starfox Adventures, Rare's next console game.Yet the game manages to provide a sense of scale typical of the greatest adventures- at one point you can look down at the great expanse below from the edge of a diving board.This game was the last of a string of fine platformers on the N64 and my favourite- more so than the unforgiving Mario 64.An integral part of the game is undoubtedly the humour- regional accents aplenty swearing like troopers long before Ozzy Osbourne made it fashionable. Talking to a Conker character is like putting the world to rights over a pint in the pub- it's very refreshing to see it in a videogame and very British. Some conservative reviewers have failed to grasp that the bawdiness is no shallow gimickry but an integral part of what is a very polished, well put together adventure game. The cutscenes (such as the famous Great Mighty Poo) add an infinite amount to the character of the game. The graphical design of the levels and characters is wonderful- a rich cartoon world has been created.  Puking, swearing, busty maidens, beer, singing s***- it's a right rich stew of brilliance. And it is probably the best 'last game ever made for a console' ever. To be honest, it's up there with my favourite games ever.

This game refined the gameplay of SM, but not that much. What were they thinking with the crappy 2-arm ledge grab?! Fortunately they fixed that in ZM. Storywise this game is awesome, concluding that of Other M nicely. The biggest shocker is the ending. SamusxAdam FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!

I must say, after 10 years that this game STILL holds up well, especially for the GameCube.  When it originally came out, I played a demo of it at Target and was amazed at the gameplay, wonderful animations and graphics of this game.  This great game has awesome gameplay in simulation and arcade mode, which the latter stands out in the game, where you can choose a team and three superstars in an outdoor beach court.  This game is the best in the Courtside series and would highly recommend this game for GameCube owners who are basketball fans. Also, I would recommend to those who are reminiscent of the rosters of this game - Shaq and Kobe on the Lakers, AI on the Sixers, Antoine Walker and Paul Pierce on the Celtics, J. Kidd and Kenyon Martin on NJ, Baron Davis on the Charlotte Hornets, etc.

She's the only one who will give you important information on where the ham-hams were headed to and the boss enemies you'll have to fight against.  Once those objectives are fulfilled, you'll have to fight against Spat, who will be the final boss enemy in the title.  Good luck!How to play:  Your team is consisted of 2 ham-hams.  They're known as Hamtaro and Bijou, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  Sometimes you have to use teamwork, and sometimes you'll have to split up to solve the puzzles throughout the game.  Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find all the ham-hams while solving those hair-raising mysteries and dueling your enemies.  The title also contains new twists and turns around every corner.  Good luck, and grab this title while you can, because they're going fast.

She's the only one who will give you important information on where the ham-hams were headed to and the boss enemies you'll have to fight against.  Once those objectives are fulfilled, you'll have to fight against Spat, who will be the final boss enemy in the title.  Good luck!How to play:  Your team is consisted of 2 ham-hams.  They're known as Hamtaro and Bijou, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  Sometimes you have to use teamwork, and sometimes you'll have to split up to solve the puzzles throughout the game.  Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find all the ham-hams while solving those hair-raising mysteries and dueling your enemies.  The title also contains new twists and turns around every corner.  Good luck, and grab this title while you can, because they're going fast.
This game was the direct sequel to Hamtaro: Ham-Ham's Unite. Instead of trying to round up the Ham-Ham's this time, your goal in this game is still very simple. A devil-ham (get it?) named Spat decides to destroy love and harmony around him with his mischievous nature. Hamtaro is chosen by the angel-ham Harmony to team up with Bijou (who he has to save first) in order to counter Spat's evil ways.Now the concept is very cute but in retrospect, it's kind of horrifying that the devil is trying to destroy love and friendship (sounds like My Little Pony Friendship is Magic season 2 episode 1 and 2.)Like Ham-Hams Unite, this game is challenging, even more so, but as a result, there are more things to do. The graphics in this game are way better than the GBC (and that was VERY good for its time). Fun Land has all the mini-gams and getting the highest score is always a plus. Rocks are used to make gemstones now (and that's how I learned about some gem stones in real life through this gem...I had no idea I was a turquoise).But in this game, you go from location to location to mend the broken bonds between characters...and again the game expects you to know who these characters are. Seriously, I had no idea who Pepper was when introduced in this game and years later, I'm still stumped when she shows up in the anime.But everyone knows the hardest stage in this game was Boo Manor. Unlike some people, I didn't get stuck here (but the Beethoven section in the game was what got me though because you had to know CLASSICAL music and the game was generous to throw hints around the area but if you weren't the type to look everywhere (and who would in the mansion full of creepiness as a kid?) you were screwed.Back to the characters though, this game does better with expanding on them and redeemed Stan to me given how instead of hitting on the chicks, he hangs out with his sister until Sandy and Maxwell hook up and then he goes. A caring brother here then in the last game. Some characters have been demoted from the original game like Panda and Jingle (does he even show up at all).Spat is the best villain ever. He's got a cool, catchy theme, he is pretty threatening (the thing he does at Sandy Beach is messed up. I mean, he pushed Barrette into the ocean and left her to DROWN and it's only a miracle that Seamore knew how to swim) and he BREAKS THE 4TH WALL. Plus, a lot of entertaining things end up happening to him in the game and it's hilarious. It's like Laharl from Disgaea going into another game and then you got Harmony who is Flonne trying to force the power of love on him with hilarious results.This game is way cheaper than the prequel so if you like cuteness and a challenge, get it (and that's if you're a Hamtaro fan).

Defiantly an upgrade from the original game, even though it is still 2D. The Thousand Year Door now features the ability to go into the background to work things out, the ability to turn into a paper airplane, a paper boat, a paper roll and flat to get all the Star Sprites and Star Pieces. It features new mini-games, badges, moves and puzzles and doesn't actually focus on any of the happenings from the 1st game, it's a completely new game.The partners aren't original, as they focus on the original partners in Paper Mario but have different uses. Goombario is replaced by Goombella (the two most useless characters in broth games) who `tattle' and headbonk, Koopa is replaced by Koops who can be thrown around in his shell, Bombette is replaced by Bobbery who can blow up walls, Bow is replaced by Vivian who can make you invisible, Parakoopa is replaced Yoshi to carry you across gaps, Sushi was replaced by the paper boat, Watt was replaced by Ms Mowz and while Flurrie is the only original character and replies on wind.The game is much large and uses the power of the Gamecube to its extent.The battles are now watched by an audience that can either help you or can become your enemies, depending on how you act in battle, you can appeal to them for items and generally just show off Stylish moves to impress or to receive Star Power to use your Special Moves.Mario finds out that Princess Peach has been kidnapped by the X-Nauts and has to rescue her from becoming a host for the evil Demon Queen that resides behind the Thousand Year Door. To do this he must use the Magical Map he received from Peach to locate the Crystal Stars that will stop the Demon.I eagerly await the 3rd installment of this series.

I drooled, eye poped and everything else when I played this game, but there is ONE, only ONE problem with it; it's too [dang] short!  I got to the last boss in 2 days...WITHOUT A MEMORY CARD!!!Still a definite renter.

If you own a GameCube, I hope you enjoy the ergonomic design of the controllers as much as I do.  When Nintendo announced it was releasing a first party wireless controller I was very excited.  This controller doesn't disappoint, with the same button and stick layouts as the wired first-party controllers.You choose a frequency to use (by rotating a numbered dial on both the controller and the receiver that plugs into the controller port on the Cube), which allows you to use up to 4 Wavebirds at a time (should an aggressive Super Smash Bros Melee match be in your future).The controller also has an on/off switch, which allows you to shut it off and save extra battery life, which is a nice touch. I also appreciate the red light on the receiver, which lights up when it receives the signal from the Wavebird (making it very easy to tell if you are in range).The only complaint that I have is one that Nintendo has addressed, namely the lack of Rumble functionality.  To paraphrase Nintendo, to add the rumble feature would have greatly shortened the battery life of the controller.  For many games, the lack of rumble feature isn't an issue, and the WaveBird works perfectly.  For those games that rumble is a major part of, I just use an extension cable for my wired controller.  ;)

Not only has Nintendo cornered the market with the most functional and comfortable controller available, now they have the honor of manufacturing the finest wireless controller on the market. After many hours of use, I have never experienced a single problem with my Wavebird. With a more than adequate range this controller is unrivaled. Highly recommended for marathon gamers.

If you know the GameCube controller you know what you're getting here--except wireless.A few years ago I found a stock of platinum ones at my local Walmart. They were all on sale for $25; I have no idea how that happened. My guess was that they had found old stock in the back.This was around the time the Wii was still hard to find, and production of the WaveBirds had long since ceased. You can imagine my joy when I found them while glancing through Wally's World.But I still wanted the other color just to complete my collectionist mentality, so I ordered the gray one.Now, some time later I purchased the white GameCube controller for the Wii from Amazon. At $30 with free shipping it seemed (and was) a very good deal. Yes, they are directly imported from Japan, but there's no reason you'd need to be concerned unless for some reason you NEED the box in English. They're fine, and I believe the only way to get them was by importing anywayThe benefit of these over the regular GameCube controller? The lengthier cord.But why choose cord when you can have a wireless WaveBird?The construction quality is the same, but that's to be expected from anything by Nintendo. The WB is slightly heavier in that the two AA batteries in the back of the controller make it weightier. They don't come with a built-in rechargeable battery, but I prefer that as I get to use my enelooops.Included in the packaging is a receiver which you plug into the GameCube controller port. It's a little longer than necessary, but I imagine that's to accommodate the antenna. There are wheels on the bottoms of both the controller and receiver, and these click for each number from 1-9 (at least I think the last number is 9). Just match the numbers from controller to the receiver and you're good to go.When I purchased the gray controller used it didn't come with a receiver, but the one included with my platinum worked with it just fine so long as they matched in number.Despite being wireless, and despite how rare the WaveBird may appear, I actually prefer the regular white GameCube controller for three main reasons: 1) comfort; 2) no input latency; 3) rumble.1While the WaveBird and corded controllers are identical in form and size, there is a little bit of extra plastic underneath the WaveBird to allow for the batteries and wheel. While it may not bother some, it actually hinders me from perfectly gripping the controller. My fingers don't wrap around the handles as well as the corded controller, and my unused fingers actually cramp after a while.I'm a 5'8" male with smaller-than-average hands, if that helps you determine my hand size.2I haven't come across this, but some have complained about games not receiving inputs correctly because the WB is wireless. It's true that having cords and a direct plug-in will always lead to higher input ratio than wireless, but I haven't had issues with my games not recognizing my button presses. Still, it's something to note, especially if you're playing certain games where every button press and stick maneuver is crucial, like SSB or Mario Kart.3Rumble.I love it. I need my rumble.Many consider it a gimmick. Sony tried to denounce it as an excuse for not having it when the PS3 initially came with a SIXAXIS controller. But I've loved the rumble feature ever since the first DualShock came out. If I have the option of using a controller with rumble, I'll go for it.There's my review. If you can get a WaveBird for a decent price and you need wireless, I'd say go for it. But you can get the much superior--in my opinion--white GameCube controller with extra cord length, brand new, for a less princely sum.And now that Nintendo announced they'll be reviving the GCN controller for SSB Wii U, those could be another better alternative.

For those of you who have used wireless controllers in the past, the Nintendo Wavebird controller might seem too good to be true.  However, this controller lives up to every bit of its hype.Obviously, the main reason to get this controller is that it is wireless.  Imagine how much nice it would be to have a Gamecube party with four wireless controllers with no cords to get tangled up!  That can happen with the Wavebird.The wavebird includes the two required AA batteries (Maxell brand), that go into the back of the controller.  The sensor plugs into your GCN, but it does not cover up the memory card slot.  The controller itself is almost the same weight as the standard controller.  The only drawback is that the controller has no rumble feature, but I do not miss it too much becuase Nintendo left it out to save battery life.  The controller has a square, orange power light that fades as the battery wears out so you can avoid having your controller suddenly go dead when you are about to beat that last level of your favorit Nintendo game.Nintendo conservatively claims that this product has a range of 20 feet, however, I have tested it and it works much further than that.  The greatest innovation about this for wireless controllers is that it does not use infrared technology like previous wireless controllers.  It uses a radio-like signal similiar to that of a cordless phone, allowing the controller to still function, even when there are things blocking the path to the receiver.This controller is an excellent value and it is a first-party product made by Nintendo which means it meets Nintendo's excellent standards of high quality, and it even comes with a 12-month warranty.  The only improvements would be a rumble feature and maybe more colors (it only comes in gray currently).  ...this accessory is a must-have for any serious Gamecube owners.

****WARNING, SPOILERS INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW****I feel as though I should offer something of an explanation as to my decision to wax philosophical on a title that is as old, honored, and tested as Earthbound. Granted, retro-reviews are indeed all the rage, but I cannot say that I have been moved to ever actually commit to a write-up on one before. There are certainly other games that, as an experience, are by far more readily cited as an example of technical or artistic merit.That's the issue, though: Earthbound is not so much a technical achievement or artistic triumph as it is an experience, a part of one man's life story told in a surreal third person. Shigesato Itoi, Earthbound's creator, undertook a profoundly personal journey, choosing to tell the tale of childhood utilizing his most familiar medium - game design. The result was a journey so profound that those with even the most tenuous grasp of childhood emotions, sensations and innocent awe could not help but walk away without feeling its effects.For a game with the original title of Mother 2, perhaps this childish world view is simply par for the course. In Earthbound, the world is on the brink of ruin; Giygas, an alien entity, has grown strong thanks to the darkness of the world. Its corruption, hatred, greed, violence and depravity eventually allow him to grow powerful and conquer the world. A sentient bee named Buzz Buzz, a resistance fighter of a distant future, travels back in time (to our present) to find a young boy who was said to have the power to defeat Giygas before the alien's strength becomes insurmountable.That young boy is Ness, an average kid from Onett who lives with his mother, sister, and dog. Ness's father, while constantly away on business, can be reached by phone, and provides pithy guidance to his son and maintains his savings account. (The implications regarding absentee fathers are hardly understated in Earthbound, but seek to offer a comforting picture of positive maturity to children. Fathers are important, the game tells us, but so much that their presence - or lack thereof - need not define your identity or sense of self-worth.)You travel throughout the world, battling all manner of whimsical (and sometimes down-right terrifying) foes who have been corrupted by Giygas's all-pervading influence. The player will meet friends who share their goal, and eventually they will overcome many obstacles and face off against Giygas him/itself. However, even this "final confrontation" is hardly the over-wrought clich&eacute; that one might assume.In fact, the battle is one of video game-dom's most famous, and with good reason. What makes the final battle with Giygas so amazing, so profound, is its summation of the childhood journey. While we are given some details of Giygas in Mother, there is very little that we know about him, especially regarding his metamorphosis into the embodiment of evil, fear, and hatred. What is Giygas? Even in his mindless state of complete hatred, he seems lost, hurt...like a child calling out for his mother.Perhaps if we look at Itoi's inspiration for the final confrontation with the End of All Things, we can gain an appreciation for his conception of innocence, and indeed, the gray that lies between the black and white absolutes of established morality. This is no mere quest to topple the villain, but an examination of the journey itself, which is captured on numerous occasions by an itinerant photographer to remind you of your travels and experiences with friends. At game's end, it feels almost like a scrapbook, and one cannot but help and reflect on their childhood adventures, as well.Earthbound is a tremendous game, and an even greater examination of the creator's own worldview. In that, it is impossible not to see something of ourselves in the game, of our own years of innocent wonder, those that led, inexorably, to maturation and knowledge. To top it all off, it is also a solid RPG, though some might find its mechanics to be "dated" by modern standards. Others will find comfort in its old-school charm, and use it as it was intended - as a vehicle through one of the greatest narratives not only in gaming, but modern media.

There are certainly other games that, as an experience, are by far more readily cited as an example of technical or artistic merit.That's the issue, though: Earthbound is not so much a technical achievement or artistic triumph as it is an experience, a part of one man's life story told in a surreal third person. Shigesato Itoi, Earthbound's creator, undertook a profoundly personal journey, choosing to tell the tale of childhood utilizing his most familiar medium - game design. The result was a journey so profound that those with even the most tenuous grasp of childhood emotions, sensations and innocent awe could not help but walk away without feeling its effects.For a game with the original title of Mother 2, perhaps this childish world view is simply par for the course. In Earthbound, the world is on the brink of ruin; Giygas, an alien entity, has grown strong thanks to the darkness of the world. Its corruption, hatred, greed, violence and depravity eventually allow him to grow powerful and conquer the world. A sentient bee named Buzz Buzz, a resistance fighter of a distant future, travels back in time (to our present) to find a young boy who was said to have the power to defeat Giygas before the alien's strength becomes insurmountable.That young boy is Ness, an average kid from Onett who lives with his mother, sister, and dog. Ness's father, while constantly away on business, can be reached by phone, and provides pithy guidance to his son and maintains his savings account. (The implications regarding absentee fathers are hardly understated in Earthbound, but seek to offer a comforting picture of positive maturity to children. Fathers are important, the game tells us, but so much that their presence - or lack thereof - need not define your identity or sense of self-worth.)You travel throughout the world, battling all manner of whimsical (and sometimes down-right terrifying) foes who have been corrupted by Giygas's all-pervading influence. The player will meet friends who share their goal, and eventually they will overcome many obstacles and face off against Giygas him/itself. However, even this "final confrontation" is hardly the over-wrought clich&eacute; that one might assume.In fact, the battle is one of video game-dom's most famous, and with good reason. What makes the final battle with Giygas so amazing, so profound, is its summation of the childhood journey. While we are given some details of Giygas in Mother, there is very little that we know about him, especially regarding his metamorphosis into the embodiment of evil, fear, and hatred. What is Giygas? Even in his mindless state of complete hatred, he seems lost, hurt...like a child calling out for his mother.Perhaps if we look at Itoi's inspiration for the final confrontation with the End of All Things, we can gain an appreciation for his conception of innocence, and indeed, the gray that lies between the black and white absolutes of established morality. This is no mere quest to topple the villain, but an examination of the journey itself, which is captured on numerous occasions by an itinerant photographer to remind you of your travels and experiences with friends. At game's end, it feels almost like a scrapbook, and one cannot but help and reflect on their childhood adventures, as well.Earthbound is a tremendous game, and an even greater examination of the creator's own worldview. In that, it is impossible not to see something of ourselves in the game, of our own years of innocent wonder, those that led, inexorably, to maturation and knowledge. To top it all off, it is also a solid RPG, though some might find its mechanics to be "dated" by modern standards. Others will find comfort in its old-school charm, and use it as it was intended - as a vehicle through one of the greatest narratives not only in gaming, but modern media.
The old Fed might have changed its name, but nothing is new in WWE WrestleMania X8. While X8 is the first and only GameCube wrestling game to date, it amounts to a disappointing game that will have GameCube owners going to their PS2-owning friends' houses to play SmackDown. WrestleMania X8 is the first wrestling game since WWE took over WCW and got sued by wildlife conservationists, and sadly, that's about all that's new. THQ claimed that X8 would be "back to basics," but the biggest difference between the Xbox's WWF Raw and X8 seems to be the games' rosters. There's no real "season" mode, and what there is lacks the flair of even a Street Fighter game's pre-match flair. Grappling and striking still work in the simplistic, puddle-deep way of every game since the classic Yuke's N64 grapplers (many of Yuke's members came from Aki), and while wrestling fans who just want to be The Rock will be pleased with this, people looking for more control and strategy (&agrave; la Crave's UFC games) will be sorely disappointed. It's time for wrestling games to grow beyond the "Our superstars will sell this" era and add some actual depth to the wrestling. WrestleMania certainly looks great with accurate wrestler models and excellent arenas, but all that beauty is wasted on the slack animation system that lacks the fluidity and realism of motion-captured animations in other games. While X8 is good with scaling characters to their actual relative size (Big Show is much larger than Scotty Too Hotty), the animation system doesn't respect the larger characters, so you get people's arms disappearing inside others' bodies during holds and other mutant effects. Also, for some reason, the female wrestlers look awful. Why the male wrestlers look great and the females look like bipedal goats is a mystery. Yuke's has been making wrestling games for years, but for some reason the company can't seem to settle on a successful control scheme. While the moves are simple and easy to perform, other actions-like picking up tables, climbing the corner ropes, and escaping a steel cage-are unintuitive and annoying. You'll get friction burns trying to escape the cage as you have to jiggle the analog stick and bang the A button to make your character sloooooowlyyyy lifffft hiiis armmmm overrrr the caaage. On the other hand, your opponent only has to run toward the cage wall to knock you down. It's silly and annoying, and it easily deflates the fun of a cage match. Last but not least, X8's sound is purely awful. The wrestlers' entrance tunes sound like they're muted through a blanket over the speaker, and the in-match elevator muzak tears away the WWE attitude the game tries so hard to invoke. It's as if Yuke's thought it was still working with the sound-unfriendly N64. Wrestling fans deserve a great wrestling game, but unfortunately, this isn't it. It had promise, but in the end it's just another WWE game hurt by lack of attention to the game in favor of the license.

This game is a tad hard for me, but my wife is addicted to it. Be careful because Dr. Mario prescribes a drug that some people become addicted to.

Animal Crossing is one of the most unusually fun, and addictive games there is.  It is an amazing game that can show you just how far videogaming technology can go.  Like all games, however, it still has it's strengths and weaknesses through comparison of the other games.  I will share my opinion of: the bad, the neutral, and the good about this game.The Bad:1.  Resetti the mole may scare younger kids.  I will explain a bit more thoroughly about the character in the good.  Although I think Resetti is humorous, he will yell at you a lot if you either forget to save; or reset on purpose to erase an event like Spike painting your roof black...  Now, Resetti doesn't start out yelling at you.  He gives you two friendly warnings before getting harsh, so at least you have time to prepare for his temper tantrums.  There is one warning I would like to give the gamers out there, but it's kind of a spoiler.  So, if you don't want any surprises bad or good ruined, just skip on to number two.  For those of you who don't mind slight spoilers, the warning is this: after you reset your game a number of times (like 6 or 7) he will say he will reset your game and make you start from the beginning.  DON'T BE FOOLED!  This is merely a childish prank he plays.  The screen will come back on and he will be like "GOTCHA!" and nothing will have happened.  I warn you of this, because this nasty surprise almost had me upset.  After he does this, once he will pull this about every third reset (you will notice a pattern after this point) with the same result: nothing happens, he just continues to lecture you like always.2.  Your neighbors are not fully trustworthy.  Never carry valuable items, or tons of bells (the game's currency) with you when you talk to your neighbors.  There is no way of predicting how the neighbor will converse with you, and before you know it, you either lose most of your bells, or get your valuable item unwillingly traded for some piece of junk.  Also, NEVER play card games with a camper.  I suppose this is good for teaching children to be careful with their stuff, but make sure this doesn't effect their trust on people in the real world.3.  Paying off your mortgage can be tedious.  You will either have to fish or catch bugs until you are sick of it.  You can do jobs for your neighbors, but there is little chance of you getting money from them.  The "odd jobs" they give you, is better for getting furniture, clothing, and stationary.  You can also collect seashells, but that doesn't really give you enough money to make it worth your while.  That is good for the start of the game, however, so you can earn enough to get a fishing rod or net.  If you are a real dare devil and you have the net, you can shake trees to get small amounts of money, a couple of pieces of furniture, and three or four beehives.  You can use your net and catch the bees that fall out of the tree, but be careful that you don't get stung.  I will not tell you how to catch the bees, but I will tell you this: don't aim for the hive.  It doesn't work.  I have tried this, and with painful results to my character...  In the event you do get stung, your face will be ugly.  If you absolutely hate the look, save and quit and come back to get rid of it.  Don't shake trees without the net.  It's not worth it, as the bees are difficult to get away from.4.  Not very fun at night if you play based on your time.  Although there are a few things to do, the store closes at ten or eleven pm (depending on the stage) and cuts you off from earning money from selling (one of the main ways of making money).  On top of that, some neighbors can go to bed as early as nine pm, which is why I wouldn't advise asking for jobs at and after nine.  What happens is, someone will say, "Mitzi borrowed my camera" or "Deliver this to Maple" but you can't do the job after nine when they are in bed.  This means you will either have to decline the job (which upsets them), or agree to do it and wait until they get out of bed, which will likely be hours.  Not worth it.  The one thing that's good about playing at night, is there is the small chance you can meet Wisp.  I will not say too much to avoid a spoiler situation, but I will say it's worth it to meet him.  However, chances of meeting him are rather slim, and it has to be really late at night (were talking midnight here).  If you wish to play at nighttime in the game, but your parents won't let you stay up, I suggest making your town have opposite time.5.  The HRA system stinks.  This is probably one area the game designers failed, although, it's hard to get a good system for a "beautiful" home when beauty really is in the eye of the beholder.  It doesn't matter if your room is a complete masterpiece.  If every thing is mixed or your wallpaper and carpet don't match, you will get a low score, and the HRA will say ugly things about you in the mail.  There is a way to get a high score from them, but it's technical, concerning themes and junk.  Make sure to tell young children that it's just bad programming so they don't lose self esteem and think their house is hideous.  On top of that, the store owner forces you to join, so you have to deal with their antics whether you like it or not.6.  The neigbors... are unpredictable.  They are a lot moodier than they are supposed to be.  I have seen two of them talking, one even getting a new outfit, and they both walk away upset.  Befuddling.  You can't even talk to them when they are like this.  Also, save often if you want to guard your roof color.  The animals seem unnaturally obsessed with painting your roof various colors without your permission.  It's a pain.  All I want to do is keep my blue roof...  My mom has also noticed they can be rather insulting at times (particuarly the snobs and Gracie).  Most of this is good natured, however, just keep a slight eye on younger children to make sure they don't develop certain attitude problems.  This itself isn't a major problem, though.  I didn't even notice it until my mom said something.7.  The snobs can teach you acts of questionable morality.  The main one I wish to address considers the lost and found at the police station.  Players can falsely claim items at the lost and found.  I have been there many times.  Only once have I claimed something of my own.  Just make sure you explain to impressionable younger children why it's okay to steal from the lost and found in the game, but NEVER in real life.The Neutral: These are things that can be good or bad depending on how you look at it and/or what form it comes in.1.  Numerous glitches.  The game has some glitches in it.  If you don't like or want anything to do with glitches, this is instantly a bad thing.  If you are slightly more tolerant of "beneficial" glitches this is can be a slightly good thing.  If you pay off all of your mortgage (to the point you own an account) you can use the dopplegangler trick to earn numerous bells.  I won't explain it in detail, for it's neither here nor there, but I will say this: express a little caution when doing the trick.  It won't hurt the game, but there are certain steps you have to follow in proper order for it to be successful.  This is probably the only "good" glitch in the game.  The rest of the glitches, that I know of, can be caused by time traveling and are NOT good glitches!  Time traveling can be done by changing the time and date on your game.  While it maybe beneficial in some areas (like if you want Christmas in July), I wouldn't recommend doing it often.  I have heard it causes some "bugs" including: not being able to hear music in your house unless your close to the tape deck (this I have verified to be true), and trees taking too long to grow (I think this is also true, but may be corrected by slowing down time traveling to only a single day at a time).  On top of that, if you go too far forward or backward in time (believe me, I learned this the hard way), your town will be covered with more weeds than you can shake a stick at, you will get bugs in your house (nasty!), and if things stay a wreck long enough, your neighbors will move away one by one until the problems are dealt with.2.  The storage systems.  There is quite some room for letters and personalized clothing designs, but little room for furniture and such.  A basement will help, but only for a while.  If you are a pack rat like me, this could be a big problem...3.  Teaches apple polishing.  A term which here means: saying things to overly flatter your neighbors in order to get presents.  I mean think about it, are you really going to tell Winnie her clothes are unflattering when you can butter her up to get a free outfit?  I am not sure whether this is a good thing or a bad thing, so it goes in this section.  You decide.4.  This game is addictive.  I guess this can be good, because games are only addictive if you enjoy playing them right?  But I think this can also be bad, because it encourages you to play every day to see what's new.  Just be careful not to become so addicted you don't have time for things in the real world.The Good:1.  Teaches kids responsibility.  You actually can learn a thing or two about paying off mortgages, earning a living, and being neighborly.  Your character's mom may also give you a few tips on how to be social.2.  The museum can teach players some real fascinating facts.  It doesn't really matter what age you are either, you will probably learn at least a fact or two before you complete it.  The paintings aren't really educational, but look closely at them.  My mom recognized a Washington painting considered to be real, and I recognized a painting known as "The Embrace" in real life.  One thing I do not understand is: why is Blathers afraid of insects?  He is an owl, aren't owls supposed to eat insects?  It is rather humorous, though.  He seems to have something negative to say about every insect including the beautiful butterflies, and the ladybugs.3.  You can name your place and character whatever you want!  Provided it doesn't exceed the character limit, which is so short it's hard to do anything elaborate and is very annoying.  Regardless, it's fun to come up with names.  You can have only one town per memory card, but if you have a different town on another memory card, the two can interact which is very cool!  On top of that, you don't always have to base your town's time on your own.  You can arrange it where if you play at 3pm, your town will be 3am.  That way, if you base one town on your own time, and base another on "opposite" time, you can play day and night if you want to.4.  The neighbors can be fun.  It's true, they can be a pain like I explained earlier, but they can also be delightful to chat with.  You never know what could happen when you just speak to them.  They can give you a gift, a quiz (which results in a gift if you answer correctly, although, some quizzes have no right or wrong answers and you get something anyway), a showing of an interesting letter, and many other unpredictable surprises.  A couple of tips are: to use your common sense (like if Winnie asks you "Don't I look good in this?" don't say "I'm sorry..."), and don't lie to the guys that like to do push ups if they ask "Is *put name of object here* yours?" and you want it.  When the snobs ask the question lie to them if you want the object and it is worth half of your money.5.  The game acknowledges holidays.  This includes your birthday if you have told them.  How cool is that?  Seriously, my neighbor, Pecan, was waiting outside my house's door to give me a present on my birthday!  Other presents came for me in the mail!  And during Halloween evening, everyone is in costume and wants candy!  They also do a New Years countdown!  On top of all that, other non-huge events also go on throughout the year.  Like in June, there is a fishing tourney every Sunday.  Tell me, how many games acknowledge real time and events, including your birthday?6.  Teaches kids how to keep track of times and dates.  Special people like Wendel, Saharah, and Redd come once a month or so on a certain date.  If players want to see them, they will have to learn to keep track of the dates they arrive, and the times they will be there.  On top of that, there are certain weekly treats like a guitar playing dog on Saturdays, or a pig selling turnips on Sundays, so this actually may make kids want to be more coordinated.7.  Teaches the basics of stock marketing, and the work force.  These are interesting concepts.  Although fishing and catching bugs may be out of date for current businesses, the store owner, a raccoon who gives you a house and makes you pay off your mortgage, will make you work for him temporarily to help you pay off your first mortgage.  This gives player a small taste of the trial and error of working for a boss.  Notice how he freaks out when you change out of your uniform during work?  He will accept it, but in real life I don't believe bosses tolerate such things well.  This game can also teach stock marketing with the "Turnip Market".  When players want to learn how to buy and sell turnips for a profit, they will need to learn to buy the turnips when prices are low, and sell them when prices are high.  In real life, plain stocks work similarly.  It's rather impressive that game designers can teach such advanced topics in a fun form for kids.Well, I think that about raps it up.  Overall, Animal Crossing is a fun game.  I do recommend it for any age, provided younger children are slightly watched.  The game is pretty realistic though, and it is impressive what game designers can do.
Animal Crossing is one of the most unusually fun, and addictive games there is.  It is an amazing game that can show you just how far videogaming technology can go.  Like all games, however, it still has it's strengths and weaknesses through comparison of the other games.  I will share my opinion of: the bad, the neutral, and the good about this game.The Bad:1.

There is one warning I would like to give the gamers out there, but it's kind of a spoiler.  So, if you don't want any surprises bad or good ruined, just skip on to number two.  For those of you who don't mind slight spoilers, the warning is this: after you reset your game a number of times (like 6 or 7) he will say he will reset your game and make you start from the beginning.  DON'T BE FOOLED!  This is merely a childish prank he plays.  The screen will come back on and he will be like "GOTCHA!" and nothing will have happened.  I warn you of this, because this nasty surprise almost had me upset.  After he does this, once he will pull this about every third reset (you will notice a pattern after this point) with the same result: nothing happens, he just continues to lecture you like always.2.  Your neighbors are not fully trustworthy.  Never carry valuable items, or tons of bells (the game's currency) with you when you talk to your neighbors.  There is no way of predicting how the neighbor will converse with you, and before you know it, you either lose most of your bells, or get your valuable item unwillingly traded for some piece of junk.  Also, NEVER play card games with a camper.  I suppose this is good for teaching children to be careful with their stuff, but make sure this doesn't effect their trust on people in the real world.3.  Paying off your mortgage can be tedious.  You will either have to fish or catch bugs until you are sick of it.  You can do jobs for your neighbors, but there is little chance of you getting money from them.  The "odd jobs" they give you, is better for getting furniture, clothing, and stationary.  You can also collect seashells, but that doesn't really give you enough money to make it worth your while.  That is good for the start of the game, however, so you can earn enough to get a fishing rod or net.  If you are a real dare devil and you have the net, you can shake trees to get small amounts of money, a couple of pieces of furniture, and three or four beehives.  You can use your net and catch the bees that fall out of the tree, but be careful that you don't get stung.  I will not tell you how to catch the bees, but I will tell you this: don't aim for the hive.  It doesn't work.  I have tried this, and with painful results to my character...  In the event you do get stung, your face will be ugly.  If you absolutely hate the look, save and quit and come back to get rid of it.  Don't shake trees without the net.  It's not worth it, as the bees are difficult to get away from.4.  Not very fun at night if you play based on your time.  Although there are a few things to do, the store closes at ten or eleven pm (depending on the stage) and cuts you off from earning money from selling (one of the main ways of making money).  On top of that, some neighbors can go to bed as early as nine pm, which is why I wouldn't advise asking for jobs at and after nine.  What happens is, someone will say, "Mitzi borrowed my camera" or "Deliver this to Maple" but you can't do the job after nine when they are in bed.  This means you will either have to decline the job (which upsets them), or agree to do it and wait until they get out of bed, which will likely be hours.  Not worth it.  The one thing that's good about playing at night, is there is the small chance you can meet Wisp.  I will not say too much to avoid a spoiler situation, but I will say it's worth it to meet him.  However, chances of meeting him are rather slim, and it has to be really late at night (were talking midnight here).  If you wish to play at nighttime in the game, but your parents won't let you stay up, I suggest making your town have opposite time.5.  The HRA system stinks.  This is probably one area the game designers failed, although, it's hard to get a good system for a "beautiful" home when beauty really is in the eye of the beholder.  It doesn't matter if your room is a complete masterpiece.  If every thing is mixed or your wallpaper and carpet don't match, you will get a low score, and the HRA will say ugly things about you in the mail.  There is a way to get a high score from them, but it's technical, concerning themes and junk.  Make sure to tell young children that it's just bad programming so they don't lose self esteem and think their house is hideous.  On top of that, the store owner forces you to join, so you have to deal with their antics whether you like it or not.6.  The neigbors... are unpredictable.  They are a lot moodier than they are supposed to be.  I have seen two of them talking, one even getting a new outfit, and they both walk away upset.  Befuddling.  You can't even talk to them when they are like this.  Also, save often if you want to guard your roof color.  The animals seem unnaturally obsessed with painting your roof various colors without your permission.  It's a pain.  All I want to do is keep my blue roof...  My mom has also noticed they can be rather insulting at times (particuarly the snobs and Gracie).  Most of this is good natured, however, just keep a slight eye on younger children to make sure they don't develop certain attitude problems.  This itself isn't a major problem, though.  I didn't even notice it until my mom said something.7.  The snobs can teach you acts of questionable morality.  The main one I wish to address considers the lost and found at the police station.  Players can falsely claim items at the lost and found.  I have been there many times.  Only once have I claimed something of my own.  Just make sure you explain to impressionable younger children why it's okay to steal from the lost and found in the game, but NEVER in real life.The Neutral: These are things that can be good or bad depending on how you look at it and/or what form it comes in.1.  Numerous glitches.  The game has some glitches in it.  If you don't like or want anything to do with glitches, this is instantly a bad thing.  If you are slightly more tolerant of "beneficial" glitches this is can be a slightly good thing.  If you pay off all of your mortgage (to the point you own an account) you can use the dopplegangler trick to earn numerous bells.  I won't explain it in detail, for it's neither here nor there, but I will say this: express a little caution when doing the trick.  It won't hurt the game, but there are certain steps you have to follow in proper order for it to be successful.  This is probably the only "good" glitch in the game.  The rest of the glitches, that I know of, can be caused by time traveling and are NOT good glitches!  Time traveling can be done by changing the time and date on your game.  While it maybe beneficial in some areas (like if you want Christmas in July), I wouldn't recommend doing it often.  I have heard it causes some "bugs" including: not being able to hear music in your house unless your close to the tape deck (this I have verified to be true), and trees taking too long to grow (I think this is also true, but may be corrected by slowing down time traveling to only a single day at a time).  On top of that, if you go too far forward or backward in time (believe me, I learned this the hard way), your town will be covered with more weeds than you can shake a stick at, you will get bugs in your house (nasty!), and if things stay a wreck long enough, your neighbors will move away one by one until the problems are dealt with.2.  The storage systems.  There is quite some room for letters and personalized clothing designs, but little room for furniture and such.  A basement will help, but only for a while.  If you are a pack rat like me, this could be a big problem...3.  Teaches apple polishing.  A term which here means: saying things to overly flatter your neighbors in order to get presents.  I mean think about it, are you really going to tell Winnie her clothes are unflattering when you can butter her up to get a free outfit?  I am not sure whether this is a good thing or a bad thing, so it goes in this section.  You decide.4.  This game is addictive.  I guess this can be good, because games are only addictive if you enjoy playing them right?  But I think this can also be bad, because it encourages you to play every day to see what's new.  Just be careful not to become so addicted you don't have time for things in the real world.The Good:1.  Teaches kids responsibility.  You actually can learn a thing or two about paying off mortgages, earning a living, and being neighborly.  Your character's mom may also give you a few tips on how to be social.2.  The museum can teach players some real fascinating facts.  It doesn't really matter what age you are either, you will probably learn at least a fact or two before you complete it.  The paintings aren't really educational, but look closely at them.  My mom recognized a Washington painting considered to be real, and I recognized a painting known as "The Embrace" in real life.  One thing I do not understand is: why is Blathers afraid of insects?  He is an owl, aren't owls supposed to eat insects?  It is rather humorous, though.  He seems to have something negative to say about every insect including the beautiful butterflies, and the ladybugs.3.  You can name your place and character whatever you want!  Provided it doesn't exceed the character limit, which is so short it's hard to do anything elaborate and is very annoying.  Regardless, it's fun to come up with names.  You can have only one town per memory card, but if you have a different town on another memory card, the two can interact which is very cool!  On top of that, you don't always have to base your town's time on your own.  You can arrange it where if you play at 3pm, your town will be 3am.  That way, if you base one town on your own time, and base another on "opposite" time, you can play day and night if you want to.4.  The neighbors can be fun.  It's true, they can be a pain like I explained earlier, but they can also be delightful to chat with.  You never know what could happen when you just speak to them.  They can give you a gift, a quiz (which results in a gift if you answer correctly, although, some quizzes have no right or wrong answers and you get something anyway), a showing of an interesting letter, and many other unpredictable surprises.  A couple of tips are: to use your common sense (like if Winnie asks you "Don't I look good in this?" don't say "I'm sorry..."), and don't lie to the guys that like to do push ups if they ask "Is *put name of object here* yours?" and you want it.  When the snobs ask the question lie to them if you want the object and it is worth half of your money.5.  The game acknowledges holidays.  This includes your birthday if you have told them.  How cool is that?  Seriously, my neighbor, Pecan, was waiting outside my house's door to give me a present on my birthday!  Other presents came for me in the mail!  And during Halloween evening, everyone is in costume and wants candy!  They also do a New Years countdown!  On top of all that, other non-huge events also go on throughout the year.  Like in June, there is a fishing tourney every Sunday.  Tell me, how many games acknowledge real time and events, including your birthday?6.  Teaches kids how to keep track of times and dates.  Special people like Wendel, Saharah, and Redd come once a month or so on a certain date.  If players want to see them, they will have to learn to keep track of the dates they arrive, and the times they will be there.  On top of that, there are certain weekly treats like a guitar playing dog on Saturdays, or a pig selling turnips on Sundays, so this actually may make kids want to be more coordinated.7.  Teaches the basics of stock marketing, and the work force.  These are interesting concepts.  Although fishing and catching bugs may be out of date for current businesses, the store owner, a raccoon who gives you a house and makes you pay off your mortgage, will make you work for him temporarily to help you pay off your first mortgage.  This gives player a small taste of the trial and error of working for a boss.  Notice how he freaks out when you change out of your uniform during work?  He will accept it, but in real life I don't believe bosses tolerate such things well.  This game can also teach stock marketing with the "Turnip Market".  When players want to learn how to buy and sell turnips for a profit, they will need to learn to buy the turnips when prices are low, and sell them when prices are high.  In real life, plain stocks work similarly.  It's rather impressive that game designers can teach such advanced topics in a fun form for kids.Well, I think that about raps it up.  Overall, Animal Crossing is a fun game.  I do recommend it for any age, provided younger children are slightly watched.  The game is pretty realistic though, and it is impressive what game designers can do.
did luidi do something wrong like get bad grades or something and drop out of school and ended up being a plummer? well yea i guess he's been grounded for like a billion years from being a star of any game and if he IS a star in one the word "MARIO" is in the title and this game "luigi's mansion" oh yeaaaa he has a mansion and since he's grounded from bad grades people he has to clean the whole house with a vacum

By 2012, its almost and oldie, but still is GREAT.  Neverending fun for young (my 4yr old enjoys it) and old (even my wife will partake at times).  Worth every penny.  Don't think twice about it.
Many reviews claim this; I wholeheartedly concur.  Yoshi's Island is a brilliant offering of two dimensional level design and pure platforming goodness.  From the start, you can expect hectic thrills (good, long ones too; this game is quite lengthy) while playing as the beloved Yoshi saddled with a wailing baby Mario.  From here, gaming bliss takes over.Yoshi's Island made the transition from Super Nintendo to Gameboy Advance surprising smoothly, suffering only from minor sound compression and scrolling issues (which are a minute annoyance at worst, negligible at best).  The old-time, tried (and still true), beloved gameplay has remained perfectly intact.  It's an immense joy to re-experience this, yet the greatness of this gameplay still eagerly welcomes newcomers.Everybody who has an interest in platform games would do themselves a favor by picking up this marquis gem (a crystalline supplement to those all-too-common diamonds in the rough).

Super Mario SunshineAfter Super Mario 64 set the bar for one of Mario&#8217;s greatest game in order to keep up with Sony&#8217;s Playstation Sega&#8217;s Sega Dreamcast a sequel to Super Mario 64 had been in the works for several years; the cancelled games Super Mario 64 2 and Super Mario128 were some ideas Nintendo had for a direct sequel Super Mario 64 2 was said to be developed on the Nintendo 64DD, but ended up being canceled. For those who don&#8217;t know The Nintendo 64DD was a disk system attachment for the N64 like the Sega CD for the Sega Genesis. The first games to be released for the new system would be SimCity 64, Mario Artist, Pok&eacute;mon(Pocket Monsters) and Mother 3. There were only very limited quantities of the 64DD were made available through stores. As a result, the 64DD was only supported by Nintendo for a short period of time and only ten games were released for it. Most 64DD games were either cancelled entirely, released as normal Nintendo 64 games as cartridge-based storage sizes had increased, or eventually ported to the next-generation Nintendo GameCube console.Super Mario Sunshine has some good things but with all that said let&#8217;s begin this reviewStory/Plot: Mario sets out for Isle Delfino for a vacation with Princess Peach, and her long-time steward Toadsworth. Upon a rough plane landing at the island's airstrip, they find that the once-pristine island has been polluted and plastered with graffiti. As a result of this pollution, sun-shaped objects called &#34;Shine Sprites&#34;, the island's sources of power, have disappeared, and the island is covered in a perpetual shadow. The culprit seen spreading the graffiti is disguised as Mario, who is named &#34;Shadow Mario&#34;. To help with cleaning the airstrip, Mario finds FLUDD, a powerful water cannon which is toted like a backpack and is also created by Professor E. Gadd. Mario is promptly arrested after the player defeats a slime-covered Piranha Plant at the airstrip which makes the hole in the runway disappear and recovers a Shine Sprite, falsely accused of vandalizing the island. He is put on trial, however it turns out to be a mere kangaroo court where the judge immediately finds Mario guilty and orders him to clean up the graffiti and recover the Shine Sprites. Until then, he is forbidden from leaving the island until he does so. The next day, Mario begins his adventure to find a way to clear his name and locate the real criminal, while restoring tranquility and order to Isle Delfino. After defeating another slime-covered Piranha Plant and rising a disappeared statue out of the ground, they see Shadow Mario on top of the statue for the first time who jumps off the statue, grabs Peach, and runs off with her. Mario chases him and takes him down and he creates a graffiti portal on the restored statue and escapes through it. Mario follows him through the portal that leads to Bianco Hills, one of the other areas of Isle Delfino where he defeats another slime-covered Piranha Plant and rises a disappeared cliff, some trees, and a section of a wall out of the ground and recovers another Shine Sprite. After defeating two more slime-covered Piranha Plants and restoring the disappeared boathouse and lighthouse that unlock portals from Delfino Plaza to two of Isle Delfino's other locations, Mario follows Shadow Mario, who has kidnapped Princess Peach, and has escaped on a Bowser-designed boat to Pinna Park, an amusement park located just off the coast of Isle Delfino's &#34;tail&#34;. There, Mario defeats a huge Bowser robot being controlled by Shadow Mario which is called Mecha Bowser by firing water rockets at it on the roller coaster. It is then revealed that Shadow Mario's real identity is Bowser Jr., the youngest son of Bowser. Bowser Jr having been told by Bowser that Peach is his mother. (Mario: Peach how could you? Peach: But I don&#8217;t even reme. Mario: no physically how could you?  )  Bowser Jr wields a magic brush that creates graffiti and is also created by E. Gadd. Bowser Jr turns the remains of Mecha Bowser into a hot air balloon and escapes again with Princess Peach. When learning the truth, Peach is visually upset for a second. He is last seen heading for Corona Mountain, a volcano where Bowser is holding a family vacation of his own. After Mario continues to clean Isle Delfino, retrieving Shine Sprites, and defeats Bowser Jr., still disguised as Shadow Mario, at least once in all of the areas of the island, a flood falls upon Delfino Plaza, opening up a cave that leads into Corona Mountain that Shadow Mario disappears into. Mario enters the volcano, defeats Bowser and Bowser Jr. by flipping over the hot tub they are in and rescues the Princess. Mario and the Princess fall from the sky with Bowser and Bowser Jr. While the others are plummeting down, Princess Peach floats down to safety using her parasol. Princess Peach lands on an island beside Delfino Plaza on her feet, but on the same island, Mario gets his head stuck in the sand, but gets out. However, FLUDD becomes damaged during the battle with Bowser, supposedly beyond repair. The Shine Gate's power is restored and the Toads repair FLUDD shortly afterward and Mario, Peach and the others resume their vacation, while Bowser admits to his son that Peach was not really his mother.Okay I have minor problems with this 1. When Bowser Jr was about to take Peach to Corona Mountain why she did just jump off when she had the chance. 2. Why was Mario arrested for a crime he didn&#8217;t commit? Lastly the benefits if you didn&#8217;t get 120 shine spritesIncomplete ending After the credits, if the player has collected less than all 120 shine sprites, a picture shows Il Piantissimo, a sprinter that Mario raced during the game, finding the brush that Bowser Jr. used to vandalize Isle Delfino.Completed ending however, if the player has collected all 120 shine sprites, a picture of the entire cast with the words &#34;Have a relaxing vacation&#34; is displayed instead.So we get a freaking post card. Not as impressive as getting the 120 power stars in Super mario 64.Gameplay: Players start off in the hub world of Isle Delfino and access various worlds via portals which become available as the game progresses. Like Super Mario 64 obtaining Stars, players obtain Shine Sprites by clearing various objectives given to Mario upon entering each stage, with more objectives unlocked in each level after clearing an existing one. There are also various hidden areas and challenges across Isle Delfino where more Shine Sprites can be obtained. Throughout the game, players may also find Blue Coins, which can be exchanged for more Shine Sprites. In this game, Mario is joined by a robotic backpack named FLUDD (Flash Liquidizing Ultra Dousing Device), which uses the power of water to clean away slime and help Mario reach new places. Mario starts with two default nozzles for FLUDD, Spray and Hover, which he can quickly switch between. The Spray nozzle lets Mario squirt a stream of water which he can use to clean slime, attack enemies, and activate certain mechanisms. Meanwhile, the Hover nozzle lets Mario hover in the air for a short period of time, allowing him to cross large gaps and spray things below him. As the game progresses, Mario unlocks two additional nozzles for FLUDD which can substituted with the Hover nozzle; the Rocket nozzle, which shoots Mario high up into the air; and the Turbo nozzle, which moves Mario at high speeds, allowing him to run across water and break into certain areas. Each of FLUDD's nozzles uses water from its reserves, which can be refilled via water sources such as rivers or fountains. There are also some areas where FLUDD is taken away from Mario, forcing him to rely on his natural platforming abilities. At certain points in the game, Mario may come across an egg which hatches into a Yoshi after being brought a fruit it asks for. Yoshi can be ridden upon and can attack by spitting juice, which can clear certain obstacles that water cannot, and use its tongue to eat enemies or other pieces of fruit which can change its color. Yoshi will disappear if it runs out of juice, which can be replenished by eating more fruit, or falls into deep water.Story 4.5/5 Gameplay 4.5/5 Music 5/5 Overall 9/10 = A-

Mario finally returns to the world he once ruled in Super Mario Sunshine. This is the unofficial sequel from his last outing by himself since 1996! Mario Party, Mario Golf, and Mario Tennis do not count. The graphics put the Cube's graphic processor to the maxinum. The contraption on his back is a water gun which squirts out water(duh)to take out paint and a bunch of other stuff. Shigeru Miyamoto(creator of Mario)says the plot is about Mario and Princess Peach travel to an exotic island where Mario is falsely accused of painting grafitti on walls and our hero must wash the paint off the walls and find out who did this horrible crime... He can do double jumps and triple jumps off walls like a hot tamale. Looks Luigi will be put back into the shadows after Mario's brand new adventure comes out.

Arguable the single most important videogame in history, SUPER MARIO BROTHERS, along with the Nintendo Entertainment System (hereafter referred to as the NES) singlehandedly resurrected the video game industry after the historic crash of 1983-1984.  Rather than reviewing the game itself, which has been done many times, I think many people may find the history how of this revolutionary title came to the videogame industry's rescue very interesting; I know I do.  I draw much of this information from various websites, one very good one in particular; unfortunately, I can't really plug them due to Amazon's policies.  Email me if you want the websites.By 1983, the gaming industry, in existence for a mere twelve years, had risen to an astonishing 3.2 billion dollar industry.  Atari spearheaded the industry, which introduced its first console in 1977 (Atari Video Computer System), and since had grown to hold two thirds of the entire market.  However, in 1984 all this would end with a thunderous crash.  This concise overview will show you the history of the home consol crash and how SUPER MARIO BROTHERS came to the rescue.In 1976, Warner Communications bought Atari for $28 million from the company's founder, Nolan Bushnell.  Over the next two years, Atari, suffering major production problems and Bushnell's bizarre management, lost Warner millions.  Bushnell and Warner's CEO fought, and in 1978 Bushnell was forced to leave.  Warner totally revamped the working style, and in 1979-1980, produced twelve new titles.  However, Atari was still dragging down Warner's stock.  Struggling to gain the market share, Atari made the smartest move they possible could have; in 1980, they began licensing arcade games, the first being SPACE INVADERS.  Over the next two years, Atari overtook the market, bringing in over half of Warner's overall profits.However, very significant problems would totally destroy the infant industry.  In 1981, Atari released PAC MAN on the VCS, and, because it was such a huge arcade hit, quickly became a bestseller.  Unfortunately, the quality was very low.  This was a major blow to the company's image, with fans and critics alike extremely disappointed.Another major stumble was one of video games' most infamous games, ET.  Warner bought the rights from Spielberg for twenty one million dollars. Atari, expecting the game to be as big a hit as the movie, which was the highest grossing film at that point, purportedly made more ET cartridges than there were consoles themselves.  ET proved to be a huge flop, nearly breaking Atari.By 1983, Atari was in serious trouble.  Suing Activision (which was disgruntled Atari employees who broke off and formed their own company) and Imagic, the two leading third party developers, Atari tried to gain control over its software catalogue.  Atari lost the suits.  Third party developers began popping up overnight, and the industry becomes saturated with very low-quality products.  (One of the most controversial is CUSTER'S REVENGE by Mystique, where the goal is to rape a Native American woman while avoiding being shot by arrows.)  The third-party developers went bankrupt; these cartridges were heavily discounted, and the major companies couldn't compete.  Another factor is the home computer market, that was just starting to come alive in 1984.  With an increasing amount of computer games and low prices, people started buying these over the consoles.All these factors lead to the crash of 1984.  In 1983 alone, Atari lost $356 million ($2 million daily).  Warner sold Atari to Jack Tramiel, former head of Commodore.  The video game industry died, with no major American corporation coming anywhere near it.  Enter Nintendo.A little history here will be highly illuminating as well.  What many people don't realise is Nintendo is a very old company, founded in 1889 (yes, you read that right) as a playing card company.  It became Japan's largest playing card company, and was very successful. In the 1960s, they moved away from the cards and got into the game and toy markets.  (A very interesting sidenote: during that same decade, Nintendo's president opened up a `special hotel' rented `by the hour.'  Supposedly, the married president was one of the hotel's top customers).  In the 1970s and early 1980s, the company scored significant points with big arcade hits and the Game and Watch product line.  In 1983, Nintendo released the Famicom (Family Computer).  It was a massive hit in Japan.  In 1983, Nintendo went to Atari because they wanted to release the Famicon to the American market.  Do to complications I won't go into, the deal fail through.  In 1984 they were looking to broaden their market share.1985, Nintendo announced the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System.  They release SUPER MARIO BROTHERS in Japan, scoring a huge hit.  In 1986, the NES comes full throttle into the American market, quickly becoming the biggest selling console ever, largely because of this title.  The NES owes much of its success to SUPER MARIO BROTHERS.  Coming prepacked with the console, there are an estimated 40 million copies of SMB in existence, making it the highest selling video game ever.Unparalleled, SMB blew open the doors to the videogaming world.  With rich palettes of colour, eight four level worlds, spot-on play control, and expert level design, SMB was a much longer game than most of Atari's products and was a game unlike any other at that time.  SMB also had the benefit of being very simple to grasp; run, jump, and fire.  It was also the first side-sroller as we know it, though Atari's PITFALL set up the concept.  Also, it's one of the best.  Without SMB, NES wouldn't have been nearly as big a hit.In the end, Nintendo came at the industry's key moment.  With a powerful new console and a very well-designed game, Nintendo resurrected video gaming.  With its phenomenal success of the NES and this game, the video game industry once again took off, becoming one of the world's most significant economical contributors.And we very largely have this game to thank for it.

A Note on Duck HuntThis review focuses more on "Super Mario Bros."  This particular version of the game is a dual game cart and includes Duck Hunt, where you hunt ducks with the Zapper Gun (awesome!) and if you miss too many times the b-st-rd dog will laugh at you for sucking so bad at a mere child's game.  Now, one thing to be aware of is due to the technology used, Duck Hunt DOES NOT WORK on new televisions such as HD TVs.  You'll need an old CRT television.  Overall a fun game but the type of title that now aways would be an Internet or phone title rather than a full blown main stream release.  How far we have come since the NES days!  This is the last you'll hear of Duck Hunt in this review.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Review Proper:Arguably the single most important videogame in history, SUPER MARIO BROTHERS, along with the Nintendo Entertainment System (hereafter referred to as the NES) singlehandedly resurrected the video game industry after the historic crash of 1983-1984.

(A very interesting sidenote: during that same decade, Nintendo's president opened up a `special hotel' rented `by the hour.' Supposedly, the married president was one of the hotel's top customers). In the 1970s and early 1980s, the company scored significant points with big arcade hits and the Game and Watch product line. In 1983, Nintendo released the Famicom (Family Computer). It was a massive hit in Japan. In 1983, Nintendo went to Atari because they wanted to release the Famicon to the American market. Do to complications I won't go into, the deal fail through. In 1984 they were looking to broaden their market share.1985, Nintendo announced the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System. They release SUPER MARIO BROTHERS in Japan, scoring a huge hit. In 1986, the NES comes full throttle into the American market, quickly becoming the biggest selling console ever, largely because of this title. The NES owes much of its success to SUPER MARIO BROTHERS. Coming prepacked with the console, there are an estimated 40 million copies of SMB in existence, making it the highest selling video game ever.Unparalleled, SMB blew open the doors to the videogaming world. With rich palettes of colour, eight four level worlds, spot-on play control, and expert level design, SMB was a much longer game than most of Atari's products and was a game unlike any other at that time. SMB also had the benefit of being very simple to grasp; run, jump, and fire. It was also the first side-sroller as we know it, though Atari's PITFALL set up the concept. Also, it's one of the best. Without SMB, NES wouldn't have been nearly as big a hit.In the end, Nintendo came at the industry's key moment. With a powerful new console and a very well-designed game, Nintendo resurrected video gaming. With its phenomenal success of the NES and this game, the video game industry once again took off, becoming one of the world's most significant economical contributors.And we very largely have this game to thank for it
So quickly after their last brain-based hit, Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!, Nintendo and NST have followed up with the colorful Big Brain Academy. The questions at hand are numerous: what's with all of these brain games? Is Big Brain as entertaining, addictive, and noticeably effective as Brain Age? Is it really worth another $20 to test the brain again?Big Brain Academy's focus drives away from simply the responsitivity and reactivity of the brain and also focuses on categories like memory, the ability to compute, analyze, and think quickly. There are numerous mini-games availible to test your brain's "size," and the trick here is to come out with the biggest, fattest brain possible.The mini-games in Big Brain Academy are favorable when compared to those in Brain Age. They're a little trickier. For example, one of them called "Coin-parison" asks you to compare two different amounts of coin and select which of the two is more valuable. Of course, you're expected to select one of the two amounts in a matter of seconds, so the game asks a lot of your mind and forces you to think extremely quickly for optimal results. Another example is the game "Flash Memory," where you're forced to very quickly memorize a sequence of numbers and symbols and then duplicate them with an on-screen calculator. I'd say that the learning curve is a little higher here than it was with Brain Age, but only slightly.I discovered that Big Brain Academy not only tests your brain, but also your eyesight. Games like "Flash Memory" and "Shadow Shift," which forces you to identify a character based on its shadow, really test how well you can see what is going on on-screen and interpret it.Big Brain Academy, for the most part, is accurate. After practicing with several of the mini-games, I took my first Big Brain Test and came out with excellent analyzation and memorization skills, but I lacked in computing and thinking quickly. This is pretty accurate to my real-life self, as well as my grade of a B-, which was my high school average.Visually, Big Brain Academy is a prettier, more colorful, and more engaging game than Brain Age. There still isn't much animation, and there is nothing exciting going on on-screen, but it all beats the Times font and gray backgrounds of Brain Age. The music and sound effects are quirky and sound a lot less like something that you'd expect from a brain game.Big Brain Academy is a much better game than Brain Age. There are more mini-games, each testing a specific area of mental activity. The addictive quality remains. The presentation isn't as serious, and looks and sounds much better. Really, the only thing that Big Brain Academy doesn't have when stacked against Brain Age is the abundance of sudoku puzzles. Still, Big Brain Academy is worth your $20, and testing your brain has never been as much fun.
Brain Age is a game that defies its reviews. The game has been getting pretty good numbers but not spectacular. On the other hand, as of May 2nd, Brain Age was the number one selling video game on Amazon across all platforms. My suspicion is that Brain Age will be remembered long into the future for ushering in a new genre of video game in the U.S. This may well be to brain exercise games what Street Fighter was to fighting games, Goldeneye was to first person shooters and Tetris was to puzzle games. It also may elevate neurologists to pop star status. Or maybe not.The point of Brain Age is to exercise your brain just as you might exercise your body. Instead of reducing your heart rate or blood pressure the player (is that the correct word) will aim for a brain age of 20. Each day Brain Age puts the player through a series of exercises that take only a few minutes. The Brain Age is then tracked on a graph to show improvement or regression. You can also compare graphs of multiple players.Brain Age is the only game I have ever seen that is played sideways. In other words you hold it open like you might hold open a book. For left handed players the system can be rotated 180 degrees. All the work is done with the stylus and mic. It took me a little practice to get the writing down. For instance I generally draw a 4 with two motions but the DS seems to require one continuous motion without lifting the stylus. Other people who have played on my system have had problems with 1's coming out as 2's. Letters are even spottier. The word recognition seems to work very well but occasionally misunderstands me.I must admit that I have a handful of issues with the game. First of all the Brain Age scoring seems inconsistent. I've seen some record breaking testing runs get mediocre scores and some average runs get great scores. I swear that I did far better when I earned a 27 than a run where I earned a 22. Some of the tests can be rather annoying, in particular counting from 1 to 120 as fast as you can. My last issue is with the dialog from the game version of Dr. Ryuta Kawashima. After a few weeks of listening to the same phrases over and over again you will want to test the structural integrity of Dr. Kawashima's cranium... with your fists.In the end the worthwhile ness of Brain Age hinges on whether it actually does what it claims to do which is increase memory and improve the functioning of the prefrontal cortex. I must confess that I have my doubts. It reminds me of  people who practice IQ tests and believe their IQ's are going up. The first time I tried `Head Count' I managed a perfect score. My score on `Low to High' has remained fairly steady while I've seen a slow improvement in `Calculations'. However I would attribute most of my success in `Calculations' to improving my ability to draw legible numbers and refreshing my speed at the times tables.If brain testing isn't your thing Brain Age also comes with over 100 Sukoku puzzles that practically make the game worth the twenty dollar cost all by themselves. I look forward to trying some of the other brain games that are scheduled to come out this year because I must admit that the 10 or brain tests on Brain Age are starting to test my patience more than my cerebral cortex.
Thinking. Analyzing. Solving Problems. Reading. Logic. These are just some of the skills that Brain Age will help you develop (or re-develop).No, it's not Resident Evil or Splinter Cell. But it is as fun and addictive; it's certainly as challenging if not more challenging, and it's a nice pallet cleanser from the plethora of pure entertainment value games that my kids and I play.Brain Age is a bit advanced at times for my grade schoolers, but the parts that they do get really help them develop the skills that they are concurrently working on in school. Big Brain Academy is a much easier (not better) alternative for younger children.There's a daily training area that gives your skills a workout. And there's a test area that challenges you to quickly and accurately work through various tasks, then provides you with a calculation of your Brain Age based on how well you did on the test. Sudoku has it's own area to train the brain on number logic.Kids reading this will NO vote me to death for saying this, but this is a great game for parents to get for their kids. It's one of the only ones (Big Brain Academy is the other) that I never take away from my own kids when they've misbehaved or simply just had too much video gaming. They never complain.One word of advice: Brain Age has a hard time recognizing an "8" if you write it the way you'd skate a figure 8; it likes it better when you draw an 8 as two circles on top of each other.Addictive fun. Buy it.
When education is entertaining, it'll be a cold day in hell. Learning algebra, memorizing vocabulary, and writing essays will probably never be fun. But using and training your brain? Could that be useful and entertaining enough to warrant the creation of a video game? Japanese neurologist Ryuta Kawashima, M.D. thinks so. That's why he engineered the budget-priced Nintendo DS brain toy, Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!Brain Age isn't really what I'd consider a video game. It's a tool, a training exercise, and a piece of software that stimulates your brain and tests your responses. There aren't really high scores, there's no story, and there aren't even characters besides the face of Dr. Kawashima, who kindly tells you how to complete each exercise. Really, if you look at it realistically, Brain Age isn't a game at all-it's a tool similar to an educational computer program. If that doesn't excite you, I'm not surprised, but giving Brain Age a chance will reveal its very interesting elements.The point of Brian Age is to provoke and make use of the prefrontal cortex in your brain. If you didn't know (and I don't expect most of you to know anything about neural science), the prefrontal cortex is what lets you use stored knowledge to make decisions in any situation. Quoting the game's official site, it is the "control tower" of your brain. The site also says that your "`practical intelligence,' or ability to apply stored knowledge to your everyday reality, depends upon how well your prefrontal cortex functions." The prefrontal cortex is "the foundation of creativity, memory, communication, and self-control." It's been proven, through Dr. Kawashima's research of the brain's activity and blood flow, that the exercises found in Brain Age can increase the ability to use the prefrontal cortex, thus sharpening your brain.Whether this "training" is an engrossing experience or not depends on your willingness to do math problems or play color-recognition exercises. There are several different exercises, some of them being much more entertaining than others. I, personally, was a sucker for "Calculations 20X", which is a set of 20 simple math problems. The goal of "Calculations" (which also comes in a "100X" flavor) is to complete these math problems as quickly as possible by writing the answer to each equation on the touch screen. You'd be surprised how tricky the game can be-seeing "8X8" and then "8+8" in quick succession can be very confusing and will require you to stop and think for a second before answering. Other fun games include "Head Count", where you count the amount of people entering and exiting a building, and "Lowest to Highest", which is an interesting take on simple memory games.The game I didn't like so much was the "Stroop Test". The "Stroop Test" is a common brain game where the names of colors (like "black" and "yellow") are written in a font color different than what the word actually represents. For example, "blue" might be written in a red font, and there is a slight struggle when saying the color of the font rather than the actual word. The microphone does a terrible job picking up the pronunciation of different colors, and I personally had a really tough time with "blue". This game is actually the only game that does a poor job with recognition of voice or stylus control. Every other game is spot-on.The point of playing these games is to determine your "Brain Age", or the level that your brain thinks at. A healthy Brain Age is 20, which means that your brain operates at a 20-year-old's level, which is evidently the optimal level. Perhaps it's because 20-year-olds haven't yet destroyed their brain with legal alcohol use, but that's a different story.There aren't really graphics or sound effects to mention here. The on-screen visuals are mostly numbers and words without much color, and the backgrounds are all gray or white. Each figure is pretty simple, like the little figures that represent people in "Head Count". Technically, nothing looks bad, but Brain Age is probably the last game ever that will wow you in terms of production values.Even when the exercises get old, 100 sudoku puzzles don't. Sudoku, for those of you unfamiliar with addictive number puzzles, is a game where nine columns and nine rows make 81 squares, and the goal of the game is to fill in a square with a number from 1-9 without repeating any single number in a column or row. There is only one solution to each puzzle, and some of the puzzles can take anywhere from five minutes to an hour to complete, depending on your skill and the amount of numbers granted to you when you begin the puzzle. Sudoku is difficult to do at first but pretty quickly you'll be hooked, and this additional game alone makes Brain Age a fantastic package. Not to mention, a sudoku PSP game was just released and costs more than $20 WITHOUT all of the brain games!Is Brain Age worth buying? Definitely! It's only $20, and I will vouch for Dr. Kawashima that Brain Age does make use of your brain. I had a headache after about an hour of gameplay the first day I got it, but that was mostly because I was replaying "Calculations" and trying to get a lightning-fast time. Doing 800 math problems is bound to do that to your head! Brain Age, if nothing else, is a gadget that further proves the DS' originality and innovation. For that reason alone, it's worth checking out.
I am so happy that Nintendo came up with a game that I can play without me worrying about wasting time. In this game, you will go through a Daily Training. This Daily Training does help stimulate your brain so you are more focus, alert, and clear in your judgment. Math problems and reading are just a few parts of the Training. I personally like the Math challenges because I truly believe it works your memory like no other. I used to have problems articulating what I have in mind. Lately, I've noticed I don't stutter as much and people now find logic at to what I have to say. You need to purchase this game if you are in for a tenacious cognition. Having Brain Age will help you in getting all the knowledge you have stored in your brain to use! Remember that Brain Supplement FOCUS FACTOR? This is the safe alternative to that medication. BRAIN AGE IS THE ONLY BRAIN SUPPLEMENT YOU'LL EVER NEED.

Luigi is delighted to discover he has won a mansion, but is not so enthused to find out it is overrun with  ghosts who have trapped Mario somewhere inside. But the nutty Professor E. Gadd has developed a machine for capturing these creatures, which he calls the Poltergust 3000. With the aid of the Poltergust, Luigi sets off in search of his brother.Inside the mansion Luigi meets the mischievous ghosts who kidnapped his older brother. The ghost's names are cleverly suited to their occupations (the pianist is named ''Melody Pianistonio'' and the artist is called ''Vincent Van Gore'').But while the game is quality, it is a bit light on quantity. Even so, LUIGI'S MANSION is a solid, enjoyable little adventure while it lasts.

What happens when gaming guru, Shigeru  Miyamoto, is oppressed with the role as the integral man for masterminding the next Zelda and Metriod titles?  From the production of Pikmin, it seems as if he seizes a deep, consoling breath and rips open a bag full of relaxation.  Ah, finally all that dreadful anxiety and flagrant expectations from gaming fans everywhere wash away.  His sheer brilliance veers into a jaunty, animated dream world.  Conclusively, he creates a bizarre game where players are ferried  onto a planet where replicas of giant onions come alive and spawn multicolored, cutesy creatures called Pikmin.  Perhaps Miyamoto's latest game is a minor escape from the daunting task of transcending the GameCube into unreachable stratum?  Whatever the case, Pikmin is not what would we ordinarily expect as a first-class launch title, but it doesn't even fall short to deliver one addictive gem.The player assumes the responsibility of Captain Orima who looks like a freshly baked character from Cartoon Network.  With a big, round nose, a mini space outfit, and a fish bowl for a helmet, it's hard not to think about pummeling the daylights outta' the adorable twerp.  Orima's story is basically a cakewalk.  The captain opts to go on vacation through space, in the duration of his flight, he has a sensible meal of onions when a sudden meteor slams onto his rocket.  Surviving the plunge onto an alien planet, Orima's ship has disintegrated into fragments spread across the land.  He must now retrieve the primary ship parts with the aid of the affable and obedient Pikmin before his spacesuit loses function.Playing in Real Time, Pikmin, at the core, is a strategy game.  At the start, the player sets off with a single, trusty Pikmin and is required to feed a three-legged onion with pellets or butchered insects.  After a certain amount of nourishment, the onions plant seeds that'll eventually sprout as Pikmin.  The essential objective to the game is to manage the carrot-shaped Pikmin and lead them on an expedition throughout the planet to recover Captain Orima's missing ship parts.  There are three fundamental breeds of Pikmin, the red ones red are unscathed by fire, the blue ones wade over water, and the yellow ones cart one another and catapult themselves as organic grenades.  Micromanaging elements are also supplemented for good measure.  Bridges are to be constructed for faster mobilization, walls should be demolished for augmented exploration, and strategy preparation must be done to maintain  the life of the Pikmin.  Frequently, goliath-sized vermin like maggots intrude on the Pikmins` progression.  With a whistle command, Captain Orima can order his army to quit their current task, huddle together and unite for a defensive onset.  Also, the Pikmin may proceed in the offensive, attacking a monster when its simply dozing off.  The maximum number of Pikmin a player can shepherd is a grand total of 100 with absolutely no slowdown whatsoever.  Moreover, the game has a time limit.  Working as a clock, the l6 circles atop the screen move from left to right, and once the furthest one is filled, the day draws to a close.  At the end of each day, the Pikmin must rest overnight and an analysis of the player's personal army is evaluated.  Not particularly lengthy, the addicting game can be whizzed within a jiffy of hours.  Crammed with bonus and high score modes, the game retains a good, extended platter of replayability.  What Miyamoto has done is sculpt the GameCube's first true classic.The GameCube's controller, feeling a bit tweaky at first, succeeds to superbly make a first-rate control scheme.  Captain Orima can be directed individually or accompanied with personal escorts.  The analog stick guides Captain Orima, the A button yanks Pikmin from the soil, the B joins Pikmin together, the X is used to distinguish Pikmin groups into separate colors, and the Y button looms the game information and map.  Additionally, the game's camera can be modified in any direction the player fancies, whether it be overhead, side, or the front.The second Pikmin invades the television screen, the player will irrefutably remark on how the graphics are gorgeously crafted or converged with intoxicating vivacity.  From what I have gathered from the many opinions of other gamers, players will either breath in revulsion or approval.  Technology-wise, the rich world of Pikmin is matchless.  With the control of the camera, the player can zoom in and out, screening through the huge landscapes.  Even the tiniest of details will stimulate the players imagination, like the vast region of mountains and shrubbery.  If not enchanting, the game's surroundings adequately present an overall smooth, graphical touch.  From the lighting, various shadowing, and sheer multitude of animation on the creatures, Pikmin is what I imagine as a tingly trip to la-la land.  Ironically, I felt a bit queasy after a few hours on this colorful madness.  While marveling and vacuuming your life on Pikmin, the players will notice how well the music suits this type of genre.  Indolent, tranquil sounds engulf the environment and is deliberately welcomed.  There are the congenial tunes of a pristine day materializing, and the placid kind which hails approaching slumber.  When an antagonistic intruder stumbles upon the Pikmins' camp, the music is swapped into a more rapid, upbeat tempo.  The musical score  proves to be finely executed.  The eccentric yet delightful sounds from the Pikmin, the battle cries, and other noises add deeply to this already remarkable game.Pikmin's basic gist is to genuinely refresh audiences with  entertaining amusement along with hours of nonstop gameplay.  Throughout the game I found myself beaming at the antics of Captain Orima and how ridiculously hilarious the Pikmin behave.  Initially when a tremendous, next-generation home console is released, a monster of a game convoys along, and although,  Nintendo honcho, Shigeru Miyamoto should have unleashed godhood, a Zelda or Star Fox game, Pikmin does not disappoint and is well worth the ownership for the novel, bold GameCube.

Pikmin was created from Zelda's daddy, Shigeru Miyameto. Pikmin is about a guy from Earth who accidently crash-landed on a very strange and unusual planet filled with alien creatures that view the guy nothing less than breakfast, lunch, brunch, dinner, dessert, or a midnight snack. But later on when you look around, you find the "Pikmin", little alien creatures that are attracted to anything that pulls them out from the ground. The Pikmin are as loyal as dogs and will do whatever you order them to do. For example, if you tell them to kill a huge mushroom monster, they'll do it without complaining even if killing it means to get eaten themselves. You must repair your spaceship because the atmosphore is toxic to your little character. The game is intruging and innoventive from the start. People may say it's too kiddy but the game is meant to be played by all generations. (...) So in conclusion, Pikmin proves that Shigeru Miyameto is a mastermind at making video games.
Pikmin was created from Zelda's daddy, Shigeru Miyameto. Pikmin is about a guy from Earth who accidently crash-landed on a very strange and unusual planet filled with alien creatures that view the guy nothing less than breakfast, lunch, brunch, dinner, dessert, or a midnight snack.

Pikmin is one of the first games that came out for Nintendo Gamecube. I remember playing it at my neighbor's house and it was instantly one of my favorite games.It is about seven years later, and owning only a Sega Genesis and an Xbox, I decided that I had to own the Cube. The first game I bought was Pikmin!In Pikmin you play as a very small man named Captain Olimar. His ship crash lands on a planet (Earth, which is never exactly stated but is pretty obvious for numerous reasons). Olimar figures he will die there because important parts to his ship were scattered everywhere and he only has 30 days before his space suit fails and the poisonous oxygen that permeates the planet kills him. Just when it looks like all hope is lost, he stumbles upon a red object that, once he approached, appeared to come alive.The red object he deems an Onion, and out of this onion comes a seed that implants itself into the ground where seconds after a small sprout shoots up. Olimar picks the sprout and that is where the first Pikmin is discovered. It isn't long before Olimar realizes these Pikmin could help him search and gather up the pieces of his ship, and the hunting begins!There are three different kinds of Pikmin and a huge load of enemies looking to eat them. The red Pikmin, the very first Pikmin you acquire, is the strongest out of the three and they are immune to fire. The yellow Pikmin can be thrown very high and far and they can use bomb rocks, which can be found inside tin cans or skulls, to defeat enemies or to knock down rock walls. Last, the blue Pikmin, can go in water without dying.Pikmin is a great game to play and I will continue to enjoy it's awesomeness.
