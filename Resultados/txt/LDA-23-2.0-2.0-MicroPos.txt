Its flawless. It was cheaper than normal, but the condition was pristine so we were very happy! It holds a charge, and the buttons and joy sticks are smooth and do not stick.

Halo 2 is definetely my favorite game for the Xbox system currently. With amazing graphics, gameplay, sound, many weapons, vehicles and the best online play to ever hit the Xbox so far, halo 2 is is the most playable game ever created.Halo 2 has a basic story, its just that Master Chief has returned and is once again trying to stop the covenant from taking over earth and all of the other planets. Master Chief is also trying to deny a weapon of massive power and one that would have a great effect on the world!Even though this game has a simple story, the gameplay is unthinkable. I will break up my review into different categories listed below...Graphics: One of the best parts of Halo 2 is definetely the graphics. The background detail is superb, the texture is smooth and clear. The water is also very well done compared to halo 1, but still not as good as some games have done. The cutscenes are worth bragging about, for example, when i was watching a halo 2 cutscene and my cousin came into the room he told me to "change the channel," as he obviousely thought i was watching television which i thought was kind of funny. The animations of your character reloading, moving and shooting are truely amazing as well, (you switch off from being the covenant and master chief throughout campaign) as it seems like a real movie like a previousely mentioned. Master Chief looks much cooler then he did in Halo 1, as he has a redesigned suit and many more guns with much better graphics. Although it seems like i am saying that the graphics are amazing, i do think that they could have done just a tiny bit of a better job on them just so that it could be one of the best games in terms of graphics to every hit the Xbox Console, that would be great! But all in all, the graphics are wonderful, and definetely not an aspect of the game to complain about, unless you are picky, wait, lemme refrase that, too picky!Gameplay: There is one word, and only one word to describe the gameplay in this game. Fun! Thats it, this is arguably the best game on the xbox console, and there are many reasons to support that.First of all, you are able to sprint at twice the speed that you could in Halo 1. For those of you who play Halo 2 you probobly do not see a difference really in the sprinting aspect. I didn't either when i first played the game, but after i played a lot of halo 2, and then played halo 1, you could definetely see the difference between the two in terms of the speed that you can sprint, which is much better then the first.You are also able to highjack vehicles which gives the game a little "grand theft auto" them to it which is very fun to do. When your playing on Xbox Live, you get a medal each time you highjack a vehicle. (You get medals for each bonus thing you do such as highjacking, sniping, assasinating, etc.) Of course you could not do this in the previous halo 1 game so thats another difference between the two.Another better thing in this game then there was before in the previous one is that the A.I is much smarter. For example, they can sometimes form a "short time alliance" with another enemy and they can swarm at you, or the grunts can hide behind corners and wait for you to come. The elites are also much better at dodging your shots which makes it much harder to hit them. Also, if you want your allies to drive a vehicle they can which you couldn't do in the first halo game. The only problem is that sometimes they don't show that they're smart by slamming into walls and you have to switch seats repetitively before they'll get there "nack" back.But as a result of my gameplay review, it has changed a lot over the long and painful time that it took for the sequel to come out.New Weapons: There are many new weapons in halo to and i will list them underneath. They include...(Keep in mind that the ratings are intirely my opinion)BR55 Battle Rifle: 2x scope, burst shots, all in all its an ok weapon, not the best. Long range: 6/10, Medium range: 6/10, Close range: 6/10Covenant Carbine: Basically the Covenant form of the Battle Rifle except that its not burst, its just a one shot fire. Pretty good though, as it can fire much faster then the battle rifle. Long range: 7/10, Medium range: 8/10, Close range: 8/10Particle Beam Rifle: Covenant form of Sniper rifle, except that if you shoot two shots in a row it has to charge back up which takes a couple seconds, but i think its better then the sniper rifle seeing that if you have a good aim, you can finish your enemy off quickly! (Or ally, ha ha!) Long range: 10/10, Medium range: 8/10, Close range: 6/10. The reason why the ratings decrease is because the closer you are to your enemy, the harder it becomes to shoot considering that your aimer is unbearably small, so its hard to aim, even from a far distance, but it doesn't take that much skill to be able to snipe people from afar.Brute Shot: In my opinion i hate this weapon. Only the brutes use it (in single player) and they can never kill me with it because it sucks. Its almost impossible to aim at anything moving from afar or even medium range. The only good thing is that the shots can bounce of walls, wooooopy! Long range: 1/10, Medium range: 3/10, Close range: 5/10Covenant Energy Sword: Probobly the best weapon for close range is the sword. Even from medium range you can lock on to your target and unleash a super upercut attack which is a one hit kill unless your openent uses a cheap overshield, which i personally think they should take out of the game, seeing that whoever has the overshield cannot be stopped by one person unless the openent has a sword or a rocket launcher. Long range: 0/10, Medium range: 8/10, Close range: 10/10Fuel Rod Gun: Ahhhh, i wish this gun was in multiplayer but i guess it would be way to cheap, considering the amount of ammo it has and that it is a one hit kill. But for single player it works mighty fine! Long range: 10/10, Medium range: 10/10, Close range: 10/10Two other things i have to add is that you can dual weild certain weapons, but the only problem with this is that you cannot chuck grenades when you are dual weilding which kind of makes sense when you think about it. Also, the rocket launchers can lock on to vehicles which makes it much easier to destroy those cheap @$$ vehicle lovers!Vehicles: I will now mention the new vehicles in Halo 2. They are...M12G1 Warthog LAAV- Basically the same as the previous Warthog, except it uses a Gauss Cannon which is a one hit kill instead of the machine gun. (The previous Warthog is in Halo 2 as well.)9/10Specter: Sort of like the Wraith, (Wraiths can be used in multiplayer now) except its faster and can hold three people, one for the plasma cannot turret at the back, one in the side seat, and one obviousely driving the vehicle. 9/10Shadow: The vehicle that the covenant use, can hold up to 8 combatents depending on the species of convenant, an ok vehicle when your using it. It uses a plasma cannon like the rest of the other covenant vehicles. 7/10Two more things i have to add about the vehicles are that the Banshee can now be used in multiplayer as well as the Wraith which makes multipayer much more fun.Sound: A great game needs great audio right? Well halo 2 listened. From the classic halo chant, to the rather heavy halo 2 beat, comes wonderful sound and definetely good enough quality that you can just sit their drinking tea/coffee and listening to it. Well, i guess if your that obsessed with the audio, you can just by the soundrack right?Online: Now comes the best part. The online multiplayer play. I have to say, i though crimson skies had the best online multiplayer play, but as soon as this hit came out i quickly regreted myself saying that. Basically, there are ranked games and unranked games, (unranked games are known as training games.) As you win ranked games you gain levels, you start out at level 1 and the last level is level 50, but i believe that the highest level right now is 27, so as you can see its extremely hard to work your way up once you get past level 20.The different ranked games are as follows...Rumble Pit: Up to 8 players all dualing it out against each other. Thit matchmake playlist can include normal slayer, all rockets, all swords, all shotguns, odball, or king of the hill. This is probobly my favorite kind of playlist to play.Team Skirmish: Up to 8 players, 4 on 4, on a team obviousely. This playlist usually includes the different types of Capture the Flag, team odball, 3 plots or assault. Pretty fun playlist to play!Team Slayer: 8 players, 4 on 4 against each other can include normal team slayer, team rockets, team swords, Fiesta Team slayer, team shotguns or team phantoms. Probobly runner up for my favorite playist to play halo 2 on.Head to Head: Simple straight up slayer games 1 v 1 can inlcude normal slayer, all swords or all rifles. Very fun, and addicting especially when your winning.Big team battle: Huge game, up to 16 players, 8 v 8 can include team slayer, different types of CTF, Assault, or land grab where you have to take over different areas of land. Very fun playlist as it sounds like, but can get very hard and boring considering that your dying a whole tun, especially when your playing on a smaller map.Clan Battles: Basically, you can join a clan which in different words is like a club and you get your clan together and battle with them in different match types. Pretty fun, good for bragging rights. When your clan starts winning, it will level up.In conclusion to my online review and whole halo 2 review, the online aspect is probobly the best part of this entire game. Its so much fun trash talking to your opponents and so addicting to play ranked games. You can also just play custom games where you can invite all your friends to play whatever type/map you want. You can also customize ever thinkable option which makes this game truely worth your time and money.Halo 2 delivers excellent gameplayer/graphics/sound/online play which definetely makes the game a worthy $50. Halo 2 is definetely not one of those games that you are going to end up returning straight away after you get it, you'll be twice as addicted to it as you were to Halo 1!

Halo 2 is definetely my favorite game for the Xbox system currently. With amazing graphics, gameplay, sound, many weapons, vehicles and the best online play to ever hit the Xbox so far, halo 2 is is the most playable game ever created.Halo 2 has a basic story, its just that Master Chief has returned and is once again trying to stop the covenant from taking over earth and all of the other planets. Master Chief is also trying to deny a weapon of massive power and one that would have a great effect on the world!Even though this game has a simple story, the gameplay is unthinkable. I will break up my review into different categories listed below...Graphics: One of the best parts of Halo 2 is definetely the graphics. The background detail is superb, the texture is smooth and clear. The water is also very well done compared to halo 1, but still not as good as some games have done. The cutscenes are worth bragging about, for example, when i was watching a halo 2 cutscene and my cousin came into the room he told me to "change the channel," as he obviousely thought i was watching television which i thought was kind of funny. The animations of your character reloading, moving and shooting are truely amazing as well, (you switch off from being the covenant and master chief throughout campaign) as it seems like a real movie like a previousely mentioned. Master Chief looks much cooler then he did in Halo 1, as he has a redesigned suit and many more guns with much better graphics. Although it seems like i am saying that the graphics are amazing, i do think that they could have done just a tiny bit of a better job on them just so that it could be one of the best games in terms of graphics to every hit the Xbox Console, that would be great! But all in all, the graphics are wonderful, and definetely not an aspect of the game to complain about, unless you are picky, wait, lemme refrase that, too picky!Gameplay: There is one word, and only one word to describe the gameplay in this game. Fun! Thats it, this is arguably the best game on the xbox console, and there are many reasons to support that.First of all, you are able to sprint at twice the speed that you could in Halo 1. For those of you who play Halo 2 you probobly do not see a difference really in the sprinting aspect. I didn't either when i first played the game, but after i played a lot of halo 2, and then played halo 1, you could definetely see the difference between the two in terms of the speed that you can sprint, which is much better then the first.You are also able to highjack vehicles which gives the game a little "grand theft auto" them to it which is very fun to do. When your playing on Xbox Live, you get a medal each time you highjack a vehicle. (You get medals for each bonus thing you do such as highjacking, sniping, assasinating, etc.) Of course you could not do this in the previous halo 1 game so thats another difference between the two.Another better thing in this game then there was before in the previous one is that the A.I is much smarter. For example, they can sometimes form a "short time alliance" with another enemy and they can swarm at you, or the grunts can hide behind corners and wait for you to come. The elites are also much better at dodging your shots which makes it much harder to hit them. Also, if you want your allies to drive a vehicle they can which you couldn't do in the first halo game. The only problem is that sometimes they don't show that they're smart by slamming into walls and you have to switch seats repetitively before they'll get there "nack" back.But as a result of my gameplay review, it has changed a lot over the long and painful time that it took for the sequel to come out.New Weapons: There are many new weapons in halo to and i will list them underneath. They include...(Keep in mind that the ratings are intirely my opinion)BR55 Battle Rifle: 2x scope, burst shots, all in all its an ok weapon, not the best. Long range: 6/10, Medium range: 6/10, Close range: 6/10Covenant Carbine: Basically the Covenant form of the Battle Rifle except that its not burst, its just a one shot fire. Pretty good though, as it can fire much faster then the battle rifle. Long range: 7/10, Medium range: 8/10, Close range: 8/10Particle Beam Rifle: Covenant form of Sniper rifle, except that if you shoot two shots in a row it has to charge back up which takes a couple seconds, but i think its better then the sniper rifle seeing that if you have a good aim, you can finish your enemy off quickly! (Or ally, ha ha!) Long range: 10/10, Medium range: 8/10, Close range: 6/10. The reason why the ratings decrease is because the closer you are to your enemy, the harder it becomes to shoot considering that your aimer is unbearably small, so its hard to aim, even from a far distance, but it doesn't take that much skill to be able to snipe people from afar.Brute Shot: In my opinion i hate this weapon. Only the brutes use it (in single player) and they can never kill me with it because it sucks. Its almost impossible to aim at anything moving from afar or even medium range. The only good thing is that the shots can bounce of walls, wooooopy! Long range: 1/10, Medium range: 3/10, Close range: 5/10Covenant Energy Sword: Probobly the best weapon for close range is the sword. Even from medium range you can lock on to your target and unleash a super upercut attack which is a one hit kill unless your openent uses a cheap overshield, which i personally think they should take out of the game, seeing that whoever has the overshield cannot be stopped by one person unless the openent has a sword or a rocket launcher. Long range: 0/10, Medium range: 8/10, Close range: 10/10Fuel Rod Gun: Ahhhh, i wish this gun was in multiplayer but i guess it would be way to cheap, considering the amount of ammo it has and that it is a one hit kill. But for single player it works mighty fine! Long range: 10/10, Medium range: 10/10, Close range: 10/10Two other things i have to add is that you can dual weild certain weapons, but the only problem with this is that you cannot chuck grenades when you are dual weilding which kind of makes sense when you think about it. Also, the rocket launchers can lock on to vehicles which makes it much easier to destroy those cheap @$$ vehicle lovers!Vehicles: I will now mention the new vehicles in Halo 2. They are...M12G1 Warthog LAAV- Basically the same as the previous Warthog, except it uses a Gauss Cannon which is a one hit kill instead of the machine gun. (The previous Warthog is in Halo 2 as well.)9/10Specter: Sort of like the Wraith, (Wraiths can be used in multiplayer now) except its faster and can hold three people, one for the plasma cannot turret at the back, one in the side seat, and one obviousely driving the vehicle. 9/10Shadow: The vehicle that the covenant use, can hold up to 8 combatents depending on the species of convenant, an ok vehicle when your using it. It uses a plasma cannon like the rest of the other covenant vehicles. 7/10Two more things i have to add about the vehicles are that the Banshee can now be used in multiplayer as well as the Wraith which makes multipayer much more fun.Sound: A great game needs great audio right? Well halo 2 listened. From the classic halo chant, to the rather heavy halo 2 beat, comes wonderful sound and definetely good enough quality that you can just sit their drinking tea/coffee and listening to it. Well, i guess if your that obsessed with the audio, you can just by the soundrack right?Online: Now comes the best part. The online multiplayer play. I have to say, i though crimson skies had the best online multiplayer play, but as soon as this hit came out i quickly regreted myself saying that. Basically, there are ranked games and unranked games, (unranked games are known as training games.) As you win ranked games you gain levels, you start out at level 1 and the last level is level 50, but i believe that the highest level right now is 27, so as you can see its extremely hard to work your way up once you get past level 20.The different ranked games are as follows...Rumble Pit: Up to 8 players all dualing it out against each other. Thit matchmake playlist can include normal slayer, all rockets, all swords, all shotguns, odball, or king of the hill. This is probobly my favorite kind of playlist to play.Team Skirmish: Up to 8 players, 4 on 4, on a team obviousely. This playlist usually includes the different types of Capture the Flag, team odball, 3 plots or assault. Pretty fun playlist to play!Team Slayer: 8 players, 4 on 4 against each other can include normal team slayer, team rockets, team swords, Fiesta Team slayer, team shotguns or team phantoms. Probobly runner up for my favorite playist to play halo 2 on.Head to Head: Simple straight up slayer games 1 v 1 can inlcude normal slayer, all swords or all rifles. Very fun, and addicting especially when your winning.Big team battle: Huge game, up to 16 players, 8 v 8 can include team slayer, different types of CTF, Assault, or land grab where you have to take over different areas of land. Very fun playlist as it sounds like, but can get very hard and boring considering that your dying a whole tun, especially when your playing on a smaller map.Clan Battles: Basically, you can join a clan which in different words is like a club and you get your clan together and battle with them in different match types. Pretty fun, good for bragging rights. When your clan starts winning, it will level up.In conclusion to my online review and whole halo 2 review, the online aspect is probobly the best part of this entire game. Its so much fun trash talking to your opponents and so addicting to play ranked games. You can also just play custom games where you can invite all your friends to play whatever type/map you want. You can also customize ever thinkable option which makes this game truely worth your time and money.Halo 2 delivers excellent gameplayer/graphics/sound/online play which definetely makes the game a worthy $50. Halo 2 is definetely not one of those games that you are going to end up returning straight away after you get it, you'll be twice as addicted to it as you were to Halo 1! (Unless you don't have Xbox, and if you don't like halo, no offence, but theres something wrong with you.)COLLECTORS EDITION:With collectors edition, you get a ton of new features which includes a cooler looking game case, a "behind the scenes" footage of halo 2 and how this amazing game was made.

What can I say this game is just plainly awesome, and anything I could say wouldn't even describe the feeling of playing this game. If you loved Halo and FPS games you'll love this. Halo 2 takes place after the events on Halo.CAMPAIGN MODE:Campaign mode is really fun, with an awesome story; with all kinds of twists and turns. The campaign modes reveal new charters like the Prophets; leaders of the Covenant, as well as the Brutes, which is more of an enforcer that relies on Agression, and Buggers which are incests that use their speed and agility, and mass in numbers to try in their attacks. Also you you will encounter the Honor guard, which are Elites with tricked out body armor, and they have also given the Jackals a new look. Their are loads of new weapons and toys to play around with:Weapons-CampaignLike the new /Covenant Beam Rifile/- Which is the Covenant sniper Rifle mostly used by Jackals, super effective against every thing instant kill with head shot.You also have the new/ Battle Rifile/- Which is a new good looking rifile with a zoom that can fire three round burst at a time, whihc is very effective mid-close range combat.You also can now wield the/ Covenant Energy Sword/- Which is one heck of a weapon for people who like combat close and personal. Great for stealth I must say with two differet attacks basic mele and critical strike.I also loved the new/ Covenant Carbine/- Which is a very effective plasma semi automatic rifle which is ver effective on mid to long range targets, ggreat toy, more of a fall back weapon though like the Battle Rifile.They also have an new/ Sentile Beam/- Whihc is a weapon you will encounter latter in the game great against fllod along with the shotgun, and Plasma Sword. Shoots out beam similar to the flying sentlies you encounter.You also have a new gernade launcher called the/- Brute Shot/- which can shoot out gernades at a rapid speed. Good for shelling a group of enemies. You can deflect the gernades off walls to hit targets to, a sweet trick that you can use in latter levels of the game.In the game they have created the brand new, DUAL WIELD system, which makes it possible to wield two weapons at a time in different effictive combos, which opens the doors to all new possibiltes.Weapons/Dual Wield-Campaign/SMG/-A new sub machine gun that is very effective, especially when dual wield in different combos, an ideal weapon for close quaters combat. Probably the best weapon choice for efficient killing./Brute Plasma Rifle/-Just like the original, except it's red and called the Brute plama rifle no difference, except for Butes only use it.Just as great as the original./Magnum/- I really didn't like how they took the zoom, off the pistol, but it can be used in alot of effective combos like the the famous SMG and Magnum combo.So you can basically throughout the game use combos with all the weapons for example:Plasma Rifle and NeedlerSMG and Pistol(Magnum)Needler and SMGBrute Plasma Rifile and Plasma RifleSMG and SMGNeedler and NeedlerB.Plasma Rifle and NeedlerPlasma Rifle and Plasma RiflePlasma Pistol and Plasma RifleGraphis/New Changes:... well you get the point the new dual wield system really adds something to the combat. Oh, yeah The Rocket Launcher is now more of an heat seeker, than randomly firing at stuff, way more effective, and they have gave the game a whole new look with graphics ten times better than the original.They have also added destroyable environments like vechile damage, and such. A way better physics engine as well. To be honest the graphics are the best I've see to date.In campaign mode you also have new vechiles like:Other Toys-Campaign:/The Scarb/: Kind of like one of those Imperial Walkers from "Star Wars", That the Covenant has,  very powerful with a powerful laser blast./The Wraith/: A new Covenant motar tank, that is a pretty sweet toy to play with, but is not as effective as the scorpion tank, but does have a speed boost, which the also added to the Ghosts/The Spectre/: The Covenant version of a Warhog, can fit up to 3 passengers along with a driver and gunner fun, in multiplayer action, you don't use it as much in the campaign./The Guass Warhog/: A new vesion of the warhog with mor or a plasma type particle canon einstead of the basic machine gun. great new toy, but best used in multi player./Shadow/: A basic covenant troop transport vechile featured in the game can carry multible passanger as well as cargo, such as a ghost.Instead of drop ships that the original game had, Halo 2 features/Phantoms/ which are kind of like the covenant version of the Pillar of Autumn, used for dropping off troops and supplies at tatical points as well as good for doing som serios carnage.Campaign Overview:As you can see they have added a lot in the the game. Campaign Mode has 15 level, with brilliant landscapes, and unbelivable graphics, with a twist. You play as the Master Chief for part of the game, but you will also play part of the game as a Covenat elite called the Arbiter, this will give you more of the Covenant's side of he story. The game has a lot more depth than the original, and is way more advanced as well!!! Overall Campaign mode is fairly easy until you try Heroic, but will keep you busy for about 15 hours.Some people didn't like the ciff hanger ending so they said the game was rushed, how naive can some people be, the end just leads into Halo 3 which will be coming out with the new Xbox 360. I honestly wanted more after the end of the game, but really I don't like people who try to find something wrong with the game and make such a big deal about it. Halo 2 is a materpiece no doubt about it. The game is what all sci fi movies should be like. Hey I even heard they are coming out with a Halo movie, so watch out in the future.Multi- PlayerYes, Campaign mode is fun, but thee multi player fun is what really makes this game shine, whether it's from split screen action, to co op adventure, or playing against the world on Xbox Live whihc is darn fun. I got new for you the multi player will have you playing this game for hours for example.For example after school one day after I fininshed my homework, at 5:00 PM I started to have some fun playing on Xbox live, so I played and played, so when When I looked at the clock it was 2:00 AM, The game was so fun I played for another hour than I decide to go to bed. So, ipractilly become addicted to it. Lan parties are nice too link up with 15 other people and have some a good time and show your fiends what true marksmanship is all about.Halo 2 has a whole bunch of new maps, that ae very detailed and are so darn fun, with all the new weapons and such. The possiblites are endless. You can form your own tournments and so on and so forth. Multi player is what makes this game really fun. It's just darn addictive. You can eve customize your profile, which makes the game really cool.WHAT MAKES THE SPECIAL EDITION SO SPECIAL:If you are asking if you should go out and spend your money on the special edition, I say yeah go ahead. You get a second disc with "The Making of Halo 2" along with some great reading meterial from the Covenant's point of view, along with the cool silver case. Look, it is only a few bucks more so I say get your money's worth.Well, you don't have too,... if you don't want too and you want to save about a few bucks, but on Amazon. com they have it on sale anyway for about $40.00, at the current moment, so I really suggest you if you're an amazon shopper and you did not buy this game go ahead to. Either way it's still the same game special edition or not.OVERALL:Overall, this is the best game of 2004-2005 in my opinion. Great game, a must buy for an FPS fan, great sequel to Halo. This game gets a 5/5.... outstanding game, bring on part 3!!!-Rogue Fox"Rogue"

From the people who brought us Knights of the Old Republic comes another genre-blending game with a fabulously twisting plot.  If you own an Xbox, you should own this game.  It is not only the best Action RPG on the Xbox but one of the best RPGs played in recent memory.For those who have played KOTOR, this game will be instantly familiar.  At the offset, you pick a character and are thrust into a world of moralities.  Unlike KOTOR, the morality system is a little more complex for the most part.  Instead of focusing on good and evil, your character has the choice of being endlessly helpful, understanding and tolerant of everyone (in other words believes in the power of the human spirit) or someone who reveres strength.  As an example of this strength concept, there is a decision early on about a dam that is open and has caused problems for a town because the sailors are land locked.  A wine merchant wants the dam to remain open so he can make a killing off of the sailors.  If you follow the Way of the Open Palm you would probably close the dam so that the town can prosper in what is should be doing.  If you follow the Way of the Closed Fist, on the other hand, would decide that if the town were strong they will survive this current hurdle and that it is only that, a hurdle.  It gets a little more tricky than that and does open some areas for roleplaying your character and deciding what you would really do in that situation.  Bioware is also wonderful at making you think about your decision as they give you new information just as soon as you make a decision that might change how you feel about the situation.My only complaint with the system is that while they say that the two paths are different from looking at things as good and evil, there are still some instances where there is a "good" and an "evil" way of doing things.  I might have rationalized why I would be doing something that way, yet I would get points from the side I didn't want because it was clearly delineated as "good and evil choice."  So, that's a bit frustrating given that their system isn't supposed to be good and evil.  But, overall the system works well and really makes you think.I didn't really care for KOTOR because of the battle system and that is probably the reason I'm enjoying Jade Empire much more.  The fighting system is simple yet deep.  As you progress you will learn different martial arts style that you can map to the D-pad for quick and easy access.  And you will be constantly changing your styles as the techniques to defeat enemies will constantly evolve.  Some monsters are immune to certain attacks so you will have to experiment and find the best ways of devastating your foes.On the simple side, the combat is really about rock, paper scissors.  You have a quick attack and a time-consuming attack (and a knock back attack that really only helps when you are surrounded and need some space).  When someone blocks you use your time consuming attack, otherwise you mostly use your quick attacks to offset their own long attacks.  It's pretty simple and easy to used to.  However, some battles can become a button masher either way you look at it.  But it's still exhilarating and fast with many ways of deciding how you want to play.  Do you want to focus on using weapons, martial arts, magic, transformations?  A little of the above?  It's all up to you.The game is beautiful most of the time.  The art style is impeccable and really helps create a full-flesh universe.  Since it's based on oriental myth, it doesn't take place in the Orient as we know it but a mythical world that incorporates themes from oriental culture.  Because of this, the desiginers are free to create whatever their imagination can make.  And it's beautiful.  There are some places that I stood for awhile and just looked because it was so surreally beautiful and soothing.  It made me wish that sometimes our world wasn't so industrialized and that we could go back to what was a more simple beauty.  It was that affecting.  However, sometimes, the backgrounds look painted on.  Some of the hills and areas that act as blockades for where you can't go aren't that well designed.  Also my character's body type makes me laugh because his pecs are super large and his abs are indented in his body that I laugh whenever I see it.The game moves impeccably fast as well.  Your character runs and I mean runs through the areas.  The framerate is great.  But, like KOTOR before it, the game stutters sometimes when you are running and turning the camera.  When the camera pans, the game flutters sometimes as it tries to take in everything that happens.  In battles, the game hardly ever stutters.  And the battles can end up having a good dozen or so enemies fighting you and your partner so they can get pretty hectic and the graphics engine does a great job keeping the motion moving.Aurally, the game is a treat.  You will find some cameo voice actors that are immediately familiar (look for John Cleese in a hysterical role).  The music is well done and has a wonderful oriental bent to it (of course).  Also, Bioware hired a real linguist to help create the fictional language used in the game.  It is very familiar to oriental language but isn't real.  It was created solely for this game.  And that's amazing.Unfortunately, my problem with the dialogue in the game is the same problem I had with KOTOR.  It's great and all but all too often the plot developments and dialogue becomes a "talking head" type situation where anyone who has something important to say gets a close up of their face while their lips move and the dialogue is heard.  This is unfortunate for me because I get impatient sometimes and will just read the subtitles and skip through most of their dialogue.  It's never "dynamic" in cutscenes like in some RPGs I've played (hands down the best use of dialogue in an RPG goes to FFX that used dialogue to move the plot but it wasn't a novel dialogue; it was more of a movie dialogue).  The dialogue in Jade Empire is sometimes like a novel.  So, for those who aren't interested in talking heads delivering dialogue this might get annoying after a time.  But the dialogue is genuinely well voiced and excellent.My only other complaint is the load times.  While not as annoying constant as Fable where each and every small zone no matter how small had to be loaded for a good 5-10+ seconds, it still is a pain when you have to go through zones for a quest.  For instance, in the beginning of the game you have to go through the town to the school (a load screen) to get a quest, go back to town (load screen) to talk to someone, then back to the school (load screen).  And it's unfortunate because the actual quest takes maybe a minute, but a good 20 seconds of the time is spent in load screens.  That's a uncharacteristic load time though as generally the areas are big and don't usually require many loads.  Although another incident where it is very noticeable is in an arena combat situation where before and after each arena battle it has to load for a good 5-10 seconds.  The kicker is, some of the arena battles are over in about a minute or much much less and yet you have to deal with two load screens comprising a good 10-20 seconds.  So, in some areas it can be annoying and definitely pulls you out of the game when you should be pulled further in.  And, it becomes especially annoying considering that games like Halo 2 are seamless after the original load.Overall, though, this game is gold.  It's perfectly plotted and paced and has Bioware's trademark in excellence stamped all over it.  It ranks as one of my favorite games this year so far along with God of War and Psychonauts.  I would definitely recommend buying this game.  There are some problems that I have noted but you know regardless of the problems, this is an excellent game with an excellent story.  And, at 22+ hours, this adventure is worth taking.**NOTE: You should definitely pick up this, the Limited Edition of it if you can still find it.  For the initial run they are all Limited Edition and after they are gone, you will only be able to get the standard game.  The Limited edition has a new character and weapon and a making of as well as some other fun things.  Same price, so definitely check this one out if you want the game.
I had this game on preorder for nearly a year, and when it came out I purchased the HALO 2 special edition box that came with, the tin case and two CD's one with the game on it, and one with a DVD showing the making of Halo 2. I was also told that there would be a CD with the Halo 2 soundtrack. When I first opened the tin case, I expected a separate place to store each CD, however, the two CD's were stored in the same place on top of each other. Not a big deal, but its kind of cheap that they would do that. Also there is no soundtrack in the special edition case.Overall Halo 2 is a very good game, but not as good as the original in my opinion.  I originally thought this game was painfully boring, but the later levels in this game were in fact very fun and involving.  I just wish it could have been a little longer and also the middle levels to be as fun as the last ones.Graphics: The best part of this game is the graphics. The graphics in Halo 2 are much clearer and crisper than the original, and is the best of my XBOX collection. If you don't look hard enough, you will think that you are watching a movie. The characters and textures in this game are rendered near perfectly and also the lighting effects were done very well.  The scenery looks almost lifelike especially when you are outside.  These are the best graphics I have seen in a game ever in my opinion.  Graphics get a perfect 10.Sound: The sound in this game is also very well done; the biggest disappointment here however is that the sounds of the guns do not have the "punch" as the weapons from the original game. Everything sounds like a BB gun, the only gun that sounds pretty good is the sniper rifle. The voiceovers are a nice touch and I like them fairly well. Even though some of the Covenant voiceovers are cheesy. The music is also pretty well done, but falls a bit short of the original game.Gameplay: This is what hurts the game the most.  Bungie did not do a good job of getting you involved in the game on the first and middle levels. I mean you are there, but you don't feel like you are there. The game does not really have any distinct mission goals and is basically a shoot everything that moves game. There is no shortage of enemies you will often find you run out of bullets and have to run around picking up guns off the ground. The annoying flood is back and they are still very annoying, they even made those flood "bugs" stronger, and they will kill you if you don't shoot them. In the first Halo, you could just let them pop off of you and your shield will only be damaged a little. Now if you do that, you shield will go down fast and you will die fast. Another annoying thing about the game play is that you have no idea how much energy you have left once you loose your shield, expect a lot of "random" deaths because you just don't expect something just brushing up against you to kill you. The middle levels are looooong, repetitive and boring. Good thing you can save at anytime your last checkpoint so you don't have to sit at the TV for an hour just to complete one level.  However, like I mentioned earlier, the later levels are very fun to play and once I got past the last boring level in the game, I played Halo all the time.Another thing I must mention about the game is that I really don't like how the game switches control between the Master Chief and a Covenant arbiter. It sucks and makes the game a bit confusing.  The corniest part of the game is that every character can drive every vehicle, yep, Covenant can ride in Scorpions in the human warthog. If you think that is bad then please let me finish, the flood too can ride in human and covenant vehicles. They can't walk straight or barely shoot, but they have enough dexterity to operate a tank or jeep? Please!! Get the hell out of here!!! When I first saw a warthog driving towards me shooting at me, I thought it was the covenant, but when it got closer, I saw it was the flood riding 3 deep in the warthog! One in the driver's seat, one in the passenger seat and one in operating the turret!! When I first saw that I nearly burst out laughing, it had to be funniest thing I seen in a video game in a long time.I pushed through the boring levels, and was very impressed with the final ones.  However the ending was very disappointing.  I could not believe it was over that quick.  In fact, when I first beat the game, for some reason my XBOX did not play the credits, and I was returned the to main menu after a final cut scene, so I played the final part of the game again, and this time I did get the credits.  I just stared at the screen in disbelief, as I could not believe that this game was over so quickly.  On top of that, it leaves you hanging, I guess that was Microsoft's idea, in order to get even more anticipation for Halo 3, which almost certainly will come out based on Halo 2's ending!I am pretty satisfied with the game overall, does it live up to the hype?  Not in my opinion, but it still is a great game.  I originally said I hated it, but I am glad I did give it a chance.I don't plan to play on XBOX live because it is saturated with immature kids who act stupid and mess up the game.  Not to mention all the lame cheaters on XBOX Live.  In fact I am going to cancel my subscription before it renews next year!

Well Halo is a great game.But It's too short not too short in a bad way only because I wanted more and YES I played it on HEROIC level.  The graphics are pretty good.I like the distant look of the planets and the whole feel of the game. The movie cutscenes are a little on the choppy side but still look nice and the sound and voice acting are solid.Some of the levels are inside ,not like like the first halo where mostly your outside. I love the sniper level with the water falls,it's pretty hard sometimes you get killed with one shot. The only way to play this game is on the HEROIC ,or LEGENDARY level. That really helped it last longer. The first encounter with the FLOOD enemies was intense ,seriously 10 times harder than on normal setting.The enemies do seem to get smarter on the harder levels.They seemed to hide better behind boxes and walls etc. The graphics arent "splinter cell" quality,but still some good eye candy. I would like to see this game made into an epic movie.The sound is pretty good .If your not gonna go online or use the multiplayer from this game,you might wanna rent it,don't even buy it,unless your a collector or dont mind the price.Just rent it and beat it before your rental date is due ,believe me ,it's possible. I played it on Heroic level and it was a fun challenge very tough enemies sometimes I would lay like 300 SMG  bullets and they were still standing there looking at me like what ? thats all you got? Then I'D empty all my doulbe fisted needler bullets into them ,that took care of em.I suggest you ONLY and I mean ONLY play this game on HEROIC or LEGENDARY if you think this game is easy and short.Try LEGENDARY mode ,then tell me its easy. Multiplayer levels,and online looks like what this game is a good buy for.But if your gonna just play single player campaign ,just rent it and beat it in a week,although Im still not done playing it on LEGENDARY mode and I got it the day it came out,it's now 11-20-04. All in all HALO2 is a great FPS game,that was just impossible to live up to all the hype.Much like FABLE was. But still a SOLID  game ,but for the price of HALO2 why can't they make it last a little longer ? Like MORROWIND or KOTOR? For single player I'd rate it an 9 out of 10.Only because its nobody's perfect.And the special edition version THEY PUT BOTH DISKS ON TOP OF EACH OTHER? WHY? why couldn't they make an extra space like some dvd movies with two disks? You know one on the left ,one on the right? instead they stacked the bonus disk right underneath the game disk ,with no seperate holder.I had to be careful not to scratch my game disk. UGH...In conclusion HALO2 is a fun game. with nice graphics and very tough enemies,on the HEROIC and especially on the LEGENDARY setting.The enemies would actually change there strategies based on my actions on these difficulty settings.HALO2 IS THE BEST CONSOLE FPS AS OF NOV 20TH 2004. AT LEAST UNTIL DOOM3 COMES OUT.I totally agree with (A.SINGH) comments about this game. If you play it on NORMAL setting ,this game is easy and short. Try it on HEROIC or even harder LEGENDARY mode. This game lasts 10 times longer and you have more time to take in all the scenery .Not to mention tons and tons of more tough as nails enemies. I unloaded two complete SMG double fisted clips into this enemy and he was stilll standing. Can you handle it? This is a MATURE rated game for people over 17.EBAY ??why are kids rating this game? there saying its too short ,it's too easy,yeah if you play it on easy  or normal setting.I think they shouldv'e made normal mode HEROIC mode and call it normal mode.Then there wouldnt be so many complants about it being too short.(NORMAL) setting and (HEROIC) setting are two different games PERIOD.aND LEGENDARY mode is frickin severly intense.I do agree the ending was a bit shabby,Where's the hero MASTER CHEIF?but you have too watch entire credits to see the little xtra ending. I wish also if you beat the game on HEROIC you get like bonus ammo or unlimited cammo,something man.Now Im on legendary mode and I'm constantly in need of ammo,in some areas.whereas the enemies  have an unlimited supply. Im up agaist like 100 enemies at once.give me some more ammo.Also in the civil war type part of the game I felt more like a spectactor than the main character.If I wanted to watch a DVD I'd rent one.HALO2 STILL ROCKS WITH ALL IT'S very small flaws.

Madden 2002 is a very good football game that falls just a little short of five stars.  I like the game an awful lot and have played a great deal (over 100 games (15 minute quarters of course) so far and will play a lot more) but there are some flaws.  In no particular order...The graphics in Madden are really nothing special.  They aren't terrible and the player animations during the game are nice, but the backdrops are dull and all too often you see players walk right through each other in the after play animations.Not nearly enough work was put into the experience of playing defense.  Madden has a very nice training mode for offensive plays which really carefully explains everything from blocking assignments to reading pass coverage.  There is also a sometimes nifty &quot;Ask Madden&quot; feature in offensive playcalling in which the game will reccomend offensive plays when prompted and even provide some reasoning for the choice but there is no such feature for defense.  You are pretty much on your own when it comes to calling plays on defense beyond the vague reccomendation in the EAsy play mode that you run 4-3 against the run and Nickel or Dime against the pass.  But that doesn't help explain the subtle differences between and 4-3 &quot;Thunder&quot; and a 4-3 &quot;Lightning&quot;.  Which is better against short yardage running plays?  Which is better against play action or screens?  You can get some ideas from looking at the small diagram of the play, but on the whole there is a lot lacking in defensive play calling.It is far too easy to run the football.  Running blindly won't work; but if you pay attention to the way the play is diagramed and follow your blocks, it isn't hard to rush for 250 yards on 20 to 30 carries in every game against the hardest difficulty setting (All Madden) with all the defensive AI settings cranked up as high as they go.  In contrast it is far too hard to pass the ball.  You really must read the defense and go through progressions (just throwing to your primary reciever or throwing to the same reciever over and over will not work) and that's quite fun, but recievers will drop balls way, way too often no matter how softly (or how hard) you throw the ball.  And if your reciever does not have the coverage beat by at least two steps the pass will be tipped or intercepted about half the time as defensive backs controlled by the computer seem to be blessed with superhuman closing speed.Another minor annoyance is the announcing.  Madden and Summerall are clear and conversational, but a lot of their comments are very out of place.  For example, five minutes into the first quarter you get the ball for the first time down a field goal and you run the ball for your first play.  Summerall will announce, shocked &quot;These guys still think they have time to establish the run!&quot;  And Madden, the sage, will respond, &quot;When you're down like this, it's time to put your faith in your quarterback.&quot;  Um, yeah.Finally, it is very hard to play fair, realistic football.  The first three difficulty levels are so easy once you get the basic controls down that it is no trouble at all to win by anywhere from five to ten touchdowns...and that's no fun.  The only level that can challenge you at all is All Madden and it does that by openly cheating.  The opposing defensive line will slice through your pass protection like a battle axe through butter without ever having to blitz, their receivers never drop balls (and, indeed, their defensive line has better hands than your best receiver), the computer's pass protection is near perfect unless you blitz with two extra men.  You will be penalized two or three times as often as the other team (and after about half of your big plays).  I think this could be fixed up some by forcing the computer to play fair (instead of cheating in the most blatant of ways) but then also teaching it how to play against the run a little better so you can't just run them over every game.Despite what it may sound like so far in the review, I really do think Madden 2002 is a fantastic game.  I really like the momentum based physics system and the game does a better job than any other of capturing the *feel* of real football (with the exception of the poor AI run defense).  The game comes with a ton of options in all its formats.  In its franchise mode you can create players, draft players, sign free agents, trade, progress players from poorly rated rookies to top notch stars over a few seasons, etc.  In season mode you can even edit the attribues of existing players (something I found necessary to make some of the players better match their real life counterparts (Mike Vick running slower than most fullbacks was just wrong, for example)).  This is actually a really neat option as it allows you to play the game you're in the mood for.  If you want a real high scorer, go in an jack up both teams offenses.  If you want a real low scorer, go in and pump up the defenses, etc.  There is a robust practice modes (although you can't practice with created or edited teams, which is annoying).  There is also a nice situation mode and a mini-game: the 2 minute drill (go in with any team against any team and see how many points you can score in 2 minutes).  Another nice feature are the Madden Cards.  You can earn challenge points for scoring in the 2 minute drill or for completing &quot;challenges&quot; in a regular game (i.e. throw for 300 yds, etc.) and use these points to buy packs of cheat cards that open up hidden teams and stadiums, boost current players and bring old ones out of retirement, or change other game conditions.In summary, if you like football games, go ahead and get this one.  You'll have a lot of fun with it (especially against friends) but don't expect perfection.  I hope I haven't turned anyone off of the game with some of my rants, but I also hope someone from EA Sports reads this and makes the appropriate adjustments.

Excelente control de mando, me hacia falta uno para tener dos de estos en mi consola y poder disfrutar de los juegos en grupo.!! estoy muy contento de tener otro de estos..!!

i bought this product for the metal casing. it wasnt what i expected. its metal, but it was all rusty and it wasnt taken care of very well. i hope that when you get one of your own, its better. the disk itself playes very well though.
