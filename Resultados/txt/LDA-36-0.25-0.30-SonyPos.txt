Get to it!  Pen up some smooth-hitting flows because that li'l freestyling pup from his 1997 debut has returned to the PS2!  Togged up in his claret beanie, some big ol' baggy pants, and a pair of funky red shoes, Parappa The Rappa must prevent his hometown from being dominated by the infamous Noodle Gang!  Suffusing burger joints with their noodles, the folks at Rappa's town fight back to regain their beloved, high-in-saturated-fat, heart-attack-causing cow patties.  Okay, so the third story in the series is not as charming as the first lovey-dovey one, but hey, the reasons why so many have hailed the first Parappa game as a brazen title is completely unbroken third time around (including Um Jammy Lammy).  Parappa The Rappa 2 simply rocks despite its lack of reconstruction or wave of advancement to its genre.The first one in the series was a landmark of beaming personality with its vivacious character designs and dainty backgrounds.  Its retrospective of colors and paper-thin models  were something to stare upon and talk about.  Parappa the Rappa 2 looks almost indistinguishably equal as the first but better.  Reintroducing all the attitude along with spiffier character visuals, the game runs smoother and juicier with a rich audio eminence.  Parappa's transposable charm is all rendered in the graphical ambiance as with the affluent scenarios found throughout.Although fairly undersized in length, with only eight levels, Parappa The Rappa 2 tenders what previous attempts have bided.  The saying, "if it ain't broken don't fix it," perfectly suits the nature of this game.  Basically, the player must tap in specific buttons in a rhythm in simon-says style.  Several buttons will appear on the screen and its up to the player to correctly hit the buttons displayed or commanded.  At the right bottom of the screen, the player's rating level determines how well the player is performing.  Obviously getting a good rating will advance players onto the proceeding stage.  The rating ranges from the lowest of "Awful"  to "Cool" as the best groove.  Should the player mess up on the button tapping, his rating will plunge from "Good" to "Bad" and finally "Awful."  Perfectly clocked in rhymes will have the player ascending on his rating.  If the player wishes to reach "Cool," then he must freestyle in between the commands given on screen by pushing any button as long as it goes with the flow and does not interfere with imperative commands.  Offering a two player battle mode and loads of button-smashing humor, Parappa The Rappa 2 doesn't shed anything quite new, but casts all the fun from as a splendid pastime.Of all the elements in Parappa The Rappa 2, the return of imaginative characters and their remarkable voice-overs is unsurpassed.  The music throughout the game drifts like a brilliant rap, presenting an appealing and positively inane (in a good way) tunes.In short, Parappa The Rappa 2's abrupt end left me ravenous for much more play.  Quite possible to be finished in one sitting, the game just begs for additional levels and challenge.  The overall quality in the game gleams, shimmers, shines, and what not, but the quantity of the game is the weakest constituent.  Even with its two player battle of the best freestyling spin-off, Parappa The Rappa 2's biggest quibble is the question of buying or renting it.  But don't let its shortage cloud your judgment because the game is just one of those games that'll you find yourself visiting over and over.  Though, next time around, Sony should flesh out a solid line-up of challenges and different play modes.  Boil it down and what you have is another fantastic party game.

OHH SHIP!! this is a good game.this game is has one of the best stor lines i've ever seen in a game.it has allthe aspects of a grate game, and losts of gore to go with it. this game dus not hold back when it comes to violenc. i meen this guy is smashing peopls heads ,cuting heads off,etc.. this is a grate game for the teen and older but not for the little kid. that is way it is rated &quot;M&quot;. one prblem i have is the targeting , you have to target some one if you want to hit him/her, rather then just attacking them. in some cases this is good but it gets old after a wile.I reomend renting it, But if you dont like renting game go bay this one.That all for me.

The is game is not perfect by a long shot but it is the best thing that I have seen in the fighting game. I played for about two hours and had to take a shower because my body was covered in sweat. I woke up and my entire upper body was sore, intensely sore.The last time my body was this sore was when I used the P90X workout plan. This game is awesome, in my opinion. I'm only three fights in but I plan on fighting all weekend. I get to workout and play the game at the same time. Win_Win..*****
The good:-Easy-to-learn gameplay-Everyone gets chopped up real good-Ain't it fun to kill...those cold-hearted Nazis?The bad:-Confusing gameplay at times-Graphics can be better(maybe not Rayne, however. . .)-. . .Rayne is too darn seductive to avoidThe strange:-Why can't those Nazis ever be greatful when you save their miserable lives?The awards for:Best cinema: The one involving that guy getting his ear chopped off.  Very Brutal!The overall:-This is one bloody mess, regardless of a couple of flaws.  If you like vampires, this girl is the perfect vampire it buy.

- Game comes with EyeToy.- Get a good aerobic workout rather than gain pounds sitting on your butt learning to kill people. Each level gets harder so your workout gets harder too.- Fast paced music and great artwork to motivate you.  30 minute workout seemed to last only 5 minutes!- Hoverboarding is a great gameplay concept and to-date this is the best camera-tracked game I've seen.- User interface is very well implemented and functions entirely with from the camera and a wave of your hand.- Built-in hands-on tutorial is excellent and gets you moving fast.- EyeToy camera warns you if there isn't enough light in the room by illuminating a little red light on the camera. But I've found that 2 60W bulbs did the trick at night.I teach video game programming at the University of Illinois at Chicago, so this is definitely one of the things I'm going to show my students.

This is an awesome game, and an even better workout!  I just got this game 3 days ago.  After playing for the first 40 minutes, my arms felt like jelly, I was sweating profusely, and breathing quite heavily.  The next day, I could barely move!  This game utilizes a crazy amount of muscles in the upper body.  Today(sunday), I've had to start punching over my head downwards to use a different muscle group, as I simply can't move my arms in an uppercut motion any more.This game will trick you into getting a hardcore workout, as you simply won't want to stop playing.  Eventually you'll get to the point where you physically can't extend your arms all the way, or fast enough amymore to play effectively, and you'll have to quit for the night.The tracking of your arms and fists is excellent, though I don't find the headtracking useful at all.  Once in a while my calibration will get screwed up, but 9/10 matches go without any problems.  It's easy enough to recalibrate if you need to mid-fight, though it will probably prevent you from having a perfect round if you're going for precision.  (UPDATE: you can put your hands back under your chin and hit the circle buttons to recalibrate on the fly, which doesn't generally ruin the flow of a fight at all).I would definitely recommend downloading the demo if you're on the fence.  You only get to punch a workout dummy, but it really gives a great idea of how accurate the tracking is, and it's really fun to punch the workout dummy.  It will definitely relieve some stress.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if you own 2 PS3 move wands and the camera.  I would even say its worth the investment to buy all the equipment if you don't have any PS3 move stuff yet.  That's why I bought it.UPDATE:After 12 days of playing (every day for 1.5 to 3 hours) I have lost an inch off my waist and gained a substantial amount of muscle in my upper body.  I would follow every other gaming session with 10 pushups and some crunches.  I feel and look so much better than when I started playing.The only real downfall of this game is the multiplayer.  The Host of an online match suffers a tremendous disadvantage, and the online matchmaking is rudementary at best.  I sent the developer an email asking them to at least fix the exploit with joining vs hosting a match (info@coldwood.com) and I would suggest everyone else who still plays this game does the same.I still maintain a 5 star rating, as the game mechanics and fitness aspect far outweigh the cons.  Once you get into the higher single player brackets, the fights get hard enough to keep you occupied trying to "Nail" every fight.  Keeping your health above 75% is actually quite difficult in the higher brackets.

PS Vita Travel PouchI bought the vita travel pouch right after I got my vita to help prevent scratches when I take my vita outside or on vacation. You open the pouch with a zipper revealing a piece of fabric in the middle. It divides the case into two sections. You put the vita in one side, I put the screen facing the fabric because it softer. On the other side are two mesh pockets for accessories. On the fabric that divides the case are four slots for vita game cards. The case also has a little hook which a strap can be attached too.The case is very durable and protects the vita perfectly.
I am the biggest hardcore player on SOCOM II. Online as of May 32st 2005, I have about 6100 Kills and 3500 Deaths. I am not just a hardcore fan, I am also pretty good. Now, there are many many things in this game to go over, and I couldn't possibly do it all. First off, do not bother getting this game to try the offline expierience.. it's well not worth it. With that out of the way, let me get down with the online play. Here are the POPULAR levels, my ratings, and how they stack up to me.( I most likely will not remember them all.. sorry. :( )OLD LEVELS:Frostfire: 10/10 : This level takes place on a very large ship, and it's at night time, but it is not that dark. The main thing I love about this map is how it is all flat, allowing for quick kills, and a lot of fun. A main feature about this level though is probably the tunnels, in where the Terrorists normally ' Camp ' from the SEALs with a shotgun and wait for them to come down. This level is different from the old version simply because the tunnels are connected. This is BYFAR my favorite map of SOCOM and SOCOM II. It is also one of the most popular SOCOM II maps. ( Most likely #3 ) Advantage: Most Likely TerroristsDESERT GLORY: 9/10: In this level, the SEALs must extract the hostages from their cells while the terrorists try and protect them. The title of the level is basically what the level is like. A very desolent level with a lot of sand and run down buildings. There are buildings to camp out in, stuff to hide behind, and it's just a great. This is also a very popular online map. ( Most likely #2 )Advantage: Probably TerroristsNIGHT STAKLER: 6/10: To many people, this reminds them of DESERT GLORY at night. But to me, I see it as a much different level. Though similar in design, this one is in mid-night ( so its not too dark ) and instead of extracting hostages, you have to plant a bomb. This level is similar to DESERT GLORY in some ways, but this level is bigger ( i think ) and not as fun. ( there are too many sniper positions.. it's almsost impossible to hide from them! ) This map, AS WELL is also a rather popular online map. ( Probably about #6 ) Advantage: Possibly the SEALsNEW LEVELS:CROSS ROADS: 8/10: This is the first level I played for SOCOM II online. This is litterally ALWAYS full of people in the public rooms, and is very, very popular. This level has the SEALs starting at one corner and the Terrorists starting at the other. You have to find the bomb and plant it at the opposing base. This level reminds me of a fancy middle-east market place for some reason. This level is pretty average to me, thogh. This one like i said is EXTREMELY popular. ( Definitely #1 ) Advantage: None, in ' Clan Wars ' this is normally the tie-breaker.There is many more maps, but those are just a few. I will now goto the guns ( I will try to list them all )SEALS:M4A1: 10/10: Great gun. Shoots fast, accurateM4A1SD: 10/10: Great gun. Shoots accurately, good for headshots, silencedRA-14: 9/10: Not bad of a gun. Accurate, takes off heavy damage.IW-80 A2: 10/10: Should be used by ' noobies ' very good accuracy, very good shooting, but considered a ' ***** gun 'AK-105: 8/10: Not too bad. Similar to the RA-14 but shoots slower.HK5: 6/10: Only good if you are good at getting headshots.HK5SD: 7/10: Only good for getting headshots, accurate.HK5K: 7/10: Horrible accuracy, but fast shooting, so almost a guarenteed kill.12 GAUGE PUMP: 4/10: Useless unless in tunnels on Frostfire!TERRORISTS:AK-47: 6/10: Not very good. Bad accuracy, not very good overall.AKS-74: 6/10: Similar to the AK-47.STG-77: 8/10: Similar to the SEALs HK5K , to me. Good for headshots.552: 6/10: Seems useless compared to SOCOM 1. Very weak.552SD: 6/10: More useless than 552; very weak, but silenced.9mm SUB: 7/10: Similar to the SEALs HK5K, good for headshots.TA 12 GAUGE: 6/10: Dont bother. Use the M3M3 12 GAUGE: 9/10: Automatic, Awesomely deadly, horrible on long range.NEUTRAL GUNS ( used on both sides )M16A2: 9/10: Only gun in the game that shoots on burst, similar to IW except harder to use, must tap trigger, deadly accurate.M14: 10/10: Unbelievebly powerful. Only 20 bullets. Accurate. Considered a ' noobie ' gun by some people.M60E3: 7/10: Considered a ' noobie cannon ', a lot of bullets, bad accuracy, good for killing someone during their reload time.M63A: 7/10: Considered a ' noobie cannon ', a lot of bullets, bad accuracy, good for killing someone durring their reload time.Now, this is how many bullets each gun has per clip.M4A1,M4A1SD,RA-14,IW-80 A2,AK-105, HK5, HK5K, HK5SD, AK-47, AKS-74, STG-77, 552, 552SD, M16A2: ALL HAVE 30 BULLETS9mm SUB: 60 BULLETSM14: 20 BULLETSM63A: 60 or 65 BULLETS ( sorry, i'm not sure )M60E3: 100 BULLETS12 GAUGE PUMP: 8 BULLETSM3 12 GAUGE: 12 BULLETS ( I think. )TA 12 GAUGE: 12 BULLETS ( I think. )Well, I did not include PISTOLS or SNIPERS in there, but i will now.For SEALs, use the MARK 23, MARK 23 SD, or SP-10 for a pistol, and a M87ELR for a sniper.For Terrorists, use the DE.50 or MAYBE the Model 18 ( the only automatic gun in the game ) for a pistol, and the M82A1A for a sniper.That is finally the END of my LOOOONG SOCOM2 review, and I hoped it helped you out.

The Uncharted Series has been a really good series and when Bend Studios announce Uncharted: Golden Abyss for the PS Vita I decided its a most buy. Putting the game into my PS Vita and starting the game noticing a big difference of graphics from a regular PSP game from a PS Vita game. Just Like most all Sony games they push the system and utilizes all its features. Uncharted Golden Abyss does that.Controls:Uncharted: Golden Abyss uses all the features that the PS Vita has to offer. From the two analog sticks to the touch pad in the back and touch screen in the front. UC:GA plays just like any other UC:GA games but with added features. I find this a big Plus since it made the game more fun and challenging. The controls are little awkward at first since the PS Vita is bigger than a normal PS3 controller. The touch screen is use when need to throw a grenade or to dust of artifacts for clues. Also when getting close quarter combat the player most swipe his finger on the direction the game tells the player to swipe. When climbing the player could also use the touch screen to guide Nathan to climb with a single touch. The Rear Pad is used to climb a robe or to rotate an artifacts. UC:GA also uses the PS Vita's Motion Sensing to take pictures and other stuff. After awhile the player will get use to the controllers.Graphics:Uncharted series is well know for its graphics. Just like any other uncharted games. Uncharted Golden Abyss have the best Graphics so far on the PS Vita. The beauty of the game makes this game so good for a handheld game. the PS Vita is the closes you will get to a PS3 game and Uncharted Golden Abyss is the one that shows it. With some minor Screen tearing Uncharted does everything good on the Graphics.Sound:Uncharted: Golden Abyss have some amazing music. The Sounds Effects of the guns and explosions are the same as the ps3. The voice acting is perfect. Dont have much to talk about graphics.Story:Nathan is on another mission to solve a 400 year old massacre of a spanish expedition. With his old friend Jason and Marisa. Jason back stabs and leaves Nathan and Marisa to find the true about what happen 400 years ago and to find out what happen to Marisa's Grandpa. As the story goes Nathan goes to the extreme and with cinematic driller cut scenes and situations will keep the player entertain.Overall:Overall Uncharted: Golden Abyss is just like the other Uncharted games but portable. The graphics and sounds are there and the gameplay is the same. the story will keep you want to play more. It takes a good amount of hours to past this game and for added challenges one could go back and find all the artifacts and pictures. I will recommend this game to everyone who has a PS Vita and who love the uncharted series. this game could be the reason you want to buy a PS Vita.
The pouch is made out of soft material but has very good interior padding to protect your Vita (front and back).Not sure if this is of importance to anyone but my previous HORI case had a horrible stench that has contaminated my Vita - the fabric on this one smells nice and will help preserve the original new manufactured plastic of your Vita.
Uncharted: Golden Abyss was made to show ps vita abilities, sony managed to serive that purpose. The game will take you through all functions of PS vita. It's recommended as a first game to get.However, coming to the negative part, the touch screen can get annoying sometime, especially in middle of fights where you have to shift between buttons and slide the screen in some direction to execute a move. Also, sometimes you are require to tilt or use the back touch pad of the ps vita in some level to blance Drake movement over bench or so, that gave me tough times. Otherwise, this is the uncharted we always knew, fun and enjoyable to play on portable device.
Although criticized by others, I absolutely love that Uncharted Golden Abyss scaled down on the scripted action scenes that were present in U2 and U3.  This game actually reminds me a lot more of Uncharted Drakes Fortune, my favorite in the series.  This time, Drake is a lot younger and it has a more explorer-y feel to the game.I think this is the definitive Vita game to get right now.  It is the best example of what the machine can do.  Highly recommended for anyone with a Vita or if you are a fan of the Uncharted series.
First of all I am sooo thankful that Telltale games and Playstation listened to the Vita owners and brought the Walking Dead to PS VITA!!!!!!!!!! Thank you so much !!!!!!!!!! I haven't played much Vita but this game is reason why I am playing the Vita non-stop.What can I say about the game, it is awesome, it is tense and exciting. I am a huge Walking Dead fan. I love this game. We need more like this for the Vita.
Golden Abyss combines the setting and feel of the first game, Drake's Fortune, then sprinkles in some polish seen in the second game, Among Thieves. Similar to Drake's Fortune, Golden Abyss is more scaled back when it comes to set piece level design and opts for something a little more restrained. However, do not take this as a fault, as Golden Abyss is quite frankly one of the most enjoyable Uncharted adventures to date.It's not developed by Naughty Dog, but it is developed by Sony Bend, who proved their game development mastery with games such as Resistance Retribution, Syphon Filter: Dark Mirror, Syphon Filter: Logan's Shadow, etc. Sony Bend is more than capable of delivering a full-on Uncharted experience in handheld form, and Golden Abyss is all the proof you need.This is a phenomenal Uncharted game brought to a handheld with wonderful graphics, witty and interesting storytelling, good characters, nice gameplay, etc. If you're an Uncharted fan and want to know the events before Drake's Fortune, buy Golden Abyss and I think you'll be very satisfied with what you're getting.
Its like walking through a story book and being a part of it.  It uses all of the PS Vita hardware very well

From what I'd heard, Buzz Quiz TV was a basic trivia game with a game show mentality. And that's pretty well spot on. You answer various questions as quickly as possible using the handy dandy buzzers that come with the game. (Batteries not included, so you'll need 8 AA batteries if you want to run all 4 buzzers.)  Oh, and the buzzers themselves, while a welcome addition, are pretty cheezy.  They're not the most sturdy of things and don't feel like they'll put up with much abuse.Now, it's been said, and it's worth saying again: it's really really hard to NOT compare Buzz to "You Don't Know Jack".  Your game show host "Buzz" is obviously a parody of game show hosts in general, but his smart-aleky smarm is very reminiscent of Jack. ...which makes me WISH this game WAS YDKJ... but it's not.  No totally bizarre quips, no outlandish put-downs, no inappropriate jokes at just the right moment.  *sigh*Anywho, the questions themselves are varied covering quite a wide range of knowledge.  And since this is an online enabled game, you can download even more questions for near infinite replayability.Buzz is a solid party game and with the 4 buzzers, it's easy to divide up into teams when you have more than 4 people who want to throw down their buckets of useless knowledge.  Solid game for more than 2 people... but if you're expecting Jack... go buy Jack.
Tired of "You Don't Know Jack"?Bored with "Who wants to be a Millionaire?"With Buzz! Quiz TV, you'll never need another trivia game for your Playstation 3.Inside the box is the game, four wireless controllers and a USB dongle. The dongle can connect up to 4 controllers, 2 dongles can be used to connect up to 8 players in one room. Two AA batteries are needed for each buzzer.The instructions for turning the buzzers on and off are included in the game manual. For the less tech-savvy, the Buzz! website has a 5-page PDF file which explains how the buzzers work.Buzz! can be played alone, with friends, or online.The following categories are selectable for Buzz! games:(1)  All types(2)  Movies & TV only(3)  Brainiac only(4)  Sports only(5)  Lifestyle only(6)  MyBuzz! questionsThere is the option to choose "Mature" MyBuzz quizzes (online only), view online leaderboards, or test the Buzz! buzzers.So what rounds are available?For the single player, there are 3 rounds of "Stop the Clock" - the faster the player answers a question, the more points are awarded.In multiplayer mode, a single game consists of 7 rounds:(1) Point Builder - Players answer questions with a time limit, each answer is worth 250 points.(2) Short Fuse - A random player gets a bomb and must answer a question correctly to pass it. The player holding the bomb when it goes off loses 300 points.(3) Fastest finger - The player who answers a question the fastest receives more points.(4) Pie Fight - Answering correctly grants control of the host to throw a pie at your opponents - if hit with 2 pies, a player is eliminated. Point bonuses are given for 1st, 2nd or 3rd place.(5) Point Stealer - The player buzzing in the quickest can steal points from another player.(6) High Stakes - Players are given a category description and bet from 100 to 500 pts - correct answers reward the bet value, incorrect answers detract the bet value.(7) Final Countdown - All accumulated points are converted to the player's platform height. Questions are asked while the platform descends and players that touch the floor are eliminated. The last player left wins the game.When playing online, another category is available:All That Apply - a VERY interesting category. A question is asked, with several possible answers. Players gain points for correct answers and lose points for incorrect ones. A popular tactic is to purposely choose incorrect answers, wait until online opponents copy them, and then change them before time runs out to lower the opponent's score.Here are just a few of the in-game question categories:People and eventsRecent musicGadgets & gizmosBlockbustersScience & technologyMind & bodyBuzz! Quiz TV is the FIRST online game to support the Playstation 3 trophy system - an achievement-based incentive for online players. The following trophies can be earned for bragging rights:Sofa Subjugator: Bronze / Silver / GoldThe Barnard Award: Bronze / Silver / GoldLonesome and Loving It: Bronze / Silver / GoldMyBuzz Enthusiast: Bronze / Silver / GoldSofa Surfer: Bronze / Silver / GoldSocialite: Bronze / Silver / GoldBuzz's New Best FriendThere are even hidden trophies to earn:He's on Fire!Channel HopperCasting AgentFlawless RoundAmateur QuizwriterLightning ReactionsAll in all, Buzz!

A "report content" button can flag inappropriate questions, and parental controls prevent free downloading by minors.Recent updates have allowed new character selections and costumes, new buzzer noises, and even support for thePlayStation Eye.I brought this game to a party as a field test, and everyone LOVED it.

As the 1-star reviewers warn, you need special hardware to make this game work -- the buzzers shown on the package. Only purchase the "software only" version if you have buzzers already, from another Buzz game (e.g., Hollywood).This is a fast paced quiz show, with adjustable question difficulty (easy, medium, hard) and a wide range of topics (similar to Trivial Pursuit). You customize "you" on the screen, and the prople to represent you are fun and varied. Winning or loosing, this is an enjoyable game for 2 to 4 players answering questions at the same time, or larger teams taking turns and discussing questions aloud. The same buzzers will work with other Buzz games.
Whenever I have friends over for  a party, invariably we end up playing some type of trivia game, usually while imbibing our drink of choice.  In fact, it's become a tradition at parties to break out a console and get our trivia game face on.  I love trivia questions, as do my friends.  Usually, we've gravitated to the Scene It? series on the Xbox 360, but that changed when I received Buzz! Quiz TV.On the surface, Quiz TV is basically your typical game show brought to virtual life.  There's nothing super exciting about it.  You just answer questions.  Sometimes questions are asked after looking at various pictures; sometimes it's a movie clip; sometimes it's an audio clip.  But it's always the same thing: a question is asked and you want to be the quickest to answer.  The categories are very wide-ranging, from the biggest blockbusters to different periods of music (90s, 80s, modern, oldies, etc.) to scientific questions to geographical questions...Buzz! Quiz TV has it all.  And with 5,000 questions out of the box and more available online, there's a ton of replayability inherent in the game.What makes Quiz TV unique and more entertaining than other similar games (Scene It? Lights, Camera, Action, I'm looking at you) is the wink and nudge, smarmy humor encapsulated in the host.  Buzz, the host, has that voice that can only be described as smarmy and says provocative things.  But it's all done with a wink and a laugh, a send up and parody of some of the really bad game shows hosts out there.  Additionally, while you can't create your own character, the selection of available avatars is terrific and, again, full of character.  Whether you're playing as a mime who strikes poses, the cheesy and egotistical super hero, or the 80s-style mall rocker, there's a lot of humor to be had.  Very expressive and, more interestingly, the host will respond based on the character you've selected.  So, playing as the super hero you will hear different remarks than if you were playing the has been 80s mall chick.Additional features add to the value.  For instance, if you have enough controllers, you can play with up to 8 people.  Or if you can't even find another person to play with, you can take the questions online.  Also, as seems to be the thing to do these days, there's a community section where you can craft your own trivia questions and spread them to the world or play other people's trivia questions.It would have been nice if you could play online and in the same room at the same time; that is, take your "team" of local players and compete against others online.  But, unfortunately, the online portion seems to be just one player.  This is a downside for me because games like these are more of a social activity and playing online, while still technically social, isn't as fun as having a group of people with you.Other small issues abound, though.  One thing to note is that the game doesn't come with batteries, so you'll need eight AA batteries to play it.  But the biggest problem for me is the lack of variety.  Sure there's variety in the groups of questions and the types of questions being asked, but the game types are set in stone.  For instance, you'll always begin a game with "the point builder" where you simply want to get an answer before the time runs out.  The second round will, again, always be the same and has you playing hot potato with a bomb where quick and correct guesses will get the bomb out of your hands.  The third round will always be the same, etc. all the way to the end.  It's not that the game types included aren't fun because they are (and have brought out tons of laughter amongst my gaming group), it's that there's not enough variety or randomness.One of the features I've enjoyed with Scene It? is that the game types are completely random and so it doesn't feel like you're playing the exact same game over and over.  I wish there were more game types and it was random, but I understand that the way it's created mimics typical game shows.Overall, though, Buzz! moves into the Playstation 3 world with a great solid entry.  I love the character of the game, whether it's the host or the individual contestants.  The questions verge on being a little too easy, but there's so many categories and fun questions that cover a wide section of our world that it's forgivable.  By far the best part is the post-release support.  Already there's at least one question pack, a Horror Movie Question Pack just in time for Halloween that included an additional 500 questions.  That kind of support will help give Buzz! Quiz TV longevity.  I just wish that there was more variety in the game types and rounds.
At first sight, you might think this game is a waste of money. What's the difference between this and Scene It?, you might say?Well, first of all, this game comes with four Buzzers... so it is very interactive. There are thousands of questions and 7 or so different categories. You can also choose to get questions from all the categories, which is the most fun.The questions are usually neither too easy nor too hard.Buzz, the long-mouthed host is very funny. His comments are intelligent; they go with what is going on. The artificial intelligence is very good. For example, if a person consistently gets questions wrong, but then all of a sudden gets one right, Buzz will make a comment on that.You can choose your own character, buzzer noise, clothes, and name. Some notable characters are a Mime (my personal favorite), a cheerleader, and a super hero. There are more characters to unlock too.Buzzer noises include a cow's moo, car horn, whistle, and more. These are updated once in a while with the game's update system.You can make your own quizzes or play, family against family (couch against couch, as the game calls it) with people around the world on the free PS Network.This is a great game for parties.Overall an excellent game; no issues whatsoever. I advise you to get it.
I had a lot of fun with this game, a lot more than I actually thought I would.  I had imagined this to be a lot like Jeopardy where you side back, choose a category, and answer questions.But there was much more.  You do choose categories (where, except the first round, the one with the lowest score chooses the category) but each round of question answering is different.  Like there is one where you get a bomb and you can pass it when you answer the question right.  When a random amount of time goes by the bomb explodes.  It is the variety of different ways to answer questions that make this really fun and it isn't difficult to figure out how to play it at all (we didn't read the directions and figured it out just fine on the fly).There are a ton of questions and after playing it several times we have yet to hear the same question twice.You also get to choose a character and that also made each of these fun as different characters each reacted to situations differently.  Some of the reactions were quite hysterical and more entertaining than the game itself.I only had one potential problem with this game, which is that you can't play this with just anybody.  Everybody gets the same questions so if I had younger children they wouldn't have a prayer of keeping up with Mom and Dad.  But my 12 year old was smart enough to get a lot of these questions right though some categories were plainly out of his league.  In other words, it isn't really "fun for the whole family", but it is great fun when you play with people who are roughly as smart as you.Other than the shortcoming of the previous paragraph, I thought this was a blast and would highly recommend it to people who like trivia games.
No need to dust off that Trivial Pursuit board anymore. If you're into board or trivia games, this game will make a great addition to any party. 4 buzzer controllers are included (2 AA batteries needed, not included) which allow each player to buzz in the answer like in a real game show. Coupling this with the greatly conceived gameplay make this title quite a bit of fun. Although the questions are a little too easy sometimes, the host and the animations from the characters are super funny, and the question categories are generally good throughout, ranging from Science and Tech, to 80's music trivia. Recommended title!
This game is cool beacuse u can go to a level that where your driving around on a 4 wheeler while the forest is burning and there some mud and alot of water. You can get cool 4 wheelers but the bad thing is that the best 4 wheeleru can buy is like alot lot like 755 thousand credits i tihnk i dunno but its alot and itll take me a while even tho i finshed alot of races and alot of freestyle levels im not even close to enough to buy the best 4 wheeler in the game. Overall its the best 4 wheeleing game ive ever played. There are plenty of levels in carrer mode. The races arent too hard. You have a large choice of mufflers, 4 wheelers, gloves, suites, gogles, tires, mini games and many more. In freeride there are cool levels theres ones where your at an army base theres another where your all around puddles and alot more amazing inviorments. Most of all THERE ARE PLENTY OF JUMPS. There are good songs. The only thing i didnt like was the graphics when your in the menu but the graphics when your racing and stuff are amazing. its not to hard to bust out tricks. I'd reccomend this game for a person into racing and exitment. Another thing is is that its not realy good for a person just buying a playstation 2 but overall one of the best games ive play on playstation 2.

Pros: Fun story mode and gameplay. Graphics are amazing, and you use all the buttons on the controller. It's the best next-gen game out there, and the most next-gen game out there.Cons: No MP so the replay value is gone if you platinum the gameI've played the first one and liked it, the second one to me was eh. So, I was indifferent to this game. I was pleasantly surprised, and this game was amazing! I love it.

I've been into videogames since Night Driver.  Grand Turismo 4 is the best racecar game in existence.  It is also the finest specimen of graphic achievement on the PlayStation 2.  The entire system works.  The game is meant for the most capable recent home video systems.  Put the game in, turn on the high def television, turn up the surround sound, and you'll be hooked from the moment you see the green light.The game has a complete sound system work-up, meaning Dolby Surround (II) audio.  The rear speakers activate when a car is behind you.  The ambient sound in the game is great.  You can completely control over four hours of music tracks.  You can also control the volume levels of the ambience, the engine noise, and the CD music.  The music has a complete variety including rock to rap, techno to classical.  You make the playlist.  You can make a seperate playlist for a photo show.The visuals are awesome.  The game runs in high def widescreen at  1080-interlaced, plain anamorphic widescreen, or the NTSC 4:3.  This is a beautiful game.  The in-game menu has picture adjustment controls to get the right look for each viewer's video rig including contrast, brightness, and more, and you can multiply that by two because there are two full sets of controls, one for while driving and another one for the replay.  The landscapes of the raceway circuits in this game will have you gaping in awe.  You get the sensation of speed by the high frame rate and the landscape model artwork.This is the best Grand Turismo ever.  This game puts the entire race spectrum, of all backgrounds, into the pot and layers music to it, and that's in the metaphoric sense of music.  You can prefer Formula, LeMans, Rally, Indy Cart, or NASCAR.  You can prefer trucks, SUVs, old V8s, stationwagons, 2-seater spyders, or cars less than 3400mm in length.  You can prefer superchargers, turbos, or naturally-aspirated vehicles.  You can prefer hardtops, softtops, no tops or moon roofs.  You can prefer 2-doors, 3-doors, 4-doors, or 5-doors.  You can prefer 4, 6, 8, or 12 cylinders.  You can prefer 3 speeds, 4 speeds, 5 speeds, 6 speeds, or 1-speeds.  You can prefer extra soft tires, extra hard tires, stock tires, sport tires, race tires, dirt tires, or snow tires.  You can prefer rear-engine, mid-engine, or front-engine.  You can prefer front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive, or all-wheel drive. You can prefer gasoline engines, diesel engines, electric engines, or engines by hand crank.  You can prefer a circuit that has 30-second laps or 10-minute laps.  You can prefer oval tracks, mountainous tracks, forest tracks, city tracks, or circuit tracks.  You can prefer tracks that really exist or tracks that do not exist, daytime or nighttime, and from a pace car or from a starting grid.  You can prefer tarmac tracks, stone tracks, dirt tracks, or snow tracks.  You can drive an autobahn in Germany, or let your team drive.  You can prefer stock cars, race cars, touring cars, rally cars, or street cars.  You can prefer American cars, British cars, German cars, Swedish cars, French cars, Italian cars, Australian cars, Belgian cars, or Japanese cars.This game truly has everything, and you get to manage a pit crew.GT4 is the best Turismo game because it perfects its gaming system and neglects any slight flaw of previous Turismos.  The ONLY part I missed was Turismo 3's masterful introduction video microscopically touring the inside of an engine to Lenny Kravitz rock music, because it amazes me every time, whereas GT4's intro vid rather promotes it's new photo gimmick: I like the gimmick, but the vid's not as artistic as GT3, even if the Van Halen song's nice.  I have only one recommendation: I like having lap records and track records that state the driver, the car, and the record time, which was best done in the first Turismo.One more thing, the graphics are done so well, I can tell that each vehicle has a different camera perspective in its distance from the ground.  For instance, when driving in an SUV, your seated position should be much higher than, let's say, a Formula 1 Ferarri; and in this game, each car's "ride height" is different.  I read a negative comment the person can't judge distance very well in this game.  (He owns an X-Box.)  I sympathize because I have the same trouble; BUT, from a real F1 Ferarri, the driver sits so close to the ground and drives so fast, it's impossible not to have to use landmarks!  NO ONE CAN SEE A TURN WHOSE EYE-LEVEL IS ABOUT 2 FEET OFF THE GROUND.  This is one of the smarter features GT4 provides.  GT4 has, to me, a very credible sense of speed!

You can prefer American cars, British cars, German cars, Swedish cars, French cars, Italian cars, Australian cars, Belgian cars, or Japanese cars.This game truly has everything, and you get to manage a pit crew.GT4 is the best Turismo game because it perfects its gaming system and neglects any slight flaw of previous Turismos.  The ONLY part I missed was Turismo 3's masterful introduction video microscopically touring the inside of an engine to Lenny Kravitz rock music, because it amazes me every time, whereas GT4's intro vid rather promotes it's new photo gimmick: I like the gimmick, but the vid's not as artistic as GT3, even if the Van Halen song's nice.  I have only one recommendation: I like having lap records and track records that state the driver, the car, and the record time, which was best done in the first Turismo.One more thing, the graphics are done so well, I can tell that each vehicle has a different camera perspective in its distance from the ground.  For instance, when driving in an SUV, your seated position should be much higher than, let's say, a Formula 1 Ferarri; and in this game, each car's "ride height" is different.  I read a negative comment the person can't judge distance very well in this game.  (He owns an X-Box.)  I sympathize because I have the same trouble; BUT, from a real F1 Ferarri, the driver sits so close to the ground and drives so fast, it's impossible not to have to use landmarks!  NO ONE CAN SEE A TURN WHOSE EYE-LEVEL IS ABOUT 2 FEET OFF THE GROUND.  This is one of the smarter features GT4 provides.  GT4 has, to me, a very credible sense of speed!
This game has truly photo-realistic graphics and additionally, the replays of the areas are incredible.  The game even permits one to save replays.  The cars in this game are absolutely incredible, and unlike other games, you are not limited to some specific models with similar designs.  Additionally, the selection of cars is absolutely phenomenol.  My best cars for this game are the Jaguar XJ220, the GT-ONE Road Car, the infamous rally car Suzuki Escudo Pikes Peak Version and the Corvette C-5R.  My favorite car, however, has to be the 2000 Beetle Cup, but the handling is clumsy and sometimes forced, like a Beetle.  The scenery is incredible!  I absolutely love the Tokyo tracks and the Rome track for the views of the city.  I additionally love the rally tracks around Tahiti and the wet tracks of Tokyo.  The last note for this game is the game becomes very difficult on the Professional Level.  For example, on the Red Emblem level, you are forced to drive a ROAD car, and you are forced to compete against six other RACE cars (in other words, much better and faster cars than yours). One of the major disappointments for this game is that there is no crash damage, like NASCAR Thunder, Sprint Cars: World of Outlaws or the incoming Pro Race Driver.  The second and last disappointment is that in mutiplayer, especially two-player, one doesn't face computer cars as well, as in NASCAR Thunder.  However, Codemasters' Pro Race Driver may resolve that issue.  Other than that, buy this game if you are a racing freak or just a freak!

Stellar gameplay is what catapulted this series to prominence, and GT3 harnesses the PS2's additional horsepower to deliver thrilling, challenging races. The realism and depth of even the Arcade races mean GT3 is definitely suited for serious drivers only. GT2's lineup of street and off-road courses is joined by two new tracks: a cool downtown Tokyo circuit and the renowned Grand Prix course at Monte Carlo. While the car lineup is smaller than GT2's, it's still vast, offering everything from Dodge Vipers to Cooper Minis. It's a shame that more European exotic cars like Ferraris didn't make the lineup, though. However, GT3's much-vaunted A.I. isn't quite the revolution it was touted to be. Sure, the cars no longer robotically follow the same racing line and they'll occasionally sideswipe you, which are great improvements. But the changes amount to nice tuning, rather than the promised new experience. The off-road rally racing has been greatly improved, though, offering a much more playable, enjoyable ride. It's a lot like playing Colin McRae Rally 2.0-the action is that sweet. But GT3 isn't perfect. The races could really use more cars on the track; depending on the circuit, you'll face between one and five opponents. More importantly, the total absence of wrecks and damage to the cars makes such a highly realistic experience ring false at times. These nagging flaws have persisted since the first GT, so rather than being surprising, it's more of a shame that they weren't addressed. The GT series has a huge worldwide fan base, and GT3 measures up to those high expectations with style and depth. If you're into racing at all, this instant classic is simply a must-own game.

The Gran Turismo franchise was my first venture into simulation console racing and from the onset I was fascinated with its depth and challenge.  By the time 4 came out, I was desperate to acquire it, so when I received it as a Christmas gift I was elated.The first thing I did upon opening this game and popping it into the drive was to scroll through the car dealerships and ogle all the vehicles that had been added since the iconic GT3.  "Karmann Ghia, say WHAT?"..."Jay Leno Tank Car...uh...cool?"  But seriously, there are some amazing rides in here (and I really do like the Ghia, AKA VW Typ 14).  Amazingly awesome vehicles include, for a very short list, the road-going BMW M3 GTR, Mercedes CLK-GTR race car, and the Lancia Delta S4 rally car, which, when modified, has the most explosive acceleration you will ever see.Then...gameplay.  The license test thing has always been a love/hate situation.  On the one hand, it presents a linear challenge that familiarizes you with segments of tracks (and whole tracks, for the good ol' S license) and various cars.  Unfortunately, some of the "sage racing advice" given is simply rubbish if applied in real life, and having a game judge whether you are qualified to play it seems a bit ridiculous.  Regardless, I pushed through the license tests and felt increasingly successful each time I achieved a gold medal, then moved on to the racing.Ah, the racing.  Some of the races are simply atrocious.  Let's take an inside peek, for example, at the "24 Hours of Nurburgring."  Oh, Friday night!  What to do, what to do...I know!  I'll sit on my duff and drive a single simulated car on a single simulated track for literally 24 hours straight!  Sounds like a blast!  Things like carpal tunnel, sleep deprivation, starvation, and console overheating will surely NOT be a problem!  Let's get to it!  Oh yeah, and the track is the most challenging not only in the game, but in the whole real world.  And if you don't place first on your first try, enjoy repeating it until you do.  Oh, and take a hint, Polyphony Digital.  In real life, 24 hour races are generally not completed by a single person.Fortunately, the folks at Polyphony Digital who received the game after the folks who decided putting in 24 hour races (yes, plural...more than one) would be bomb, forsaw the above mentioned problems (except console overheating...good thing the GT franchise has never been for XBox 360) and included a B-spec mode!  So.....ok so the term "B-Spec" means absolutely nothing to you?  Fair.  Basically, the affectionately named "B-Spec Bob" is a race slave...ha, ahem, I mean, driver, who really enjoys driving for you and would never ask for any money, who will dutifully complete races lasting 24 hours, and will EVEN let you speed things up by 3x so that the race only takes 8 hours!  Of course, B-Spec Bob is not you.  He will not use opponents as devices to aid in cornering.  He will not cut across the grass because it is clearly faster.  He will not pit if you told him to go fast, even if his tires have completely melted away and he is driving on bare, sparking rims with only fumes rising from the petrol tank.  But he will do races for you for free, and for that we must all thank B-Spec Bob.GT4 did not attempt to venture into any new territory as far as racing goes.  Yes, superbly realistic physics are still here (and who would want them removed?  It's a SIMULATOR).  We still have a variety of real and fake tracks, including all the "GT Classics" and several super slick new layouts such as the stunning Amalfi Coast, which you will want to drive around at 5 MPH to enjoy the scenery.  There are still rally stages, albeit with a SUPER ANNOYING "5 second penalty" of computer-controlled throttle cut if you biff a wall or opponent (OR if an opponent hits you like a complete jerk...there is no justice in this game).  You can even race along the Grand Canyon now.  Oh yes, and the clincher.  You can STILL plow violently into six opponent cars, a tunnel wall, a cliff, three barricades, and a flimsy orange nylon fence which behaves like a stone wall to protect the jeering fans behind it, all at 200 miles per hour in a single radical collision, and never lose a chip of paint or risk rollover.  It will slow you down a bit though, so try to avoid it.  However, your car can get dirty over time (although you'll never be able to see that), and washing it for a few quid can improve your lap times!  Okay, GT4, thanks for that.  AT least the new GT5 is reported to include damage, so we can all stop whining.There are some cool new additions, though.  New cars and tracks, nitrous oxide, a drag strip, a really slick photo mode (both in and out of races), and a clean, white background layout make this a great refresh on the successful old formula.Here are the cons of the game; the pros are that it is a super realistic racing simulator with tons of cars and neat extra features.-No damage (GT trademark, until the new one)-Irritating penalties for rally contact (even when it's not your fault)-Audaciously long races-Slightly obtuse B-Spec Bob is free to use, but what's the fun in that?-No Ferraris, Porsches, Maseratis, or Lamborghinis (EA had the license, or something like that)-Considerable amounts of trippy music not available elsewhere (but you can turn it off)-Upgrade system could be improved (who really wants to pay 50 grand for "frame straightening" when there IS NO DAMAGE?)All in all, although I'm now a Forza fan, I still hail GT4 as a wonderful and immersive game that certainly occupied hours of my time (including 8 hours directing B-Spec Bob around the "Green Hell" AKA Nurburgring Nordschliefe).[Oh. P.S.  We get it, Polyphony Digital.  You guys love Nissan cars.  They are pretty sporty, yes.  But including 100 of them in your game was not exactly necessary.  Seriously, you must have had like 92 and then came up with 8 new Skylines to round up to that nice even 100.]

This is it, race fans - the finest racing game yet available.  Nearly photorealistic visuals, stunning attention to real-world physics, and the feel of good old knock-down, drag-out racing.  You can't get any better than this.Single players can play arcade style races or enter simulation mode to compete on multiple-race circuits; there are different car classes, unlimited qualifying, and money to buy cars, parts, and other trinkets.  Learning the tracks and your car is essential to successful driving; the manual comes with a few pages from the Skip Barber manual that will give you the basics.You'll grit your teeth in frustration trying to beat a souped-up Daihatsu wagon in your stock Miata at the lower-echelon levels; and your brain will explode trying to pilot a Dodge Viper-based racecar around a track at speeds exceeding 150 miles per hour.  Every aspect of the experience is realistic and adjustable, from tire camber to gear ratios; sound is awesome; and there are hundreds of cars to choose from.  Music selection is a little sparse.Multiple players can compete on 1 screen, or the iLink cables and hub can be used to link up to 4 racers (requiring a PS2 and a TV for each of them.)I've never played a driving game this good - and i've played 'em all, starting with Turbo in the local pizza parlor at age 11 (did I just date myself?), to Pole Position, Hard Drivin', Cruisin', Vette, Crazy Taxi, Midnight Club Street Racing, the list goes on.  If your passion has anything to do with cars, video games, or racing, you'll love this game!

Out of all the Twisted Metal games that has ever come out, Twisted Metal: Small Brawl is the one you'll hear the least about. Yet, in my opinion, is about one of the most fun of them all to play. It came out after Twisted Metal Black. It's easy to see that this game is pointed more toward the younger crowd but, being a Twisted Metal fan, I loved it just the same.  In this game, Calypso is a schoolyard bully who harasses the characters into joining in an RC car version of the Twisted Metal contest. All of the game's drivers  are all children who attend the same grade school as him.  They all command miniature versions of the cars they drive when they get older. Eleven characters are available from the get go with 5 more to unlock, having mostly every one of your favorites in the roster. There's 8 levels to battle in..Playground Peril, Carn-o-maul, Easy Death Oven, Minigolf Mayhem, Meat your Maker, Gridiron Gore, Treetop Rumble and Now Slaying!. It's a younger, more lighthearted approach to the Twisted Metal formula but fun. I love it.

...  This game is a prime example of what can be done if a company decides to put maximum effort into there product.  This game is such a beutiful reminder of why we love the Twisted Metal series so much.  This easliy destorys the competion Carmawhat, Rouge who, Vigilante what #?The theme to this is Rolling Stones song Black, and it fits the idea for the game masterfully.  The contest now has some really freaky cahracters, doesn't matter if it's BRimstone the possessed priest, or Spectre the insane bride, you have some really sick characters.  Unlike the past two where we had Grannies and Hippies for contestants.There is so much destruction in this game that it is insane, and fun.  Virtually every thing can be destroyed.Overall this is well worth owning, no matter who you are (Unless your a tree hugging hippie who objects violence).

They're bacccccccccck, and badder than ever!Twisted Metal Black is without a doubt the most disturbing game in the popular series.  Each character has a dark story, and is looking for an answer, but they need to win the tournament called Twisted Metal to receive thier wishes.  Characters from previous games in in here: Sweet Tooth, Mr. Grimm, Axel, Warthog, Minion, Road Kill and a batch of new characters.  I personally like the opening to Sweet Tooth.

Well here's the lowdown, the twisted fighting, plot, and cars are back in this hit sequel to the best selling series Twisted Metal. TM2 brings you back into the Twisted Metal Competition. But this time, it's a one way trip 'round the world. Battle in L.A. to Hong Kong and leave a trail of destruction behind you. TM2 introduces a few new characters into the fray: Twister, Grasshopper, Shadow, Axel, and Mr. Slam. Duke it out with a wide variety of old favorited weapons to new and improved weapons like the napalm, remote detonator, and the ricochet bomb. Beat all your opponents and you might get a chance to have an audience with Calypso, the twisted creator of the Twisted Metal Competition, and have your wishes fullfilled.Bottom Line: An awesome sequel to an already awesome game
With Twisted Metal on the horizon for the PS3, I thought I'd revisit Twisted Metal: Black for the PS2 and give my honest opinion on it. As most of you know(who've read my reviews, anyways); I've been a Twisted Metal fan since the early days of the PSone. I've owned, practically, every game at some point and have loved every single one.Given that Twisted Metal 3&4(developed by 989 Studios)tarnished the Twisted Metal name somewhat, Incognito Entertainment(now called Eat, Sleep, Play) decided to bring Twisted Metal back in style for the PS2. Thing is, Twisted Metal: Black bears no resemblance to the games that have come before it. Except for the core gameplay and the characters returning, Twisted Metal:Black is a darker, more violent beast. I have to say, this new beast intrigues me. However, if you're coming into Black expecting it to be a walk in the park, well-my friend, you're going to be unpleasantly surprised. Things have changed drastically in the TM universe. The levels you battle in are massive, The game is faster and more responsive. Yet, the game is hard as nails, at times.Overall, Twisted Metal:Black delivers everything you'd expect and then some.

I've been playing iD games since the original Wolfenstein. I can't begin to total the hours spent playing Doom/Doom2/Final Doom and all the WADs people made at home that got swapped around on message boards and the old AOL, Hexen....ehhh not so much, it was fun but then came Quake and holy crap was quake good. Quake was to Doom what Doom was to Wolfenstein. Enter Quake 2. I had this when it first came out on the PS1 and I played it till my fingers bled and my eyes dried up. Very Doom-ish level design and the ever present double barrel shotgun was a must. This time there is the machine gun that was my favorite. While it might be hard to get used to the pre-analog controls [move with the d-pad and look up and down with the shoulder buttons] after playing dual stick FPS's for almsot a decade, it still has the flavor that makes you want to pick it back up. I am happy to have this in my collection again.

Gee, this game could use a decent review, I guess.I never could finish the first Dark Cloud. It just sort of dragged, with dungeons always feeling the same, lack of any real semblance of a story line, too much useless character switching... The flaws are too numerous to name. Yet there was something about it, wasn't there? The way it stitched different genres together into a fairly cohesive package, the way it gripped you and made you keep going... It was with a somewhat heavy heart that I set it aside.I'm very pleased to report that its sequel removes much that hindered the first game and adds in enough fresh, thoughtful and fun material to make it one of the ten best games on PS2. The graphics are outstanding, the storyline fairly fun and enjoyable, the combat heavily improved, the gameplay systems streamlined yet complex. Even the music is very good, something I can't remember from the first game.There are so many things to do, you'll always be busy, and nothing goes without a reward. All the mechanics are introduced slowly, which I think is nice. You'll never feel overwhelmed. There is on-line help and visual tutorials up the yin-yang (which you can access anytime but never HAVE to view), and there are also handy in-game checklists that automatically keep track of everything you're doing, from building up towns to taking pictures (for the purposes of inventions and also "scoops") to developing your weapons, recruiting characters, fishing, golfing (??), and of course dungeon frollicking. And the story moves along at a pretty good clip with dialogue and events interspersed between dungeons.If there is a fundamental flaw in the game, and I think maybe there is, it's that, despite all the variety and fun, it gets a little repetitive.  All games are, by nature, a bit repetetive, but it seems more transparent here.  I can't help but ponder the fact that I'm going through floor after floor of random dungeons, the only goal being to find geostones, plant little houses, and advance the story (which isn't exactly Great Works material anyway).  It bothered me in the first game, and it still bothers me here, although to a lesser extent.  It's for this reason that I prefer Xenosaga, and even .hack, which seemed to satisfy me a little more.  Oh, and sphere golf is HORRIBLE (great idea, awful execution--why can't I move the camera to see where I'm shooting?).Overall, one of the best PS2 games to come out this year (so far), and certainly a stand-out, even in the RPG-heavy month of February (four good RPGs were released--.hack, Breath of Fire V, Dark Cloud 2, and Xenosaga: Der Wille zur Macht). I recommend this one with slight reservation.  It's definitely not PS2's Zelda, as some have said.  Not that it even SHOULD be; it is what it is.A bonus paragraph: it's not as if the localization is really bad... it's just not really good. As someone learning the Japanese language, I would give about anything to have a Japanese vocal track on this game (like .hack, which gives one the option of choosing English or Japanese vocalization). I can't help but feel that its transition to English is something of a bastardization, as names have changed, liberties have been taken... which is probably what most Americans wanted anyway, but for someone who enjoys Japanese flavor in a game created by Japanese, I can't help feeling a little sad at how Americanized it ended up. The voice-acting is not bad, but neither is it good, and I didn't care for the vocal song accompanying the transition from prelude to the main story. With all the gigabytes available on a DVD (and the option for dual-layered, double-sided, etc), would it have been so difficult to include the original Japanese dialog to be heard while viewing the English subtitles? All games should do this. It wouldn't be expensive at all, and it would really please hardcore Japanophiles like me.

Play this game and beat it, you wont be dissappointed. At the time this cart came out, not many games were into plots or design or music, but this game excels in all of those. Yes it is a bit easy to defeat, but it is worth playing. The main characters have awesome voice overs and dialogue. The female protagonist is played by no other than Heidi Hudson Leick who played Callisto in Xena! If you enjoy Ghosthunter, you will enjoy this one.

That's all I can pretty much say. This game is so realistic, I can't belive my eyes. The graphics are great, the fighting's terrific, and the cops are powerful. Yes, this game's a little, ok a lot, bloody. But this game's not for Christians or protective mothers. This game has some great voice acting. There's some charecters from Sopranos, Twin Peaks, and Time Bandits in this. The radios kick ... also. My favorite is Chatterbox. This game has it all. Amazing.

The console works. Not DOA. This is the main reason i am writing it.Thanks amazon for selling this game to me when i lost hope on 22nd OCT.I flipped this young Sony gangsta for $700. The lord is good. I was scared that the buyer would tell me &#34;DOA&#34; after reading many of the reviews but he called thanking me on the product. He said he put a smile on his kids. Well he also put one on me. The best of it is that i snatched a new console from Gamestop tonight by 8 pm. Man i am balling out. Thanks sony. Hope those who got DOA consoles have a quick resolution. Well i am scared to test the one i have now from gamestop. Maybe i should hold it till Xmas and sell it to another rich father.Good luck mates. I hope to play with u all soon if i don't flip this new one.
I WAS REALLY  BLOWN AWAY BY THE GREAT FIGHTING IN THIS GAME . AS WELL AS THE COOL FORMS JEN TAKES..BUT THE ONLY THING THAT MADE THE GAME A BIT BORING AT TIMES,WERE ALL THE ENDLESS PUZZLES YOU HAD TO DO THRU THE GAME.IT WAS FUN PLAYING AS SCREE , AND SOMETIMES  DOING A BIT OF FIGHTING .. BUT HE SHOULD'VE HAD A BIGGER ENERGY BAR , OR MAYBE EVEN A SECOND ONE .THAT WAY IF YOU EVER NEEDED TO GET SOME OF HIS ENERGY AFTER A BIG FIGHT, YOU WOULDN'T COMPLETELY TAP HIM DRY.. JUST IN CASE YOU NEEDED SOME MORE ENERGY AFTER RUNNING INTO MORE DEMONS TO KILL !! PLUS A LOT OF THE TIME YOU STILL GOT LOST , USING THE MAP- OR YOU COULD NOT USE IT IN CERTAIN AREAS..BUT IT WAS ALSO NICE TO KICK DEMON ASS AS A DIFFERENT DEMON , RATHER THAN THE ONE YOU WERE FIGHTING . FERAI , AND DJINN ARE THE BEST FIGHTERS ..BUT DJINN HAVE SWORDS AND FERAI ONLY CLAWS.. THE WRAITH ARE COOL TOO WITH THEIR WHIPS..BUT ALL IN ALL IT WAS A COOL GAME AND GAVE ME LOTS OF FUN PLAYING IT..

PLAY,CREATE,SHARELittleBig Planet solo para el Playstation 3, en un juego muy divertido, parece simple pero tambien es muy desafiante, del estilo de Super Mario, LittleBigPlanet nos invita a sumergirnos en un mundo de fantasia donde la creatividad es la orden del dia. Aunque sus graficos parezcan pocos sofisticado, la belleza de los mismos se apreciaen en HD (720p) texturas, efectos, disenos, mundos, y lo mejor de todo la personalizacion del personaje principal Sackboy/sackgirl que hace que cada uno sea distinto y unico.Perfecto para toda la familia, los pequenos de la casa se divertiran y los mas grandes tambien, no solo con los niveles disponibles en en el discom sino la gran cantidad de DLC que constantemente se lanza atraves de la PlayStation Network tanto de niveles, trajes y demas que se puedan imaginar.Multiplayer: FANTASTICO, es que este juego se disfruta mas en compania (sea local o online)El Online: IMPRESIONANTE. no solo te permite jugar en linea con hasta 4 participantes mas, sino que al poder los usuarios crear "mundos" y subirlos, encontraras niveles nuevos todos los dias, de todas las tematicas, solo la imaginacion es tu limite y como dice el comercial "you never finish LittleBigPlanet", y es cierto, siempre hay retos y aventuras nuecas esperando a un click de distancia y todo de manera sencialla de obtener.LittleBigPlanet, un videojuego que no puede faltar en ninguna coleccion de Playstation 3 que se precie, no importa si eres hard core gamer u casual camer, no importa si te gustan los shooters o las plataformas, el arcade o la simulacion, es un MUST HAVE.A que esperas para tenerlo?
Un juego para toda la familia, entretenido y ademas promueve la creatividad enormemente.Quizas todo su potencial estan mas alla de las capacidades de un ni&ntilde;o de 8 o menos, sin embargo la diversion que brinda es suficiente para recomendarlo a ni&ntilde;os de esa edad.Un buena introduccion a comunidades virtuales para los menores donde no solo expresan su personalidad con atuendos y demas, sino que desarrollan la imaginacion creando mundos propios que por mas simple que sean los reconfortan al saber que pueden compartirlos.Definitivamente recomendable si se tienen ni&ntilde;os, para adultos creo que la mayor diversion se obtiene compartiendo con ellos en este Pegue&ntilde;o Gran Mundo que es LBP.
Terriffic Game!En este review no puedo decir algo nuevo de lo que ya se ha comentado sobre este juego. Historia Tremenda! (Como es costumbre en la serie) Graficos Increibles y accion frenetica desde el inicio del juego (comienza justo donde finalizo GOW II), Jefes Imponentes y con efectos sumamente logrados, de lo mejor en graficos que existe para el PS3, y la jugabilidad simple y adictiva que ha hecho de la serie GOW todo un exito en todas sus versiones. Dicho esto solo puedo recomendar el Juego, no puede faltar en cualquier coleccion que se precie de PS3.PROS:-Excelente historia (unida a la 2 entregas anteriores), forma un cierre epico de la saga.-Excelente Gameplay.-Excelentes Graficos (los efectos de luz, de lo mejor que hay en PS3).-Mucha diversion.CONS:Duracion (que no es lo mismo que durabilidad) el modo historia se puede culminar entre 9 y 12 horas, muy poco.. pero en su favor tienes que esas 12 horas seran de pura adrenalina, diversion, jefes epicos, historia trepidante..PD:Si deseas disfrutar de este juego mas aun te recomiendo que compres primeroGod of War: Collection, de verdad que no te arrepentiras, y junto con este, hacen un JUEGO EPICO!
un demo jugable lo hace uno pensar que no necesita el juego pues te puedes pasar horas y horas divirtiendote con elpero una vez sumido en el juego siempre llega la cosquilla de otros mundos, otras variaciones, etc.ya compre el juego a un excelente precio y ahora la cosquilla me da por los adds-on disponiblesmi unica queja es que uno acostumbrado a jugar "Capturando la Bandera" en el demo, como que decepciona que la mayoria de las partidas creadas por los usuarios sean de Death Match individual
Escencialmente es un juego para todos aquellos que les gusten los juegos de acci&oacute;n, o sean fans o no tengan PS3. Es uan excelene colecci&oacute;n. Y son 2 juegazaasos. Graficamente no compite con los juegos nativos de ps3, pero aun as&iacute; es mucho mejor en muchos mas aspectos. Y sabiendo que son juegos de psp, es claro que las graficas son grandiosas y que los desarrolladores son magos.Recomendadisimo!
Creo que definitivamente es un producto de un alto valor, pero creo que vale lo que uno paga por el, mis hijos la pasan de lo mejor jugando, yo tambi&eacute;n y adem&aacute;s podemos ver peliculas en familia y tener acceso a todos los portales que necesito en internet con la pantalla de mi TV como monitor! Si creo que los juegos deberian de valer menos.
para jugar este juego!! tienes que tener internet!! sin internet no se puede jugar!! eso es la unika queja!! jajaja pero el juego es increible!! nunk se aburriran de el!! cada partido es diferente! unos ladilla pero otros son increibles!! es muy bueno!! y esta version es mejor por que no consume memoria en el play trae el headset para comunicarse con la gente!! es muy bueno!
este juego es simplemente lo mejor!! esta muy bien hecho y la trama es muy buena!! viene en casi todos los idiomas!! lo recomiendo!!! no es el que tenga las mejores graficas pero es lo mejor!!!see ya!
ES UNO DE LOS MEJORES PRODUCTO QUE HA SACADO LA SONY TIENE UNA COMPATIBILIDAD AL 100 % CON LAS CONSOLAS PS3 Y SPS VITA ES IDEAL PARA PEQUE&Ntilde;OS Y MODERNOS AMBIENTES , ESTILO ERGON&Oacute;MICO SE&Ntilde;AL &Uacute;NICA DETECTA AUTOM&Aacute;TICAMENTE DE TIPO DE FORMATO ES (POSTERIOR A LA CONFIGURAR EN TU PSP.100 % RECOMENDADO
Compr&eacute; este juego para mi hija de 11 a&ntilde;os. Ella y su hermana lo adoran. Yo prefiero otros juegos pero estando con ellas veo que tiene una gran historia, como le&iacute; en previos reviews. Es una buena compra para ni&ntilde;os adolescentes.

Back in 1997, almost all gamers were talking about the debut of Squaresoft's Final Fantasy VII for the PSX. I, never having played an RPG before that point, played a demo of the FFVII at my cousins house (that was packaged with Square's Tobal No.1 - little known fighting game). That christmas I asked Santa for a Playstation and a copy of FFVII. Sanata delievered and I enjoyed and occupied myself for many hours that christmas...But this review is about Wild Arms. After I had completed FFVII after the holidays, my classmate lent me his copy of Wild Arms. While Wild ARMS didn't contain all the hype and flash that FFVII had going for it (far from it in some aspects), I felt the game overall was a real winner.Even five years after it's release I still can't praise this game enough. Graphically the game is very out-of-date by today's standards, but one must realize the game's graphics were out-of-date the minute FFVII flexed it's polygonal mucsles only a few months later. If your rating how good an RPG is by it's graphics, then you are not a true RPG fan in any way, shape, or form.Graphics was never the series' strong point, even though the graphics for Wild ARMS 2 were very well done (outside of the battle system mind you!), and Wild ARMS 3 cell-shading was nice (but kinda dull overall).What really made Wild ARMS such a strong game is the excellent character development that easily rivals ANY square-enix title (I'm not afraid to make such a bold statement!). When you really start to feel for the game's characters, espeically when tradegy strikes them, you know you have a winner. Even the game's villians are very well developed and very, very memorable (I still refer to them in gaming conversations after all this time). Some may say the story is your typical save-the-world fare, but I still think it beats the heck out of some of the plotlines in games today (where original ideas seem to be lacking overall).Wild ARMS, simply put, is a classic. Personally, I would put this above FFVII in terms of my overall favorites, even though I played FFVII first (FFVII still being another one of my top favorites). Even if your a new to Wild ARMS, or a fan, this is one RPG not to overlook.Hmmm... I wonder what the PSX2 remake, Wild ARMS: Alter Code F is going to be like?

it's a ok game, but get Battle Tanx or Battle Tanx:Global Assault instead.  They have a better plot and were kinda the preddessors to this game(which the batlle tanx series is also made by 3DO).

There is a sad truth in the RPG world.  That truth is that unless the title bears the name Final Fantasy the only way it will sell is through word of mouth.  This is one of those games that could easily be overlooked.  A shame because in it's own right it's a classic.The story revolves around you, you wake up to find out that your village, among others have been destroyed by a creature known as the Dark Genie.  the fairy king gives you the task of rebuilding the world, and stopping the Dark Genie.  You are given a magical stone and are sent on your way.This is an action RPG so there are no random encounters, instead the creatures are already there.  There are two thingd to take caution in:1) the weapons HP, if that drains the weapon vanishes, so you must be careful with battles.2) You hydraton level.  Or how thirsty you are.  If tht drains then your HP will drain, similar to poison.Overall this is worth checking into for the sole reason that it is fun and worth a look.  It may be surprising how much fun this can be.  Not all great RPG's bear the name Final Fantasy you know (even if they are a lot of fun).

I have been playing RPG's on computers since I was able to first buy a computer. From the very first days of the text adventures like Zork from Infocom, back in the late 70's, until now, I have enjoyed RPG's on computer and console.I'm no authority on RPG's by any means but for a console game, Legend of Dragoon is off the hook. It's a fabulous game with many of the RPG elements I appreciate: leveling, spells, magic items, lots of monsters, good storyline, etc.Like Zelda on NES and Shining Force II on Game Gear, Legend of Dragoon has given me newfound respect for console RPG's. I have not played Final Fantasy so if that is the measure of a console RPG game, then perhaps I haven't truly experienced what a console RPG can really be like.But, suffice to say that Legend of Dragoon has me wanting for more. If you're thinking about getting this dated game, even now, do it. It's well worth the money.

First and foremost,if you are one of those die-hard,extremely serious,Final Fantasy obsessed,couldn't laugh even if my life depended on it RPG players,then don't play this game as it will confuse and destroy your narrow,closed-mind.But if you like to have fun when you play video games,appreciate something original and like to laugh;then check this one out!Okage:Shadow King is truely a unique RPG set in a "Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas" type enviroment.From the very start, the nature of this game is light-hearted and extremely humorous.This RPG is the story of a young,insecure boy named Ari that no one seems to notice(downright ignore in certain parts!)Regardless of what you say or how you feel,people will pretty much just tell you what to do and how to be,all the while ignoring your responses(does any of this sound familiar to you in your life??)All of this changes for the quiet boy the day his zealous,nutty-professor type father shows him his cursed lamp that holds the "Evil King Stan"!Stan is a shadow monster who can only exist in the outside world by posessing a person's shadow.However,the shadow must be from a person who could "easily get lost in someone else's shadow"!Naturally Ari is the perfect canidate as he is never noticed and has next to no self-confidence.Stan however is hardly a "monster",in fact everyone he tries to scare just finds him "cool",or even "cute" by the girls.Stan being the self-proclaimed terror that he is,won't rest until he and Ari(his "slave" as he calls you)find the cause for his loss of horrific,dark power.The storyline for this game is just great,and I could really feel for Ari being so overshadowed.However this is all done in a humorous manner,and everyone,even the "villains" deliver some lines that are really funny(my personal favorite is from Ari's younger sister:"Mom gave me a book she reads to help me out with my first date tonight.What's it called?"Controling Men Made Easy!")The characters are very intresting esp. in their outer appearance.The whole game,even with the random enemies you fight,is created with a trippy,but very appealing artistic style.The gameplay is very typical and very easy to get the hang of, but that's not to say that it's boring.Both kids and adults will have fun with Okage.The soundtrack was pretty good,sometimes a little goofy,but never annoying.My favorite track was when the game first opened up with the bagpipes at the title screen!I think 90% of the people who would play this game would have fun with it and enjoy it alot,esp if you had fun with the Super Nes RPG "Earthbound".It's funny,quirky,kinda off-beat but strangely addicting and alot of fun.To me Okage is a great break from certain RPG video games that take themselves SOOOOOOO seriously(cough!Final Fantasy-cough!)This is a game that you can play while relaxing in your favorite recliner and munching on the junkfood of your choice!Enjoy it,laugh and have fun....isn't that what video games are supposed to be about??

Hey all this is Sam AKA Para in the gaming review community. This is one of many gaming reviews I will be starting for Amazon, so I hope you enjoy. Going to be talking about LittleBigPlanet and LittleBigPlanet GOTY Edition and what I think is a SUPER AWESOME game. First off let's talk about the story which I have to say is fun and funny at the same time. It is so enjoyable to lay solo but with friends it is just so much more fun. The cut scenes are just hilarious at times and you are always wondering what they will think of next. It is just a well written story that is fun to play and see how it unfolds.Now for the gameplay, it was nice visually and audio wise. I just love the customization of each sack boy/girl. The way they implemented the motion control if neat, love doing the pelvic thrust LOL. The controls are so simple and could be learned while playing in minutes. As far as graphics go it is just superb. It is simple yet so detailed for a side scrolling game in a 3d world. You will be amazed at how the fire looks and just the overall stitching of your sack boy/girl. They look so real that you feel like that is your little pet and you don't want him to die in the fire or electric lol. Also the audio sound effects are a blast. Fire sounds real, the sack person getting burned is so funny and when they touch electric and pop, hilarious. There is just so much to do in this game that it will keep you playing and playing. With the game creation tools you will have endless gameplay here. I will talk more about that in the online/multiplayer section, which is next.Now for online/multiplayer which I can say is fun, let me rephrase that, it is over the top enjoyable and will have you playing for hours and not even know it. Playing with friends is so fun and funny that you will want to slap your friend over and over, I mean in the game not for real HAHA. Yes you can actually move the sack persons hands too and slap friends to the floor, wave to them, or even give them the finger.......well not that part but it is still funny. Online is a bit laggy though at times and getting into a game sometimes sticks because it might throw you in a game that is finishing or finished. Don't let the frighten you though, if you get a good connection to a game stick with those players cause it will be fun. Now for the creating, creating your own level is easy, there is a nice tutorial that is very helpful and will teach you the basics with some advanced stuff to. But it really all comes to your imagination. There are so many fun levels to play from Mario recreations to Music songs which is just mind blowing of how these players create this stuff. They really have made a game that has so much replay value and it is great to see the gaming community taking part in this. Also they have some fun add-ons like the Metal Gear Solid with the paint gun, which is a blast, literally.Overall Sony/MM has done a great job on the game and it will be played for years to come.Score out of 5Concept/Story: 5*, So fun and funny you will keep playing over and over trying to collect everything from the levels and figuring out new ways to complete the level.Graphics: 5*, For a side scrolling game with 3d implications this is the best. Everything has high details and you will think that sometimes you can see the strip of your sack person coming off after a bad death lol. Also the camera angles are so well placed that it makes the game much easier to play.Sound: 5*, With great graphics you must have great sound effects and they have pulled it off flawlessly.Entertainment Value: 5*, Fun with friends and even solo. I have to say though more enjoyable with friends and just having a good time goofing off.Control: 5*, Not really hard to learn.Replay Value: 5*, Playing with friends just makes this game so replayable but being able to create your own levels or play community levels makes this game endless for replay value.Thank you for your time, hope this review helps with your decision to buy the game. Take my word or don't take it, but this is a game you will be happy with purchasing.

I am confused by some of some of the other reviews. I was expecting this game to be really hard, especially for me because I am not very good at solving puzzles and trying to figure things out. I don't even have much(if any) experience with these kinds of games. The games I owned before I got this was Simpsons Road Rage, Simpsons Hit and Run, American Idol ect.......... My point is no games like Siren. I thought it looked good so I got it. I have had it for 3 days and am on mission 8 or 9 and the game play time is about 3 hrs. What I am surprised about is that I saw a review that was saying it's so hard, and you die so much. I am not even good at these kinds of games, and I have rarely died. I feel that the puzzles in this game make it so much more fun, and in my opinion the puzzles are not even hard(if you can even call them puzzles). I also love(although sometimes hard) when you are trying to sneak around the 'shibito's'. I am really surprised to see that some people say that it is SO hard when at the few games like this(ones where you have to find certain items and stuff)that I HAVE played I am usually terrible at, when this one didn't seem that hard at all! I also saw that someone said they couldn't find an item to smash the gate in the level with the 70 y/o man. I had the same problem, so I did a little more searching in an area I hadn't gone to yet, and instantly found a key on the ground right next to a gate, and got through the level. I think people make themselves think it's harder then it is when really it's quite simple. There is ALWAYS a way through the level you just have to search everywhere and you WILL find what it is you need. Overall I think this game IS challenging but the challenges are fun! The cahllenges can be frustrating at times, but the challenges are what makes this game! You have to be patient at times waiting for the 'shibito' to be in the right place to not spot you so you can sneak around them. So if you are an impatient person(which I generally am with games) then this may not be the one for you, but give it chance, because this really is a GREAT game!One more point. I don't mind the voice acting at all! Some people didn't like it. I thought it was really quite good actually. This game is a great price! It's worth WAY MORE! GIVE IT A CHANCE AND BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Let me start by saying there is NOTHING like Little Big Planet on the market.  Some game are innovative but not very good.  Some games are  AWESOME but not very innovative.  Little Big Planet is one of those rare games that is totally innovative, and totally awesome.It starts with Sackboy.  He is the new face of PlayStation at the moment.  He is completely lovable and just a great character all around.  You can make your Sackboy your own.  Decorate him or her with stickers, dress him or her up, do whatever you want to make him your own personal creation.After you have done that, you can play one of over 60 premade levels that are brilliantly created and full of life.  You can play with up to 4 people online or offline.  One of the coolest things I think is that I will be playing a level, and all of a sudden a friend of mine will jump in the game with me mid level, and we can talk over headsets and solve puzzles together.Next, you take your Sackboy (and up to 3 friends) and go into create mode.  You can used seemingly hundreds of tools, stickers, options, and sounds to create your own levels!  (You will be able to create levels with online friends in a future update.)  There is tons of space for your creations, and you will be amazed at what you can build.  The in-game tutorials make learning how to create your own levels a breeze, so don't worry about not being able to do it (its simple, yet time consuming).After you have made your level, you can publish online for others to play!  You will get feedback from others on how they liked your levels and how to improve them.  Watch your level climb the rankings of most played of most favorited level.  It's addicting!Also, you can play others creations online.  There are many brilliant levels online and they are so much fun to play.  This means the game is pretty much never ending.  There is ALWAYS new content that is free because it is made by other people!  And don't forget, you can always play these levels with your online friends or up to four people in your house!There is so much to this game . . . too much to explain in a review.  I hope you give it a chance even if you think it looks too kiddy or too complicated.  You won't regret it.
I didn't have a chance to play Little Big Planet yet but my 2 boys seem to be enjoying the game immensely. The 5-star ratings are theirs, not mine and, below, is my junior's own review. He assumes that everyone has a general idea of what the game is about and how it's played so you'll only get  his views on the game.___________________________________Little big Planet is a great game made by creative people that think outside the box.The game is about getting your little sack person through levels and getting as many items and look as best as you can on your way to the ending by dressing it up and by collecting items. There's always something new if you explore and the more stuff you visit the more staff you can use to build your own level and put stickers on things.Story mode is an ok part of the game, the levels are very creative and the graphics are some of the best I have seen. The puzzles are always changing with many fun things you could do to solve them. Story mode overall can keep you entertained until you finish it.The two-player mode was a good idea at first but soon it got really competitive and started to mess other people up. The 2 player puzzles were a good idea but if either one of the players got greedy then it would take both of them a while to complete it. If there were two screens then it would be a lot easier and then the players could go as far away from each other as possible and not mess each other up.Multi-player mode is a lot better than the two-player mode because the people that play are not usually competitive and they want you to be their friend. Also when you are in two-player mode you can follow the hosts around and even look at their unfinished levels before they are published into the game. If they are more experienced than you then they can give you plenty of tips on story mode and in building mode. If you are the more experienced one then you have a chance to feel like the professional and teach them many things that they didn't know yet. Overall the multi player mode was a great touch to the game.I would recommend this game to children with creative minds but it can be played by people of all ages.
This game lives up to all the hype!  My kids (5 and 7) and I have been watching the videos for this game on Playstation Network for months now and have counted down the days 'till its release (which was frustrating because it was delayed!).  I can tell you that the game is worth every bit of the wait.  We can't get enough of it!  Following the story line and collecting the "reward bubbles" while building to your sticker/costume/object collections is simple, but exraordinarily fun.  A lot of the bubbles are cleaverly hidden and take some puzzle solving to access.  The visuals, story and music (they should release a CD with the game music, I'd be first in line!) is addictive, and that's just a small aspect of the game!We have gone online and played a number of the levels created by users.  It's like a never ending game!  Some of the user levels are as good (possibly better...) than the story levels.  You can also join up with friends online to play through any aspect of the game (haven't tried this yet).Lastly you can create your own levels - either for personal use or to publish online.  My kids were amazed when I created a simple level that had their names as part of the scenery.  Not sure if I'll every have the time to create something good enough to publish, but fun for those who do.There is also downloadable content on PSN now (some is free).  I added a couple of costumes for my kids to use, my son loves the gorilla and daughter likes the penguin.Although I've referred to my kids in this review a number of times, don't think the game is just for them.  I play it just as much without them!  If you're looking for a unique game that is a simple concept, yet superbly done, this is the answer.  It's my vote for game of the year 2008!
This game is visually stunning and could actually be a lot of fun...HAD THEY GOTTEN THE CONTROLS DOWN RIGHT!  Trying to play this game is frustrating to no end because you have to struggle with the weird 2.5-D perspective which makes moving between the foreground and background an absolute chore.  Jumping is also way more frustrating than it could or should be.  I just don't get why they couldn't tweak the controls to make them more crisp and predictable.  The game ends up being hard not because it's actually hard but because of the bad controls!  FRUSTRATING!!!  One other minor thing I absolutely hate and would like to mention is that BLINDING white screen you get every time you finish a level and return to your pod.  I literally have to close my eyes and turn my head away from the screen every single time, it's so insanely bright.  That gets a little bit old.Edit: I'm upping my previous 3-star rating to 5 on this game because I've forced myself to keep on playing it despite the control issues and it's actually a great deal of fun!  I've probably played this game for more hours than any other game I've ever owned and I want Mm to continue creating sequels!!  You kind of get used to the bad controls and start to anticipate them, sadly.  Overall I've had a blast with this game, especially online (although this game seems to be a magnet for little kids!)
I play a lot of games... probably too many. Although I come back to several games every now and then for nostalgia I am sure I will be playing this game regularly for as long as I play video games. Not only is the single player game great but the community makes this game infinitely playable with a constantly evolving catalog of levels.But the best thing about this game is that you don't have to love video games to love this game. I recently played it with my brother who just got back from Germany and he absolutely loved it. Keep in mind my brother declared all video games a "massive waste of time" and "totally stupid" somewhere during his sophomore year of college, right after he met his future wife...hmmm. Anyway, he couldn't help but have a blast playing this game! HE could barely contain his laughter and hes 27 and just got out of the Army.Meanwhile this game offers a lot of challenge for skilled players, especially veteran platformer-players who have been looking for a new style of play in an old genre. Some of the player-created levels are so hard they border on impossible, and that's the best part... you know it before you even play it, you can find the level that is perfect for you... easy and goofy or wicked hard but rewarding (getting the high score on one of those harder levels is very satisfying)When I am no playing harder levels or a fun easier level with my family and friends I entertain myself by simply looking up levels based on "i like ghostbusters... lets see if there are any cool levels based on it" and sure enough there are... lots of em!Despite a rather robust game collection I keep coming back to this one again and again! It's basically the perfect game for everyone thanks to the level creater. Did I mention how fun it is to make your own levels? When you get this great game try mine called Little Big Galaxy (my PSN is Sharpshell)although I warn you its on the harder side.The single player itself is an amazing game with or without the online community. The Developers chose to invent there own style for the game mechanics which work well in the game rather than simply make a Mario clone. It offers a lot of ability to master the game. And for those who like the specs let me reassure you that:Graffix: 5/5Sound: 6/5 (honestly the sound in this game is beyond top notch, and Stephen Fry is hilarious)Gameplay: 5/5Multiplayer: 5/5I can't really say anymore when all you need to do is order this game! You love this game unless you eithera)hate all video games orb)can't enjoy yourself unless your slaughtering thousands of people and even if that's your thing keep and open mind and you'll find some levels perfect for you- I suggest the Resident Evil inspired levels)
Ok, I'm going to be honest.  I LOVED the first Uncharted, and I actually bought it used, because well it was cheap, and I never really heard of it.  Well, that game was AWESOME!!  Hands down one of the best games I've played in a LONG TIME.  Second game came out, and I want it, but wanted to save money and buy it used again.  Well, I just happen to hear, that sales are not as great as they publishers hoped, so I'm calling out to all gamers who buy used games, and not buy this game used!!  BUY IT NEW!  If they make a Near Perfect game, and it doesn't sell well we got no one to blame but ourselves when we get junk games.  I got caught in the hype and bought Modern Warfare 2, and well, I still haven't beat the game, and the story line, wellll.. sucked.  It sells like hotcakes!  Not saying, it's a bad game, but all I'm saying is Uncharted 2 not only deserves  to sell a trillion games, but it earned it from all the hard work they put into it.  I'm BUYING new tomorrow, and I hope that other people will too.  Pass this one if you want, but seriously, don't you want more great games like this??Update.... Guess the game is about to hit 3 million!!! Guess they are getting those sales a little later.  This GAME IS AWESOME.  I've play it over and over again.  The online mode is also very good!  I can't tell you how much you feel like your playing a movie.  The voice acting, and animation is very realistic.  If you own a PS3 you need to own this in your library.

It's ah good ole fashion ideal with ah twist. Bug Exterminatore goes marine, sent to a facility to do just that, exterminate some bugs, big, ugly, mutated bugs with a condatious virrus. I found the map of the facility to be small, the camera angles helpful but limited when needed, the storyline to be thrown togather like somekind of pilot for tv, and the graphics were excellent. It's very fun, surpriseing like a cartier vascalary attack and is out there like instatuted crazy people. I LOVED IT, 4 STARS BAY-BAH!!!!

Here's the short version.The game is truly addictive. Even with all the bugs, crashes to desktop, warm reboots, and all the other associated problems, you will find yourself coming back to this game again and again. This game will make you feel powerful and 10 minutes later you'll be screaming at the monitor over a wacky death.After having just finished my 1st week trial subscription (each full game comes with a special code, give it to your friends to try out for a week free) I have some lucid thoughts to put down here for anyone interested. The planet Auraxis is colonized by the enormous Terran Republic, but after the wormhole that transported this group here collapses the main populace soon begins to break apart into 3 separate factions. The Terran Republic (TR) loyalists, the New Conglomerate (NC), which is a group of revolutionaries that want freedom from the TR, and the Vanu Sovereignty (VS) that have embraced the technologies of an ancient race who have left thier artifacts behind. Because of the Vanu technology there is no permanent death here on Auraxis. You are basically reconstructed with nanites in a cloning tube where you can feel free to rejoin battle at any time over several different continents each with thier own terrain differences and climates.You begin at Battle Rank 1 (BR) and after training on the various weapons and discovering new systems you gain exp. Each new BR you achieve gives you Certification Points, which you can spend on several different options, like being able to drive certain tanks or aircraft, or to better customize yourself to infantry work. In addition to this you can gain Command Ranks, which give you the ability to organize and direct offense and defense on a truly global scale. Command Rank is much harder to achieve though, so by and large the average player you'll find concentrates almost solely on BR. If you don't like what you're certified in (you can't fly a plane to save your life or die remarkably quick in infantry positions) no worries, you're given the option to "forget" certain skill and apply them to new ones.Combat often gets chaotic, and as your skills improve you can deal out more harsh damage on the battlefield. There's nothing more gratifying than getting kills in this game, and the harder the kill it is the more exp. you get. As such battles get *very* big really quick as the experience points pour in. To describe the game itself though I'd have to say that it's a mixture of Team Fortress Classic, combined with a little bit of Deus Ex, and further mixed up with some Battlefield 1942. It's definitely unique and that's it's biggest draw.As for the problems, I won't lie. The game has terrible bug issues...the worst I've come across in my week's trial subscription were crashes to desktop. Those are annoyingly frequent (and due to some terribly bad luck) usually at a time when I need to be in the game the most. Other times the game will freeze without warning, requiring you to reboot. And still other times consoles don't work right, or weapons don't load up correctly. Sometimes you respawn not in a cloning chamber like you're supposed to, but in water, where you drown and die again.This game is made for a certain kind of game player. If you love First Person Shooters like Half-Life, Return to Castle Wolfenstein, or Battlefield 1942, you will love this game. If you liked Deus Ex you will probably like this game. If you like the above games but are over the age of 30 and don't like getting spanked regularly by highstrung 15 year olds with the gift of agility, you will hate this game, but you'll keep playing it, probably cursing the whole time as I did. There's also some imbalance in the game...actually there's one GIANT imbalance in the game. The VS Lasher, that faction's "special" weapon is overwhelmingly too powerful. So if you subscribe and join the VS you'll find conquests to be less challenging than you would with the TR or NC, save for nights when they're actually organized to do something.Someday I'll buy the full version of Planetside...it's a really entertaining (and ludicrously enfuriating at the same time) romp from SOE. You may want to wait a month or two for the worst of the bugs to get worked out, but if you can't wait that long I can't blame you.
Here's the short version.The game is truly addictive. Even with all the bugs, crashes to desktop, warm reboots, and all the other associated problems, you will find yourself coming back to this game again and again. This game will make you feel powerful and 10 minutes later you'll be screaming at the monitor over a wacky death.After having just finished my 1st week trial subscription (each full game comes with a special code, give it to your friends to try out for a week free) I have some lucid thoughts to put down here for anyone interested. The planet Auraxis is colonized by the enormous Terran Republic, but after the wormhole that transported this group here collapses the main populace soon begins to break apart into 3 separate factions. The Terran Republic (TR) loyalists, the New Conglomerate (NC), which is a group of revolutionaries that want freedom from the TR, and the Vanu Sovereignty (VS) that have embraced the technologies of an ancient race who have left thier artifacts behind. Because of the Vanu technology there is no permanent death here on Auraxis.

Huge fan so my review is biased, just wanted to say that if your only reason to buy games is for "the graphics", then this probably is not the game for you. EQ's engine is a bit dated, but I'm not a huge fan of flash over substance.Everyone concerned with the requirements for the new engine, let me just restate what people have said before me, the engine is scaleable. Yes, you can still run this game on a high end p2/celeron with 128megs ram as long as your video card supports Dx8 (usually a free driver update is all you need), but really people, with semi-decent low end GeForce Cards going for [money] and RAM at [money] for 256Megs, what's your excuse for not upgrading? More RAM = Less Disk Swaps = Happier Computer Verant Recommends 512Megs, bit high, but check out the next gen games coming out. Even the Sims Vacation (a seriously old game, but a GOOD game) requires a P2/300 now (used to be a Pentium 233 Minimum).Verant customer support is only negative thanks to the Internet, anyone that's accidentally destroyed an item then gone postal at Verant demanding this or demanding that ends up getting the "book" thrown at them (Verant documents their item replacement policy very explicitly on everquestlive.com). I've had the occasional problems, but I've found that a /petition and a polite email to the powers that be will get the items replaced. Granted it may take time, but I have much respect for the "Guides" and "GMs" on EQ (Customer Support), they work hard for little thanks and every one of them is a pretty cool person.You get out of the game what you put into it. There is a lot of depth and substance in EQ, problem is that it's not conveyed really well, but if you have no life and a lot of spare time on your hands the world of Norrath is quite fun to explore and hang with people.Remember, this game can be highly addictive, and even after 3 years with 3 (soon to be 4) expansions it's still hard to put down. Some other things to remember:- Verant doesn't control the Internet. If you get Lag in the game do something about it. Call your ISP, run a "Trace Route" on your connection. Not all ISPs are created equally, get out there, do the research, find the BEST ISP for gaming and that'll probably help. You get out of the Internet what you put into it.- Bugs are in the game, but there are bugs in every game out there, believe me.- DAoC - Played it, loved it, stopped playing at level 30, why, BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO DO! Graphics are nice, I love the setting, but darn if I wasn't bored outta my skull. (Yes, I'm an EQ fan, but like I said, DAoC is a great game)- I'm a Beta2 tester from EQ (Verant had 3.5 Beta rounds with EverQuest where we got to wander around and help with bug finding), and I still play.

After beating Gnasty Gnorc, Spyro is ready for a nice relaxing vacation. He and Sparx set their sights on Dragon Shores, a sunny resort world. Meanwhile, in the world of Avalar, a small mole known as the Professor (along with Elora the faun and Hunter the cheetah) is programming a portal to transport a dragon to their realm. The Professor has recently made a big goof and transported the dinosaur Ripto and his cronies Crush and Gulp to Avalar. Ripto, detecting no dragons in the area, has decided to take over and make himself king of the realms. Spyro and Sparx gallop into the portal for Dragon Shores, only to end up in the Avalar realm of Glimmer. The trio brief him on the situation before Spyro begins his journey, ready to flame broil every enemy that stands in his way!The attacks are the same as the first game, your charge and flame. At certain points in the game there are powerup portals that allow different types of abilities in game. There is a flight powerup, a superflame powerup, and an invincibility powerup. Each of these will run out after about thirty seconds or so, and faster if you get too far out of range. Sparx is still your health meter, and there is plenty of colorful fodder around to keep you healthy. The levels are just as colorful and interesting as last time, although rather than dropping gems, your enemies release a sort of shining soul when they're released that will unlock the powerups. Your progress is saved by yet another new character, Zoe the fairy, who zaps you with her wand; if you lose a life, you return to the last location Zoe zapped you.Your main goal in each level is to collect orbs, which in turn unlock other levels, and talismans, the magic of which unlock boss battles. Orbs are scattered throughout the realms, as well as won in side quests and minigames. After Ripto is defeated, a certain number of gems and orbs is needed in order to unlock Spyro's original destination, Dragon Shores.This is a fantastic sequel to the original Spyro The Dragon, almost all of my favorite levels are in this game! I have a particular attachment to Scorch and Shady Oasis.

As a big Crash fan, I could not help but love this game. Not as good as Crash Bash because it's too easy but enjoying all the way. Another Naughty Dog classic with your favorite bandicoot in it along with Dr Neo Cortex, Tiny Tiger, Coco, N. Gin, Dingodile, Polar, Pura, Ripper Roo, Papu Papu, Komodo Joe, Pinstripe, Fake Crash, Penta Penguin, and more. I can't wait until Crash Nitro Kart, the game that will be coming for the Playstation 2. Two thumbs up! Plus, it's one of the games that does not get tiring. As Dingodile would say, G'Bye!

I was searching through the booklet and came across the name "David Kaye," I thought I've seen this name before, so I went here to find out more. After searching Metal Gear Solid and finding out that the Ninja is played by Pinky from Pinky and the Brain and that Liquid Snake was Ryudo in Grandia 2, i search this game and there it was: David Kaye as Clark.

Spyro: Year of the Dragon is the best title out of the Spyro trilogies including Spyro and Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage. There's so much colorful and interesting characters. My favorite is Sheila, the friendly kangaroo from The Land Down Under. There's also a laser blasting space monkey and a yeti. Levels are graphically lush and it's great to see a Playstation game whose graphics are far superior to that of any other console.

A few of the levels in this game aren't medievil,such as the gardens,the observatory,the academy,and the museum.But some such as the tomb,hall,sewer,cathedral are.Perhaps that's the only problem.You can play as DanHand,half head,half hand to get into small passages too.You also go boxing,when Sir Dan's friend,The Professer puts it on a Frankenstein-like body.You can even play without Sir Dan's skull on.And in the tomb you have to solve a puzzle of rescuing the Egyptian princess,Kiya.The main plot is that your favorite skeleton knight is awakened by a mad wizard named Palethorn,with the pages of Zarok,(remember that big chinned dress wearing madman who trapped the mayor,awakened the dead zombies,and tried his best to kill Sir Dan?) So Dan is awakened to attack the awakened dead.This game may be challenging though.And also you know,I suggest you buy the strategy guide.Get this game,it's fun.

When Jen Tate and her rock star boyfriend leave a wild dance hall to go pay the rent, the last thing they expect is to be attacked and beaten within an inch of their lives by a gigantic demon.  Lying in an emergency recovery room, Jen leaves her body and meets Scree, a gargoyle turned guide, and is drawn into Oblivion and the center of the demonic worlds where chaos and order fight a continuous battle.  Unfortunately, chaos is winning, and it will take Jen's special powers to restore the balance.Jen and Scree work their ways through four different demon realms all superbly detailed, restoring or creating order and improving their skills for the last titanic fight.  The game requires equal amounts of battle skills and thought - Only Jen can fight, but it takes Scree's talents as well to overcome some of the ingenious obstacles in their path. As the game progresses, Jen acquires special demonic powers in each realm.  The player switches between the to characters - depending on what skills are needed.Primal is a winner at many levels.  The characters, Jen and Scree, are delightful.  Jen is a rocker who is determined to work her way up and make good.  Scree, a spirit torn from his body and thrust into a statue, plays the part of the wise straight man.  The dialog between them is full of little twists and barbs, but it is clear that a great deal of affection builds between them as the story evolves.The realms of the story are immense and beautifully illustrated; their civilizations believable and interesting.  The only flaw in the world building is that there are only a few characters other than Jen and Scree that achieve any personality.  Animation and movement control are excellent.  This isn't one of those RPG's where the controller is the real opponent.Primal is rated as mature - primarily due to blood and violence.  Jen's language has a rough edge as well.  From my viewpoint, none of these factors is extreme - parts don't go flying everywhere, etc., but the Primal is definitely pitched to the 15+ age group.  Even so, this is really too good a game to miss.

Primal progresses through four realms in the Parallel world of Oblivion. In Each realm her appearence changes dramatically and each realm is ruled by either the forces of order or chaos, and something major is messing up the balance.Unusually, unlike other games, which claim to be deep and fantastical and try to be as complex and open-ended as possible, Primal sesigners have devised a storyline, which is stuck to throughout the game, wearing it's linear nature with pride.Reasons for buying it:-Deep, dark and huge.-Broad, intultive puzzles.-Very nasty monsters.Reasons for leaving it:-Vague sense of being unfaithful to Mrs Croft-Not a game that gets along with natural light.-Where's the mini-gun?(AS YOU SEE DIGGING HARD FOR BAD POINTS!)Graphics/visuals: Gorgeous. Slinky characters, near-edible textures!9.4/10Sound: Alf soaring and dramatic. Decent acting!8.9/10Gameplay: Simple, fun. Combat a teeny bit simplistic.8.2/10Life span: Huge and linear. The save-anywhere option is great.8.6/10OVERALL SCORE AND THOUGHTS:I give this 8.8/10 (88%)-A finely crafted adventure, which reveals its depths gradually, unfolding at a pace to suit even the most fantasy-challenged.

For this to be the first game from Studio Cambridge(developers of the successful Medievil series)for the Playstation 2, I must say I'm really impressed with what they've accomplished. Being a fan of the more Darker third-person action adventure games out there, I was drawn to play Primal and I wasn't disappointed. This game reeks with atmosphere. You can't help but be enchanted by all the realms you visit. They are absolutely, undeniably gorgeous. Really giving the architecture and graphics of some Xbox titles a run for their money. You play as Jen who travels to four different demon realms with her friend, Scree, in search of her boyfriend: Lewis. The more you play as Jen, the more you find out about her and the sooner you find out that there is more to her than meets the eye. I have to admit, I'm intrigued by her character and want to know even more about her.This game is slow-paced, which will prove taxing to those with lil or no patience, but if you can manage to see things through til the end- You'll get a rich and rewarding experience. There's unlockable DVD extras to be had and more.Primal sports greatness and is sure to be a sleeper hit. Even more, it's sure to be to be a classic game in your PS2 library. Primal is one compelling, wildly addictive game worth recommending to all.

The more you play as Jen, the more you find out about her and the sooner you find out that there is more to her than meets the eye. I have to admit, I'm intrigued by her character and want to know even more about her.This game is slow-paced, which will prove taxing to those with lil or no patience, but if you can manage to see things through til the end- You'll get a rich and rewarding experience. There's unlockable DVD extras to be had and more.Primal sports greatness and is sure to be a sleeper hit. Even more, it's sure to be to be a classic game in your PS2 library. Primal is one compelling, wildly addictive game worth recommending to all.
*illustrative story* You slide slowly along a crevassed wall, muffled sword bumping gently against your side.  The dulled clang of armored feet rings falsely in your ears, an obvious trick of echo that could lead to a mistake your training would never allow.  Your exhilaration rises with the jangled din, an opportunity you will not allow to pass.  At the critical moment, you spring around the corner, grab your unsuspecting victim--muting his tell-tale screams with your swathed hand--pin him against the rough wall, and swiftly stab your sword into his caved throat, silencing all struggles. He slumps to the floor, a sightless, disgarded husk.*/illustrative story*And this only describes the heart-racing feeling one should feel when performing a stealth kill!  Imagine what an all-out brawl would inspire...this game, a work of deadly beauty, gaming bliss.  I could describe the game mechanics in detail, but the synopsis already here does this well-enough.  So I decided, "why not try to describe to people actually playing the game feels like?"  Though I slightly exaggerated my description (in-game sound does not work in so sophisticated a way, but one can certainly imagine), I sincerely felt this way when playing.  This game allows one to enter the body of a true brawler, one very capable and quite impressive to play.The gameplay never became boring because the player has numerous weapons at her or his disposal and areas to explore.  In this respect, I felt the game's short length actually worked to its advantage:  how can one become tired of an excellent game that only lasts about 8-10 hours?  The developers included much without having to resort to game-lengthing repetition.  Though I desired more, this left me craving and only feeling residual sweetness...nothing marred my experience.  This says something strong, I believe.Considering this game's reasonable price, I highly recommend all who read this purchase it.  I found it for $30, and never once regretted my buy.

-Chad Steingraber--Paradigm/Infogrames--Level Designer/Game Designer/3D Artist on The Terminator: Dawn of Fate-This is one of those games that I had fun playing through the entire game.  There were a few moments of complete frustration where I had to put it down and come back the next day...but it was worth it.  I didn't find anything to be repeatative or boring.  It brought me back to when I first bought a DreamCast and played RayMan 2.  I would definately suggest this game to anyone who likes action/adventure/platform styles games...it's a lot of fun.  I gave it four stars because of some of the frustration I encounted.  More than just a rental, this game will take you a little while (unless, you play it all weekend or can rent it for 7 days...then it's a rental).  Unless you are crazy insane for this game, you will only need to play it once.  I traded mine in for Drakan after I was done.

Before I go into my review, I'd like to point out that some people reviewing the game seem to have done so without PLAYING the game.  One review talks about "stragglers, some of which can transform."  No one in this game except Ryu can transform.  That reviewer also states that the game is a continuation of the ongoing BOF storyline, which it isn't at all, as the Goddess Myria has nothing to do with this game.  Another reviewer mentions that the game has only 8 directional control, unlike the Final Fantasy games.  Well, that'd be because the game uses 2D sprites, not 3D models, and for every angle there has to be a different sprite.  Unlimited directions simply are not possible in a 2D game - even if it's on a 3D background.  Moving on...What Breath of Fire IV has that so many RPGs lack, is a solid, coherent story that doesn't rely on the Japanese convention of pseudo-philosophical and over-convoluted mish-mash.  The characters are fleshed out pretty well, some better than others, but all with some measure of substance.The battle system is brilliant - following the standard formula enough to make it simple for newcomers to the series or genre to jump right in, but adding enough complexity to reward the long-time RPGers who crave a little something extra.  The combo system and all of the variations on the standard attacks that it creates make combat much more interesting.The character animations for combat and cut scenes are incredible.  Capcom used 3,000 frames of animation for every major character, which is simply unheard of in 2D games, and the pastel art style makes them well-integrated into the 3D backgrounds.  And speaking of those backgrounds, there is a lot more attention to detail in every location, from small meaningless objects in random rooms to the splendor of the Emperor's Palace.  This game is - for its generation - simply gorgeous.The music is of collectible quality - Yoshino Aoki delivers a performance that makes the rather odd jazzy tracks of Breath of Fire III a distant memory, and puts her on the same tier as some of the bigger name composers.  The eastern-influenced themes go well with the overall Asian aesthetic, making the games various elements gel together seamlessly to provide complete immersion.I really can't say enough about this game, but my final words are simply this:  Buy it.

Okay, caveat emptor right here at the beginning, my eyes and vision, as well as other related physical and psychological limits are going downhill fast, in this, mad world, and I don't have nearly the time or ability I'd like to playing video games more often.  While I still think video game technologies and advancements have come a long way indeed, in barely a decade, a lot of the newer, FPS (first person shooter) games for the up-to-the-minute game consoles and PC, so popular these days (unhappily), leave me cold.  Rare is it these days, that a video game shows any imagination besides the same old tired shoot everything that moves genre.  With lots of gratuitous blood and guts and lots of very unpleasant events (GTA, et al), and silly music games offered with silly fake instruments and even more ridiculous results (folks, buy a cheap, REAL guitar, sheesh, learn a few chords, and let your imagination take you wherever), I wonder, even with PSP and Nintendo DS confusion, whatever happened to having FUN playing video games?I remember in the early days of the PSP, which I had considered buying at one time due to my vision problems, where early on, there were cracks and hacks out there, and even pushed by hosts of G4TV, back before G4TV turned to crap and got rid of most of their best shows, which allowed me to actually play Mario and countless other SNES and Sega Genesis, and other games.  I don't know if it's even possible to buy PSP's hackable version  to play old SNES and/or Sega Genesis classics, "THEY" probably put an end to that a long time ago.I, the humble, lower economic class owner of my beloved PS2, thus offer the following.While XBOX360/PS3/Wii fans may either live in nirvana of the new dayz or even long for a better (?) time, some of us older others remember and applaud when the GAME and PLAYABILITY was all important.  For us, so many of the "next-generation" efforts in the way of graphics, are amazing but it's "in the game" beyond graphics, and so is the case with earlier efforts such as this, Good old Sly Cooper, in his original adventure.Dazzling graphics are one thing, and this game equals anything found on the newer (post-PS2), if I many say so.  The colors and graphics here are second to none.  And while deep down, I still believe the first three original Super Mario games, and Mario World, all for the SNES, still define the height console video games ever reached, this particular game, perhaps like Mario 64 and other such, questions that theory/belief.  Not that other platform games, 2D or 3D haven't tried.  Witness Spyro, Rayman, and Crash Bandicoot, etc., for examples.  Take these general opinions and my personal philosophy of video games, for what its' worth.  But for any platform game lover, this is a must buy if you have a PS2 or PS3 capable of playing older PS games.While I cannot talk of the Gamecube or Wii endeavors with Mario, since I've never owned those gaming systems, I do own and have for some time, a good ol' new version of the PS2 (which may never die, Thank God), and of all platform games I've played for the PS1 and PS2,  this has to be closer to one of the best platform games of all time, and will I'm sure, not let down any casual gamer of any age.  Experienced gamers might find it a bit easy, but that is to be expected among most gamers.Sly Cooper is a sly fox, yes he is.  If one gets lost early on, as I did, I suggest you delete your saved profile(s), and start anew.  Because there can be frustrations early on if you don't watch and listen to your help characters, from beginning onwards through each completed stage.  Regardless of similar such games as this, this is fun and easy for all ages, and remains the best SLY COOPER game ever, and probably always will.  For any PS2 game player not familiar with Sly and his merry bunch of accomplices and beautifully drawn and colored graphics, and especially for any true fan of platform 3D games, this game remains one of the finest and most excellent overall platform games ever.If you can still play PS2 games on whatever system(s) you  own, and want a good, old-fashioned platform game, which is actually relaxing (no real timers hurrying you along) and easy but still challenging and quite cute at times without being unnecessarily frustrating, with superb graphics and replayability, you can't go wrong here.  This is definitely one of the PS2's finest efforts, and still holds up to this day, for both young and old gamers alike.  Dinosaur gamers like me with failing eyesight or cerebral ability to keep up with dozens of commands to make your onscreen character work, will love this, though advanced gamers, may find it the equivalent of one who mastered the Super Mario games trying to play Pong.Come to think of it though, Pong was, I still protest, a pretty cool game, and still is...as are the Super Mario games, and Tetris, and I'll just stop for now before I start discussing Ecco...

This is an action RPG that puts extreme emphasis on randomly generated dungeons.  The combat system is very simple, but fun.  You switch between two characters, both of whom have a melee and a projectile attack.  The pastel environments are lovely.  The semi-chibi human characters look great and move wonderfully, as do the all the different beasties, of which there are an enormous number.  The music is downright hypnotic.  The game has a nifty little fantasy steampunk milieu going on, but the story is unfortunately very stupid, which is the case with every LEVEL-5 RPG except Dragon Quest VIII.  Dark Cloud 2 would have rated a solid 5 if the narrative were better.Should you play this?  If you like long, relaxing dungeon hacks and cute, cartoon graphics, then yes.  I found this game to be so soothing that it made my blood pressure hit the floor and even cured a bout of constipation I had.

Let's get one thing straight: I've never given two shakes about golf, either in real-life or video game form.  I'd never played a golf game until Hot Shots Golf 3.  This review will show my lack of knowledge about the sport, and will contain no comparisons to Swing Away Golf, Tiger Woods 2002, Tee Off Golf, or even the first two Hot Shots games, because I've never spent one second playing any of them.  In fact, being Golf Ignoramus #1, I may seem like the least qualified person in the universe to review this game.However, HSG3 is not a golf game just for golf-heads.  It is fun, pure and simple - in fact, it's the most fun I've had with a game since Samba de Amigo and Virtua Tennis on the Dreamcast.  HSG3 is one of only two games I've ever pre-ordered; even now I'm really perplexed about what attracted me to it.  I was positive the game would be a winner.Lucky for me, I was right.  HSG3 makes golf fun and easy to play, yet contains enough depth to keep it from being silly.  It's a fantastic multiplayer game as well - my similarly golf-ignorant friends got involved immediately.  We now consider it a multiplayer classic.First off, the game is gorgeous to look at.  The characters have goofy, oversized heads, and behave in bizarre, endearing ways.  They'll do backflips when you get a birdy, and will even line-dance with some frogs.  The game is full of visual whimsy: a rainbow trail follows the ball on an accurate stroke, your caddy kicks up a puff of dust as he takes off after the ball, and the golf ball will even burst into flames on certain occasions.  The true stars of the game are the courses: lush, detail-filled marvels that are just magnificent.  I was actually disappointed my character couldn't hop in the golf cart and take a leisurely tour of the course, drinking in the grassy, rolling hills, the swaying trees, butterflies, falling leaves, rippling pools, and the glorious sunset.  You might see a windmill turning lazily in the distance, or a train chugging along a winding track.  You'll hear buzzing insects, soft gusts of wind...and your caddie's grating comments when you launch one into the rough.  The courses vary from a tropical island to a desert canyon, and each has its own treasures and obstacles.  You can play each course in any season, at different times of day, or with different weather conditions.  Not only does each detail provide an additional feast for the eyes, but each affects the gameplay directly.Ah, the gameplay.  HSG3 uses a three-click and meter system to measure your swing:  hit the button once to start the meter, again to measure power, and once more for timing.  You can also used the d-pad to target your swing for slice purposes.  It's ridiculously easy to do, but can get very complex, as you'll have to pay attention to the slope of the course, the wind condition, which club would be best, and of course you'll have to avoid sand traps and water.  Putting is also easy: a grid appears over the green showing slope and speed, and you tap the button once to start the meter and again to measure power.  A randomly placed pin practically guarantees you won't play the same hole twice.  &quot;Easy to get into, difficult to master&quot; is a gaming cliche, but it fits HSG3 perfectly.There are several single-player modes to choose from, including Practice, Stroke, Tournament, and Vs.  You accumulate Hot Shots Points in these modes, which can then be used in the Shop to buy items ranging from new clubs and balls to caddies.  Trust me - you'll revisit the courses many times in order to rack up additional points.  You play against the CPU in Vs. mode, and if you win, you unlock additional characters with improved performance stats.  There's also an interesting internet mode, which ranks your best games against players nationwide.Multiplayer is a joy.  One of the best features is that you can use one controller for up to four people - no multitap needed!  You can play one hole or compare your scores over a series.  Fiendishly addictive, and it can get pretty competitive!!Hot Shots is golf for the anti-golfer.  Despite having a total lack of interest in the sport, I got into the game right away.  It takes the somewhat slow-paced and dry game of golf and makes it appealing and fun.  HSG3 is a game you and your friends will replay many times, whether to improve your scores, purchase all the items, bask in the beauty of the courses, or to have a simple good time.  Ignore the golf-ish exterior and give it a chance.  I think you'll get hooked, unless you're dead-set against having fun.

As an owner of the last Tiger Woods on PS, my love first began then. Late nights turning to early mornings with a gang of friends who don't know how to go home at a decent hour. Tiger Woods PGA Tour is causing the same affect as the last. 6 friends gathering after work for a game of golf and they don't leave to go home until 3 or 4 a.m. This game has it all as far I'm concern when it comes to golf for a video game. None of us has ever picked up a club before but got madd skills when it comes to Tiger Woods PGA Tour. Graphics are much better and I love how this version makes you think more about what clubs to choose, chips verses punches and pitches, grass shots verses green shots. This is a must have for any golf head or those who wants to get a better understanding of golf.oNe
As an owner of the last Tiger Woods on PS, my love first began then. Late nights turning to early mornings with a gang of friends who don't know how to go home at a decent hour.

I love this game. It has all the elements of real golf, but far less challenging. I love that there are so many shot elements - you have to look at lie (buried, tight, sidehill, uphill, etc.), wind, ball position, hole location, obstacles, club selection, etc., just like in real golf. Adding spin or trying different shots is great. The courses are challenging, and there's a lot of risk-reward shots that make it fun to play as well.Add in the element of getting obtaining better clubs/balls, unlocking charac...Read full reviewters, working your way up the pro ranks, customizing your character's appearances, and building your player stats, and you have the makings of a very addictive video game.

Some people would think any series would die out after four titles, especially a golf game with two titles on the same system but after playing a demo of this and reading about it, its almost like a whole new game with many features makeing it worth buying. First of lets get started with the graphic/sound improvments. Hot shots golf three had great picture and sound but hot shots golf fore has considerable imporvement over those. The graphics are stunning with beutiful backgrounds and well drawn characters. The caracters are a little cartoonish but thats the way there supposed to be in hot shots golf. The sound is great from the plop of the ball when it hits the water to the bounce of the ball when it hits the fariway.Now lets talk about the new things they added. The most considerable notice is the much more wide selection of courses and characters. Theres an upgrade from the five courses in hot shots golf three to thirteen thats right thirteen courses (includeing the five from hot shots golf three revamped a little of course). Also theres a huge new selction of characters theres now 24 golfers to choose from (one is an animal the rest are humans) and theres now ten diffrent caddies (two are animals i know one of the animal caddies is a panda bear but im not sure about the other). Thats a HUGE new selction compared to what there was to choose from in hot shots golf three. Also new and one of the most exciteing features is the online tourniments were you can test your golfing skills with up to 31 players in an online tourniment exciteing eh? Also another big new feature, the return of putt putt golf. But its not your normal putt putt your up in the air or in crazy locations shooting shots that ricochet off of rocks or haveing to hit over narrow bridges with no rails on the sides! Your rewarded points in putt putt for the length of your shot and how many shots it takes to get in the hole. You can also play two player putt putt witch will be fun to challenger your putting skills.Lastly ill discuss the improvments in gameplay. The gameplay is enough the same to please old time players but slightly different to please them as well. It still goes by the three click method (press to get started press for length and press again for how straight and how much of the ditance youll get, easier done then said) but has different characters with different ways of hitting and new items to buy to customize the way you golf to make things different. Also theres a new easy mode where theres no third click so you always hit what you mean to for those newbies comeing into the game. Although it dose take a major challenge out of the game. With the new courses and characters it makes it a little funnier to play on new courses that present a new challenge or play as a different character to make a course easier or harder. With so many characters theres a character thats just right for one course and another just wrong for that same course. The gameplay is great maybe the best in any golf game and must be expreinced at least by renting the game. All in all this game is great it manages to keep its old glory that people love yet add new things people are sure to want to see improved or added in yet another sequel.

Long ago in ancient Greece where gods, sorcery and demons roamed there lived an ex-sparta named Kratos (Voiced by TC Carson) who was a living breathing slaughterhouse that made a deal with the god of war known as Ares (Voiced by Steve Blum) who made him slaughter his own wife and daughter thus he forever barred ashes on his skin from them magically forever. Now the time has came as the other gods like Zeus (voiced by Paul Eigin) are furious about what Ares is doing in Athens causing destruction and mayhem as they sent out Kratos to find Pandora's box in a way to destroy him as he must face other enemies on his way.co-starring the voices of Linda Hunt as the narrator and Rob Paulsen, this is the ultimate Playstation 2 adventure ever conceived. This brilliant mix of fantasy, slash-and-hack and action-adventure is a great combo for this game and has been a groundbreaker since 2005 when it debuted on the PS2. The game has originally in the gameplay and the story is obviously influenced by Greek mythology as if this was influenced by 1981's classic "Clash of the Titans" but with a fresh approach.  There are challenges that you must solve that aren't too hard at times and the visuals on the game characters are just incredible. There is some brief nudity and tons of graphic gory violence like ripping harpies apart with your blades as it's no kids game, there are other weapons you can use especially magic and tons of surpises. A must play game for any hardcore gamer!

On a journey that spans the agean seas, Athen and beyond, you must hunt down the god of war. Undead beasties, giant cyclopes and minotaurs all stand in your path, youll have fun crushing them with all the carfully designed flawless combo moves to bring down your enemies. If the mighty hydra or any other beast of ares proves daunting to you, you can bring them down with your combo moves. I f you like blody games this is the one for you. Like instead of just killing a bat like creature why not rip its head off or tear it appart with the blades of chaos. there over-flowing ammount of blood of each little bat like creature. God of war really makes you feal strong when you are a little wimp. With the ability to upgrade your weapons with little red orbs to make you even stronger than you already are is reallly fricking cool. God of war is filled with little puzzles and secrets to unslove. Playing it over and over is always a blast. I give 5 stars. And is runner-up for game of the year, behing half-life 2.

That's what I've started doing.  It's a game that drips testosterone from marble columns of Athens to (but not quenching) the infernals of Hades.  There's not much happy in Krato's Ancient Greece.  Well, strike that.  Maybe Aries is happy because he's ripping Athens to shreds.  Fires, thunderstorms, Aries' steel clanging, while the helpless humans fire arrows at the God of War unleashed.  Pah!  Human Arrows.  It's like trying to put out Hades' flames by blowing bubbles.There is so much amazing about God of War.  First, I'll talk about thought.  There's folly about.  That's the theme of Greek Mythology, ALWAYS.  Folly between the gods and "their human playthings".  However, Greek gods are flawed just like the human pawns.  For the gods of Olympus err clumbsiness then clean-up their mistakes after.  What folly!  God of War WORKS as Greek Mythology.  I love the concept of "destroying a god" through Pandora's Box.  Opening Pandora's Box, the colloquialism, is to unleash a maelstrom of unpredictable chaotic events.  Is that what happens when a god is killed?  Absolutely.  This is what I mean regarding thought.  There are philosphical gems that glisten in Ancient Greece.Second, the gameplay and controls are extremely tight.  You'll use every button on the contoller when battling.  You'll use every move.  Rolling/evasion, blocking, comboes that can rise to triple digit numbers (my highest is 124) are necessary to avoid becoming burger to Aries' black-hearted baddies.  This said, tight controls are necessary, work perfect, creating some ridiculously fast paced/intense action.Third, is balance.  Now some friends say I smoke too much over drinking, but I understand balance is required.  God of War balances action and puzzle solving, and not once do the scales dip to one side.  Sure, the game gets difficult and frustrating the further you take Kratos, but never is there too much fighting, too much puzzle-solving, or too much drinking.  Wah?  The balance is great.Did I mention level design?  No?  It's brilliant.  Sometimes it reminds me of Prince of Persia:SOT and sometimes Tomb Raider.  Environments are very fluid, from the details of statues and Greek architecture, to Kratos' ugly reflection on a highly polished floor?  I'd hate to be the sap who keeps those Greek floors so spickitty span clean.  I wonder what that dude makes an hour.  Benefits are worth it, especially if you get to glimpse the Oracle of Athens in her sheer top.  Huh?  Great level design.To add one more edge on Kratos already sharp blades, God of War has a wonderful soundtrack.  The music is ambiant sometimes, orchestral at others.  Should I say it again?  Ok.  Balanced soundtrack.I'll wrap it up.  My wife came down when I was playing and she said, "Honey, why do you have your shirt off?"  I looked at her.  My eyes were bloodshot but not from God of War.  I replied, "Kratos doesn't wear a shirt.  If he doesn't, I don't."

Set after the ending of "God of War II", legendary and very powerful former spartan warrior Kratos (Voiced by TC Carson) seeks his revenge on Zeus (Voiced by Corey Burton) and the other gods that betrayed him with the help of Gaia the Earth titan to trash Olympus. However Kratos has been sent to the underworld yet again where he must challenge Hades (Voiced by Clancy Brown) then afterwards must go back to the upperworld to fight other gods and monsters to bring an era of chaos and to bring the end of Zeus's reign.Co-starring the voices of Michael Mcdowell, Kevin Sorbo as Hercules, Adrienne Barbeau as Hermes, Linda Hunt, Elijah Wood and Rip Torn (Not as Zeus like in Disney's Hercules this time but as Mephistos) this is a sweeping finale of the epic fantasy action-adventure slash and dash game series. Here this series goes out with a bang as this installment brings more of the same moves but different combat uses and new hand weapons and powers when taking down gods and demons alike. The graphics are more realistic and better this time than the last two ones, there's even more visceral violence and gore with nudity abound plus an amusing tap button love test sequence which is quite amusing. What can i say? a well put together farewell to the series and if you can't get enough play the PSP prequels which both are heading to PS3 this september.The extras include making of Featurette and other featurettes and video clips from the game.
God of War begins with Kratos, a mysteriously ghost-pale Spartan, standing at the top of the highest mountain in all of Olympus, claiming that the Gods have abandoned him, and casting himself off the cliff towards his death. The game then rewinds three weeks. Kratos, betrayed by the only one he had left had begun traveling the Aegean Sea to ask for repentence for his sins. After ten years of serving the Gods, Kratos demands Athena finally rid him of his nightmares. Athena informs him that before his deeds can be forgiven, there is one final task that stands before him. Ares, the God of War, has seen fit to destroy Athens. However, Zeus, the King of the Gods, has forbidden the Gods to wage war on one another. She informs Kratos that it is because of that reason that he must be the one to kill Ares and save Athens. In order to do so, Kratos must find Pandora's Box, because only then will he have the power to kill Ares.Through his quest, Kratos will encounter many of the beasts and demons in Greek mythology, such as minotaurs and gorgons (for those who may be unfamiliar, Medusa was queen of the gorgons). Kratos will come to develop many powers which, along with his Blades of Chaos, include powers borrowed from the likes of Poseidon and Zeus. The gameplay is a great mix of puzzles and battle and the battles themselves come with a good deal of strategy to them, as well. God of War introduced the gaming world to what is known as "interactive cutscenes," during which a cutscene of a pre-scripted event (usually a kill) is shown, interrupted by a certain button popping up on-screen, which must be correctly entered to continue. If the incorrect button is entered or it is not pressed fast enough, Kratos will end up taking damage from the enemy. However, if correctly performed (except in the case of bosses, as they take more than one interactive cutscene), Kratos will come away with the kill. The other benefit to these is that certain enemies yield either health or magic orbs which, once collected, regenerate lost health or magic points. The game also has a ton of red "experience orbs," which can be used to upgrade both magic and weapons to deal more damage and learn new combinations.God of War is a technically superior game, as the graphics and sound are both top notch. The gameplay is as high on the scale as it can get, with the mix of puzzles, combat (both hectic and strategic), and especially the interactive cutscenes. With a number of different playable difficulties and a bevy of unlockables to go along with it, God of War is one game that should not be missed, and is certainly one of the best on the PS2. This is one of the few games in my life that I can honestly say I felt deserved a standing ovation when I finished it.Overall: 9.6Gameplay: 10Graphics: 9Sound: 9Value: 9Tilt: 10

When I bought BOF IV on its release, I was thoroughly unimpressed with the simple plot and rather poor graphics.However, being (as I am) temporarily broke, with the prospect of any new PS 2 games being but a distant horizon-blip, I decided to give it another go, and I have to say, I am delighted I did.BOF IV is not a game about technical bedazzlement or complicated quests with much philosophising. It is not a Final Fantasy game! Nor, in fifteen years' time, will it be remembered as a Classic, like the FInal Fantasies. But it's still an excellent homage to the early days of RPGs like Shining Wisdom, the original Zelda, and The Legend of Oasis games.Briefly, the plot: Cray and Princess Nina are investigating the disappearance of Nina's sister Elina, when they run across Ryu, a strange boy with no past and no direction. Their quest to find Elina and give Ryu a life takes them across several continents, accumulating a cast of memorable characters and unravelling a plot that involves Dragons, Civil War and theological Entities.What I am most impressed with is the simplicity and clarity with which BOF IV plays. Stylishly retro, the graphics are actually rather good - with more frames of animation and bigger, brighter characters than before - and some lovely spell effects. Everything is drawn in real-time, and the option to rotate the camera a full 360 degrees compensates much for the lousy camera angles one often runs across.The control system, too, is very easy to get to grips with and user-friendly - spells and abilities are learned and interchangeable - and the Combo system is a nice, innovative touch.The characters are decent, well-thought out personalities, but lack diversity. So far, so good.Sadly, BOF IV, like Onimusha after it, is just a little too far entrenched on the side of 'mundane' to be a truly memorable classic. It does take a good three or four hours of play time before the plot and characterisation picks up and by this time, you may well be unable to forgive the game its rather uninspiring opening. Similarly confusing, and dull, are the playable early sections starring Fou-Lu, the Laguna Loire to Ryo's Squall. Like the rest of the game, thankfully, these sections get progressively better, and by the end, you'll have formed an affectionate attachment to BOF IV.All in all, an excellent little title with one or two sadly fatal flaws that keep it from being a Classic, BOF IV is a definite reccommendation if you can get it cheap...

When I first heard of this game I was skeptic at first, this is because I had beaten all the other BOF games and those were okay, some of them kinda boring (3) but I was wrong! This game is amazing, one of the best RPG's on the playstation. This game is for people who like their rpgs simple but have certain quirks, like the fishing game, which you can use a special fishing rod control, and learning the enemys ablities. Also the plot and the characters rule, to the silent Scias to the funny robot thing, Ershin. The plot is great too, going between two different dragons. Buy this game right now, but, after you beat Final Fantsy IX ^_^

One of the best FPS for PS One.  Great graphics with a surround sound option.  Comtrols leave a bit to be desired as far as customization goes.  Not much for scares or surprizes and still mildly inferior to the legendary original.Highly recommended to anyone who still plays the old PS.Great shipping and condition of product.

Fans of the original Grand Theft auto and Grand Theft auto:2 and the gamplay that surrounded those games will be dissapointed and delighted.  The top-down, helicpoter viewpoint from the first two games has been revolutionized and revamped with stunning three dimentional graphics.  This is truly a go anywhere, do anything game.  You will find yourself roaming around the expansive city just exploring and sightseeing.  When you get the urge to, you can comit a few crimes and get involved in high-speed chases that offer edge-of-your-seat action.  The story of the game is there, but it's only purpose is to give you a reason for violent activity.  It does it's job well, though and pulls the gamer through a wonderfully rendered and intelligent enviroment with special missions and various things to accomplish.

This brilliant adventure game has Jen as an intelligent 21 year old woman who learns she has supernatural powers - and must use them to keep the world from ending.There are many ways in which this game shines. First and foremost, the plot and environment in which the adventure takes place has a huge attention to detail. Jen and her boyfriend are into the nightclub scene - he's a heavy metal singer - and the way in which the movie opens really draws you in. The club they're in looks exactly like a few I've been in.The characters are extremely realistic, smart and savvy. This isn't a brainless bimbo having to 'learn about life'. Sure, she doesn't know about her supernatural powers at first, but she's quick on the uptake and takes care of herself. This is definitely a chick that girls can look up to and that guys will want to get to know.Along comes Scree, a fun gargoyle that gives her a hand. The combination of Jen's abilities and Scree's special powers makes the puzzle solving and adventures even more fun, as you figure out which would be better in a situation. Yes, there's some fighting. But this is NOT a button-mashing game. The intro sequence definitely sets the pace. This is more like an interactive movie in which you actively affect the plot, rather than a run-around-gathering-coins brainless activity.There are different worlds and different characters you meet, and the PS2's graphics have really been tested in this game. The heat waves that rise from torches, the steamy breath in the wintery world, the reflective lighting, the detail on the characters - it's all extremely impressive and helps immerse you in the game.The sound is great too. Unlike other games that feel you need an action-packed thumping soundtrack while you explore a quiet environment, this game gives you the soft noises you'd expect - very realistic ones at that. It makes the times where something is jarring - like the snarl of a nearby monster - really affect you. The Heavy Metal thumping only jumps in during battles, where it doesn't seem intrusive.The game definitely isn't for the wham-bam-thank-you-maam type of gamer. Puzzles won't be solved in 3 seconds by jumping up platforms. You have to really examine your environment and consider what might help you out. Which is good for most gamers, but will be frustrating for gamers raised on instant gratification.Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the game is that it wasn't QAed thoroughly enough before release. The game had numerous problems with freezing up and stuttering speech, meaning that I had to save frequently to ensure lots of work was not lost. Perhaps it's understandable with a game this complex, but another month of testing and fixing would have been well worth it.

Wrestling fans, your cries have been heard. The wrestling-game gods over at Yukes and THQ have brought you a wrestling game with more tables, ladders, and motorcycle ring entrances than ever before. Unfortunately, they had to leave some important stuff out. Just Bring It is by far the most ambitious and complete wrestling game in history. Over 30 wrestlers can compete in well over 60 match types, ranging from Hardcore to Coffin matches to King of the Ring. If the roster's not large enough for you, you can create your own wrestler with the genre's most complete Create A Superstar mode. The PlayStation 2 really does the game justice. The wrestlers grapple and brawl with smooth realism, but the action sometimes seems stiff. Still, SmackDown's TV-style presentation will knock hardcore fans on their [butts].With all its strengths, the game's faults are tempting to ignore. SmackDown's ringside commentary calls out moves that neither the player nor the superstar even thought of performing, and the music fails, too: Generic rock-type sonic patterns back the action, and the SmackDown theme is the only other song nearby-unless you count "Rolling" by Limp Bizkit. Move timing seems a little off as well, making the simple moves frustrating to pull off. WWF SmackDown: Just Bring It packs in a ton of things that wrestling fans have been screaming about since WWF War Zone, but its weakness lies in the attention to the game, not to the details. Wrestling maniacs will drool ferociously for this title, but non-fans still have no reason to bring it.

After being bored to tears with WWE 12 and WWE 13, I always like to rewind time and play THQ's better offerings. Here's my review-Graphics-The one thing I wasn't too crazy about in this game was the graphics. They're not bad by any means, in fact, the wrestlers move fast and fluid with lots of animation. However, during the entrances is the ugliest part of the game. I realize this game came out in 2001, but wow, the entrances didn't show a &#34;next gen leap&#34; at all. Square heads, flat faces, boxy hands and such rear it's ugly head.That's about as bad as the game looks (cutscenes and entrances), however, once you get into the ring, the game is beautiful. The animation is really good. I particularly was fond of when you pulled off a reversal only to suplex or clothesline an opponent who'd sell a move really good. All of the moves have impact which is missing from the new WWE games. A suplex looks like it really hurts, clotheslines or bodyslams look equally painful. Basically, any move in the game looks fantastic and the wrestlers actually look good in the ring with no slowdown.Sound-There's something I actually like about the annoying commentary found in this game. Michael Cole and Tazz's commentary are really brutal. I wonder why being that past games ike WWF warzone or WWF attitude actually had stellar commentary.The commentary sounds like every phrase is telegraphed in the sense of &#34;Perry...Saturn...is (insert)&#34;. It doesn't sound natural at all.The music is appropriate and I liked some of the theme songs like Dean Malenko's James Bond inspired song.The slams and such sound nice. There's no grunts that I hear and the weapons had dull thuds.Gameplay-First off, the one thing I hate about the control is that it doesn't support analog control. To some this is minor, but I feel a wrestling game should always support analog control.Anyway, the control is about the same as the previous smackdown being that square is reverse, triangle is run, X is to punch or kick and O is to grapple. The other buttons aren't really needed until you find yourself in a match featuring more than 2 wrestlers.I really like how smooth the control scheme is in this game and wish they still used this for modern games. The control is super responsive.The game's roster is the only gripe I had. It features- Perry Saturn, Eddie Guerrero, Dean Malenko, Test, Albert, Dudley Boys, Edge, Kurt Angle, Chris Jericho, Chris Benoit, Triple H, Undertaker, Kane, Big Show, Raven, The Rock, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Rikishi and such.I'm surprised this game didn't feature a better roster being that there were a good amount of wrestlers around then and this was around the invasion angle's beginning. (SDSYM has a better roster)The CAW mode really stinks to be honest. I couldn't even pick a wrestler's theme song and the options are limited.I really don't have much to say bad about the game, but it is a good game featuring a decent roster of wrestlers and some cool perks. Some things worth noting would be that it has an excellent TLC match, you can fight in the crowd...but I felt the wrestlers got up too fast. Even after hitting them with a finisher, they'd get back up.

Intro:Many played the Smackdown!series,Raw series but the two got themselves togheter for Smackdown v.s Raw a while ago.The most recent WWE game Smackdown v.s Raw 2006 surpasses all other wrestling games made up to this point the game is so well made,the graphics,wrestlers and all,it really you get to a WWE match and let you experiment wrestling gaming like never before.Graphics:The graphics are so great every superstars looks like themselves the gaming industry surpasses itself each year at that point.You have a lot of wrestlers from current superstars like Rey Misterio to legends like Hulk Hogan and more aproximatively 50 wrestlers are ainvalable to be played.Each wrestlers have their finishers(up to 2 each).Unlockables:Many things can be unlocked legends,legends belts even shirts.The legends to unlock are Andr? the giant,Hulk hogan(3 ways,80s hogan,hollywood hogan and hulk hogan),British buldog,Jimmy hart,Bret hart,Junkyard dog,Teddibiase,Mankind, Jake the snake.You can also unlock Stone cold and The rock.Also there is screen managers(basicly wallpapers to look at while the loadings)of many superstars.Modes:The season mode is great stories depends of the characters and the league they are Raw or Smackdown.Good season mode some will say its short but its really interresting and an improvement.The new general manager mode is great,you pick a brand between Raw or Smackdown and you manage your superstars`s contracts,the trades,injuries and you organize the matches each week to become manager of the year and beat the other manager.PPV mode were you can play 2005 ppv matchups until tabbo tuesday.Trple threat matches,fatal four way,single ladders,table,hell in a cell,steel cage,iron man,elimination chamber annd much,much more.A lot of matches to choose from and you can easily spend hours just playing matches.Create:You can even decide wich belt you want(when beating the champ as John Cena)the WWE title,or the Cena custom made WWE championship.You can create superstars better than ever more detailed,belts,entrances and more wich is cool.You can create a title and defend it against other Psp owners and the belt value increases and stuff.Minuses:The game only has 2 bad points,the incredibly long loading and sometimes during matches the game freeze for about 2 seconds.The loadind is the big deal of this game cause you have to wait for you entrance to start,the wait for the opponents`s entrance then wait for the match to start and its also long going to menus.The freeze thing aint too bad it stopps the game for 2 seconds maybe.Plusses:Best WWE game ever made in many`s opinion everithing improves each year and this game was no exeption.The graphics are great,the mode are awsome and THIS GAME RULES!Overral:Well nothing more to say this game is amazing and i recommend buying it or at least a rental to every WWE fans and non-fans also.The 2007 edition is going to be better as it was showed on the e3 exposition look for it at the end of the year.
I have only gotten into wrestling within the past 2 years, and it really started out with the game WWF Attitude.  Despite the complex controls I soon mastered it and would whoop any one who dared challenge me.  Later when Smackdown came out I learned a new control style that was even easier to amster and brought a long a better challenge, because any one could master the controls.  Smackdown 2 provide me with the Hell in the Cell match (one of my all time Favs) and Ironman (For a dramatic finish) which I still enjoy.  Now we have Smackdown 3 and it is by far the best wrestling game ever.The graphics for one thing have had a huge boost from the days of before.  No more jagged looking wrestlers here.  Instead the graphics are super smooth and so on.  The music hasn't changed much.  Controls took a huge leap.  More combos now.  And an even deeper counter system (I was whooped on easy by my dad because of the counter system threw my guard off).  I nopw have mastered this system.The only match deleted (Besides the thousands of Special Referee MAtches) was the Casket MAtch, probably the least used (At least by me) and instead we have three new matches, LAst Man Standing, Street Fight, adn Ultimate Submission.  Also the ladder and TLC matches expanded slightly.The biggest change was the story mode.  Although it is incredibly short (4 matches at most) you use this to unlock a huge assortment of hidden things (mostly by defending your title) and thats it.  YOu fight until either the end of Smackdown or until you win a title (Which is eitehr on Raw, Smackdown, or PPV) and from there thats it.The thing I love the most are enterences.  Each are beutifuly crafted adn for once (Literally) you can preview your entrance before deciding.  Also there commentary but it OK at most.Also for fun you can edit wrestlers moves, I only did this once and that was with Big Show, I changed the Alley Oop to the Show Stopper because it's more consistant with the TV events.Over all this is a must buy for wrestling fans and any one looking for an awsome game.

Sure Infamous Second Son is short but I'm expecting some downloadable content soon to spice things up a bit. I loved Infamous 1 and 2 to the point no one will ever replace Cole in my heart.  Cole was THE MAN!  Delsin Rowe would have to be pretty awesome before I would embrace him as the new face of Infamous.  Delsin Rowe is no Cole and I'm happy he never tries to be. Delsin Rowe is his own man.  Cole was pragmatic almost sensible unless you made him mad.  Delsin Rowe is younger and more a wisenhiemer, always ready with the smart*** wise crack.  Tagging every nice spot he see's. Delsin Rowe is a young guy who makes up his mind he is not going to put up with the crap DUP is doing to otherwise good people.Delsin Rowe is smart enough to resist the DUP brain washing news spin cycle that labels everyone with unique conduit powers an instant bio-terrorist.  I love the message in Infamous that says do not be a sheep.  The other totally cool thing in Infamous Second Son is that it lets you choice your moral nature.  I was not always a paragon, I was not always the good guy.  Sometimes I killed a few good guys who got in the way to get the bad guys.  I love how Infamous teaches that despite all our humanity none of us is perfect.  Infamous Second Son gets me viscerally excited often during the game my true darker passions are at play which sort of shows me how much work I have to do in becoming more humane.  Oh yeah I love the story, I love the character its all good.  I upped my rating to reflect new information I was provided.Some reviewers say Infamous Second Son is not funny.  They must not have done any of the Spray Paint mini missions.  The graphic spay can art is funny.  The fact that you must start the artwork is fun.  The fact that the final concept is revealed only after a blackout screen is hilarious.  Delsin Rowe says more than his share of funny things.  Also when Delsin Rowe does the power dive as he becomes the BOMB his grinning I really love this facial expression is priceless. I like that Delsin Rowe is so laid back.  I enjoyed killing all the drug dealers whenever they appeared.  I enjoyed blowing up those DUP sentry towers and their crawer squad vehicles.  The fact that Delsin Rowe's lady friend calls him as he is climbing the "Space Needle" was awesome and funny.People say Infamous Second Son was repetitive well you are fighting an army of occupation.  Occupying armies are not known for their inventitiveness. Ask anyone who has been in the real army.  Armies are about olive drab sameness at the grunt level. Armies of occupation thrive on maintaining the good order using the exact tools seen in the game.  Checkpoints, street level traffic control.  Solders walking around their posts being borded stiff most of the time till you show up to blow their shift with life treatening excitement. All the battles were just right in their difficulty. Oh man this thing has replayability all over it. The graphics were first rate.  The game play mechanics while not perfect were a great improvement over Infamous 1 and 2.  The Delsin Rowe character is more sticky, agile and quick.  The Delsin Rowe  responds better to controller input than any Infamous game ever.  As for frame rate drop or lagging of any kind performance issues I have not seen none.I waited for Second Son patiently for years.  At first Second Son was scheduled to release in December 2013 I brought a PS4 especially to play Second Son.  They pushed the Second Son release out to April and I returned my PS4.  The ONLY reason I brought my PS4 a few days ago was so I could play Infamous Second Son.  Yes I love this Infamous franchise that much. I di dnot expect to really like Delsin Rowe since he was more young and wild than Cole.  To my surprise I ended up loving Delsin Rowe  like a member of the family, he earned his place in my heartfelt respect on his own merit.  I paid full price for Infamous Second Son and I do not feel ill used at all.  Matter of fact Infamous: Second Son is one of the best video purchases I've ever made.  Now all I must do is wait for MASS EFFECT 4 and Borderlands 3 in PS4 format.This Infamous Second Son ROCKS some reviewers think otherwise but, in my honest appraisal I can't find much to hate about this game.  Bring on the Downloadable Content and give me an excuse to play Infamous Second Son again and again!
WWF SmackDown: Just Bring It is an excellent game. ... This is a game for the millenium which truly diserves a five star rating. Now as I write this I have come back from my friend's house playing this for, let me count, about 21 hours (from 7 p.m. Fri. to 8 p.m. Sat.). Even though the roster isn't as expansive as say WWF No Mercy for N64, the quality of the characters surpases everything to its release. Finishing moves really look like how the superstars of the WWF perform them(my personal favorite being the people bounce around the ring after receiving the Stone Cold Stunner). Now I do admit grappling is a slight problem, but generally everything flows. The various matches, including Hell in a cell, I Quit, Table, Ladder, TLC, for example, will keep you playing for hours. One new feature I like is the ability to play a King of the Ring tournament with special matches and not be repetitive(for example you could be in a table match first, then I Quit, then TLC, and so forth). You can even pick weapons from inside the crowd, not just standing at the barrier. The story mode is pretty good, though I don't like having such short title quests. I also like the idea of how you can go to Vince McMahon or Commissioner Regal to ask for matches. Ingenious! Plus, as always, the CAW(create a wrestler) mode is very detailed. My favorite creation we made was Booker Wee. Plus the addition of commentary really spices things up alot. Although it is annoying to hear "that (Move) was performed beautifully" when nobody performed (the move)for miles. The addition of more wrestlers in the ring, 8 at once I believe, really increases the challenge of mastering this game, whereas 4 wrestlers is so easy to learn. If you've never played a SmackDown game in your life, the controls are somewhat hard to learn at first, but eventually you catch on very quickly. All in all, I would say WWF SmackDown: Just Bring It is a great game that will keep die-hard WWF fans laying the smack down for hours on end.

All in all, I would say WWF SmackDown: Just Bring It is a great game that will keep die-hard WWF fans laying the smack down for hours on end.

SOCOM II is one of the best games ever; evident from the first 5 minutes of gameplay. SOCOM II is what all of those other "shooters" and "war-wannabes". This game is so much fun to play. The new levels are so awesome, not to mention realistic. The game is so complicated and fun.The new levels are so much fun to play, and are so imaginative! You can call in airstrikes and also experience the middle east, only 1 word to say about this game and it's new levels...AMAZING.SOCOM II is so realistic, nearly TOO realistic for it's own good...NEARLY. SOCOM II has huge explosions and your enemies are a whole heap smarter than they were in the first one (Another, of the many, ways Sony has improved upon it's self). The graphics of this game are so good, it's really like you're there.The only pitfalls of this game are pretty much optional and obsolite: if you don't own a headset from the first one, you're pretty much out of luck, and if you want to play online, you have to buy a totally different ISP than you would for many other games.And what's with all of these people who are "nit-picking" at this game..."Well you can't save in the middle of a mission"...WHO CARES, it's got to be realistic it's not like the real Seals are can save their missions.Overview:Fun- 20/10, so much fun, so exciting, SO GREAT.Graphics- 20/10 so realistic you'll duck and cover.Gameplay-20/10 Fun, fun fu, a huge improvement on the first one; smarter enemies and more abilties.Difficulty-15/10 It can be EXTREMELY HARD at times.Overall- 75/40This game is AMAZING, there is NO GAME that can ever be compared to SOCOM II. And, for all of you sceptics, SOCOM II BLOWS HALO OUT OF THE WATER, it is that great.This game is a must-buy for ANYONE who is at least MINUTELY interested. It's an awesome addition for all war-buffs and First Person Shooter lovers. BUY THIS GAME, IT'S WORTH EVERY PENNY, I would reccommend this game to anyone if it were $200.In the end you HVE TO BUY THIS GAME.BUY THIS GAME, there's no reason to rent this game before you buy it, I assure you you won't be dissapointed.

Turn-based RPGs of old(like Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Golden Sun) are hard to find in this day and time. Most are taking the action RPG route or some mixture of that & another type of game. So, it's really nice to see XSEED produce a game for us fans of the older Turn-based RPGs. Based upon the manga & anime, Brave Story, the story begins with a young man named Tatsuya and his friend named Miki sitting on a bench. Tatsuya is sitting there playing his PSP, for awhile, when he notices that Miki is missing. Kratos, her dog, barks and shows Tatsuya where Miki is. Finding her unconscious on the ground, Tatsuya sees she is sick from some unknown illness. He wishes that she becomes better when a voice speaks to him. It asks him if he wants to save her and make her healthy once again. He accepts and is whisked away to a land he doesn't know to save his friend. That's where the story begins. Although Tatsuya & Miki were created specifically for the game, many of the cast from the Brave Story manga are in the game. I'll admit, the game is typical old school Turn-based RPG fare but it's a solid game with some of the most breathtaking visuals that I've ever seen on the Playstation Portable. At the present time, you couldn't find a better RPG to waste your time away on.
Love this game so I had to get it for my psp. Game game in the seal with no damage to the case or disk.
this is a game you must get, and own. the game is funn and sometimes it gets difficult, and so what who cares. its fun, and you must get it and play it over and over.  especially when the second one that comes out today June 7 2011. im getting it,a nd i will beat it as i did. the game has great graphics, and an excelent story.

Downhill mountain biking is relentlessly fast, extremely dangerous, and not for the faint of heart. Same goes for Downhill Domination, which delivers more frantic speed thrills than most extreme games. It's neither inaccurate nor an insult to call Downhill Domination "SSX on dirt." Not only do players choose one of 14 characters and careen down 27 enormous international mountains while busting tricks, smacking opponents, and collecting power-ups, but the controls are nearly identical, too. All stunts are performed with the shoulder buttons plus Triangle as a modifier (and it's not always comfortable). As you earn cash, you'll upgrade your bike and unlock goodies. Downhill Domination features an incredible sensation of speed and a canted camera that will make you leave your stomach at the top of the mountain. Narrow trails, treacherous terrain, and the fast gameplay really ratchet up the tension-it's hard to keep up, and you almost forget to do tricks in the mad scramble to stay upright. Avoiding polar bears, mountain goats, hikers, vehicles, and maybe even a sasquatch or two is all part of the frantic fun. Less enjoyable is the amazingly blatant product placement-bike brands like Trek and Specialized make sense, but while you pedal, billboards for online auction sites and energy bars peddle under the guise of earnable sponsorships. Gamers will tire of it quickly, along with the repetitive voice quips and lackluster music-whee, rap about bicycles! Action-sports junkies should at least rent Downhill Domination to experience its admirably difficulty and teeth-rattling sense of chaos. It's not for the weak.

It is virtually impossible to discuss Downhill Domination without making numerous references to the SSX series (from EA Sports Big), so there is no point trying to avoid such references in a review.  Plus, it is quite likely that a player of Downhill Domination will have at least moderate familiarity with the SSX series.Downhill Domination is the latest entry into the extreme sports genre popularized by SSX.  SSX and its sequel SSX tricky focus on snowboarding, featuring over-the-top stunts and extremely personable characters, along with combat and numerous gameplay modes/challenges.  Downhill Demolition is the same, except that it focuses on mountain bike racing.Like the SSX series, Downhill Domination features several &quot;initial&quot; characters, plus others which must be unlocked.  In the SSX series, more characters become available based upon total number of wins (with all unlocked characters); in Downhill Domination, however, bonus characters are unlocked by defeating various gameplay modes/challenges.  Further, Downhill Domination includes several mountain biking celebrities as bonus characters.In terms of characters, however, the SSX series (and SSX Tricky in particular) does a far better job of giving each character a personality.  To some extent, the characters in Downhill Domination are essentially &quot;the same.&quot;  This is in part due to only-mediocre voice-acting, and in even greater part to the rather scant &quot;phrasebook&quot; allotted per character; this last point is particularly noticeable in longer events (such as Technical Downhill races) as the player's chosen character keeps saying the same catchphrase over and over and over and over and over and...Like the SSX series, Downhill Domination has a great array of courses available.  Courses are located on mountains in Italy, USA (three areas), Peru, Russia, Scotland, Japan, and Canada; each mountain is extremely different from the others, although the courses on each mountain are relatively similar.  With the exception of Mountaincross courses, all the courses are extremely vast, with numerous alternate paths to be taken; Mountaincross courses are rather &quot;linear,&quot; with alternate paths a rare find.There is definitely plenty of action in Downhill Domination.  With precious few exceptions, there is NO time for the player to &quot;rest&quot; on a course; obstacles and tight corners are seemingly everywhere.  When in a pack with the other competitors, there is also a great tendency for opponents to fight the player (literally) during the descent, so the player must be wary of others at all times.  Further, many of the obstacles on the courses are MOVING: spectators, animals, rockslides, and even vehicles can easily slow the player's character or cause a massive bone-breaking collision.Extras abound in Downhill Domination.  Some extras (such as new courses, bonus characters, and character-specific videos) are unlocked by continually winning.  Others, however, can be purchased in the Bike Shop.  Some of these extras provide cool visual effects, while others provide a means to customize the gaming experience to some extent.  Some bonus levels can be purchased, such as the Moshbowl.  Non-character videos can also be purchased, and better bikes can be purchased as well.  However, the player should not expect to simply win a handful of races and be able to acquire the best buyable extras in the game; A LOT of time and numerous races are required to obtain the best extras.One area where Downhill Domination truly stands out, however, is the game manual.  Rarely is a game manual as informative about the tiny details of the game!!!  Tips are scattered throughout the manual, which also details exactly how to unlock (or how much it will cost to purchase) every possible extra in the game.  Representative screenshots and excellent artwork fill virtually every page.  Finally, the back cover of the game manual lists half of the sixty-four tricks available in the game, providing the player with a handy quick-reference guide which is extremely useful when participating in the Freestyle Career; this same information is located within the game manual as well.Without a doubt, Downhill Domination is among the top games released in 2003.  In the extreme sports genre, only the SSX series (SSX Tricky in particular) is superior - and even that is solely due to the personalization of the characters.  This will definitely grab and keep a player's attention, and certainly raises the bar for the extreme sports genre.Now, EA Sports Big must answer the challenge.

But don't listen to them there kids that probley got upset becuase there parents whouldn't let them get the game. Anyway Jak X is about when jak and the crew are invited to drink a spcial drink that Krew wanted them to drink. But, it was posin and now the only way to get rit of it is to play in the sport called combat race. The raceing is just plan awsome every secound there's blowing up, crashing, and smashing. In this game you can't play nice it's ethier win or lose. There are many great weapons in the game also. You gotta get this game it rocks.

I rented this game also for a week! And let me tell you something, it rocks! this game is the best. It wipes the ssx snowboarding games off the cliff and into the ice. i actually thought that this game will not be as realistic as watching it on tv or playing the actual sport, but as soon as i played it, i enjoyed it better than the ssx game. And besides, the ssx game is not realistic at all. But this one is the most realistic of all time! i actually recommend buyers to collect easports games and the espn games aswell, so you guys can have a huge mixed up sports games collection. Any ways, if you readers are sure that you enjoy this wonderful game, then buy it. To prove to you it rocks, see all pictures on the screenshot section and make sure that you don't just like the game because of the graphics but because of the thrill of realisms.

Note: This review is ONLY about the &quot;Scars of Velious&quot; add-on to Everquest, and not the game itself.&quot;Scars of Velious&quot; (referred to as SoV or simply &quot;Velious&quot;) is an Everquest expansion for levels 27-65. Unlike other expansions, it does not introduce a new race, a new class, raise the level cap or introduce a lot of special new abilities (although it does introduce a few for melees). Instead, its focus was on content.Specifically, it covers the frozen lost continent of Velious, home to a race of shipwrecked dwarves from Faydwer (in the original Everquest), trying to survive when faced by hostile giants and ancient dragons. The struggle between these three forces defines the expansion -- if you spend more than an hour here, you're more or less forced to choose sides, and who you fight determines how the other sides view you, which in turn closes off some content and opens up other content, as you become part of the battle for the future of this continent.The epitome of this struggle are two parallel quests for melees and spellcasters given out by the Coldain dwarves. Each is a multistage quest, and involves you proving your loyalty to the Coldain in their war against the giants. At first, the tasks they assign you are mundane -- deliver this axe to be sharpened, keep my nephew the &quot;great hunter&quot; out of trouble, go deliver some food to the captain of the guard -- but they culminate in skirmishes and even a full fledged war that totally redoes one zone for several hours in a pitched battle (lead by the players) between the giants and dwarves.Even for players not interested in this content (the ring war in the Great Divide is a high level raid), the expansion offers the best dungeons in EverQuest, amazing new cities, two new planes, high level spells, and a greater concentration of dragons than any other expansion in the game.While much of EverQuest can, at times, feel like a fantasy version of Quake, Velious lives up to the promise of an online roleplaying game that immerses players in another place and time. Featuring landscapes so chilly, you find yourself putting on a sweater, terrifying enemies, and great acts of heroism, &quot;Scars of Velious&quot; is the peak of the EverQuest experience.This expansion receives my strongest possible recommendation to all EverQuest players with characters level 27 and up.

Well after I gave poor reviews to Everquest, Everquest II I am giving high reviews to! My hat goes off to sony for making an amazing game. Everquest II is the paragon of fantasy games. Almost all my quibbles I had about Everquest are fixed with Everquest II. I played Everquest for a while and got bored and fustrated that the fun didn't really begin until I became a higher level character. Also solo play and death in Everquest was not fun. It seemed unsurmountable to solo a character past level 20. Well sony listened to players carping criticism and made a better game with Everquest II.Improvements:1) The death system is more congenial in everquest II. You don't loose your body, you don't loose experience, levels, the only attribute that is affected in death is wisdom, you can still equip all your items after death.2) In my opinion graphics transcend any game to date including Doom 3! Surreal graphics, character detail is immaculate, lighting and reflection affects are resplendent. This game is a pearl! My paladin's pulchritude left me stunned. Those incredulous graphics come at a cost though, it requires a goliath of a system to play this game well. My desktop is rigged with a 3ghz processor, 768 megabytes of ram, a 10,000 rpm hard disk - RAID configured, and a Geforce 6600 GT with 128 megs of VRAM and my computer is still not effacacious enough for this game. The ultra high graphic settings in Everquest II can freeze my computer with ease. So I can only image how eye-popping this game can be! The game recommends to play the game at ultra high (maxed out) video system you should have a video card with 512 megabytes of VRAM, YIKES !!! For now I can only play it at a resolution of 1024 x 1280 pixels on a High Quality setting.3) No kill/loot stealing ! This is a treasure trove. I wallow this in everquest II once you attack a monster that monster is locked with you. A little lock appears at the top indicating to other players that kill is all yours and other players cannot barge in and kill the monster ( steal your kill and your experience and loot from that monster). This was an unsurmountable problem in Everquest that vexed me as a player, because some players  were inconsiderate and plundered my experience points and spoils! This is probally one of the biggest reasons why I prefer this game over World of Warcraft, in World of Wacraft no such system like this is in place other players can pillage your earned loot without reprimand. I speak from my own personal experience.4) I wallow in the monolithic labyrinth of timorous passageways and chambers found in the dungeons in Everquest II !! What an improvement the dungeons are from it's predecessor. The dungeons were not all that arousing to me in Everquest, except for mistmore and kurnst. And what is nice about it is a wide range of characters from many different levels can savor these dungeons. I fell in love with Stromhold ! Given my druthers, this is my favorite dungeon. I can still gain experience from this dungeon even at level 27.  The level range of the monsters in this dungeon are from 15 - 25. I have seen characters as low as level 13 and as high as level 30 adventuring through this dungeon. This is a dungeon you can revist over and over again as you level up and pioneer into unfathomable depths. This dungeon doesn't look like a hundred other dungeons, it is a novelty and has its own look. Graphically one of the most jaw dropping zones.5) Even green players can venture through entrancing dungeons and caves. This wasn't true with everquest before the expansions. The origonal everquest was unfriendly to new players, it was only until later after the expansions that they added oddments of new zones and features for the inexperienced characters. YOu can participate in a raid at only level 23 in this game ! In everquest Raids were origonally only reseved for high level characters.6) Equiptment and spells were basic and only a small farrago of items to choose from. The crafting system in Everquest was elemtary and crude. Everquest II is a stark contrast, a conglomeration of hundreds of arms and incantations to pick from. An motley of mythical, legendary, fabled and treasured loot.  Crafting is unparralled in Evequest II. Players can become apt in their chosen craft in little time. Better crafting systems create a more robust economy. The economy in this sequel is so volatile it is surreal ! Spells can be upgraded from other players that specialize in scribing scrolls. All my items I wear are handcrafted by other players. There is just something special about being able to wear items other players tailored specifically for your needs !7) Solo adventuring is actually an option in this sequel. Cresting to that elusive level 60 can be concievably be done alone in this game without any other players help. I enjoyed the fast clip I could level up while playing solo in this game, this was a pampering change compared to its predecessor. This sate my appetite for an online game that had an oustanding single player experience. Leveling up is a lot faster in EQ II also because you never loose experience or levels ! You don't have to worry about recovering a body in order to level up, example in everquest whenever I died I couldn't kill anything or level at all period because all my stuff was gone left on my body somewhere !8) The principal cities in Everquest II, Queynos and Freeport, sate my fantasy reveries. Queynos I found a serene solace where my character would retreat to ease the days tensions. The king arthur atmosphere of the city made me feel as if I was repute and wore a laurel over my head. I had a profound feeling of chivalry and swagger.  Freeport was a becon for vile irreverence and servitude. NPC's were contempt and shallow in this city. The city's sky was marred by the gloom of the precipice turrets and pallisades.cons:1) I think the general opinion that the party system is flawed in Everquest II is a cogent argument. Although I am sure Sony carefully crafted the new party system, anyone who has played the game can't deny the inherent shortcomings. The party system in other games ,like for example World of Warcraft, does not bludgeon the players when they make a fatal mistake. I do not like groups sharing experience debt. This can make playing in groups an irremediable calamity. Players do not like losing expeirence and if I was the cause most players wouldn't hesitate to chafe me with a pompous lecture. Other players would get infuriated and berate me if I died, one group booted me out of the group when I died. I quickly learned some players are pious and haughty about this game. This game overall is quant and pleasing even with its flaws.
Well after I gave poor reviews to Everquest, Everquest II I am giving high reviews to! My hat goes off to sony for making an amazing game. Everquest II is the paragon of fantasy games. Almost all my quibbles I had about Everquest are fixed with Everquest II. I played Everquest for a while and got bored and fustrated that the fun didn't really begin until I became a higher level character. Also solo play and death in Everquest was not fun. It seemed unsurmountable to solo a character past level 20. Well sony listened to players carping criticism and made a better game with Everquest II.Improvements:1) The death system is more congenial in everquest II. You don't loose your body, you don't loose experience, levels, the only attribute that is affected in death is wisdom, you can still equip all your items after death.2) In my opinion graphics transcend any game to date including Doom 3! Surreal graphics, character detail is immaculate, lighting and reflection affects are resplendent. This game is a pearl! My paladin's pulchritude left me stunned. Those incredulous graphics come at a cost though, it requires a goliath of a system to play this game well. My desktop is rigged with a 3ghz processor, 768 megabytes of ram, a 10,000 rpm hard disk - RAID configured, and a Geforce 6600 GT with 128 megs of VRAM and my computer is still not effacacious enough for this game. The ultra high graphic settings in Everquest II can freeze my computer with ease. So I can only image how eye-popping this game can be! The game recommends to play the game at ultra high (maxed out) video system you should have a video card with 512 megabytes of VRAM, YIKES !!! For now I can only play it at a resolution of 1024 x 1280 pixels on a High Quality setting.3) No kill/loot stealing ! This is a treasure trove. I wallow this in everquest II once you attack a monster that monster is locked with you. A little lock appears at the top indicating to other players that kill is all yours and other players cannot barge in and kill the monster ( steal your kill and your experience and loot from that monster). This was an unsurmountable problem in Everquest that vexed me as a player, because some players  were inconsiderate and plundered my experience points and spoils! This is probally one of the biggest reasons why I prefer this game over World of Warcraft, in World of Wacraft no such system like this is in place other players can pillage your earned loot without reprimand. I speak from my own personal experience.4) I wallow in the monolithic labyrinth of timorous passageways and chambers found in the dungeons in Everquest II !! What an improvement the dungeons are from it's predecessor. The dungeons were not all that arousing to me in Everquest, except for mistmore and kurnst. And what is nice about it is a wide range of characters from many different levels can savor these dungeons. I fell in love with Stromhold ! Given my druthers, this is my favorite dungeon. I can still gain experience from this dungeon even at level 27.  The level range of the monsters in this dungeon are from 15 - 25. I have seen characters as low as level 13 and as high as level 30 adventuring through this dungeon. This is a dungeon you can revist over and over again as you level up and pioneer into unfathomable depths. This dungeon doesn't look like a hundred other dungeons, it is a novelty and has its own look.

Note: This review is ONLY about the &quot;Planes of Power&quot; add-on to Everquest, and not the game itself.In many ways, &quot;Planes of Power&quot; (PoP) is one of the best of the Everquest expansions, raising the level limit, bringing in more planes (extradimensional homes of the gods) than in the rest of the game, spectacular new enemies to fight and a single overarching storyline that spans 19 levels and puts the most powerful characters in a battle against the forces of creation, freeing Norrath's equivalent of Prometheus, the god who gave magic to mortals and who was imprisoned by the others for his crime in a place no one would ever be able to find him ...This all sounds pretty good, but for an expansion not designed to be the finale for the most successful American MMORPG, it has painted the rest of the game into something of a corner.For starters, where does the game go once players have gotten more power than other (enough that some players are now soloing dragons that normally up to 30 people to kill) and have defeated almost all of the gods? Fighting a really, really, REALLY tough orc who happens to be as tough as the God of War strains credulity -- more than that, it's just plain silly.Secondly, the expansion also includes the Plane of Knowledge, a plane every level 1 character can reach by clicking on the bookstand outside starting cities. And because all such cities are included (along with a few other locations in Kunark, Velious and Luclin), travel distances in the game are all but a memory. Instead of evil characters having to suffer the consequences of their evil, all characters may now use the factionless Plane of Knowledge as a home base without consequences, and may skip past barriers to go anywhere they want, almost at will. While this is inarguably a convenience, part of the appeal of Everquest was its wealth of content. PoP turns EQ into a Readers Digest version of Norrath, with players able to skip between the highlights, and now any zone more than two zonelines away from Knowledge is a back water where many players simply will not go. The game has been forever changed, and this is one genie unlikely to ever be put back in the bottle.As for the content itself, it's good. It uses existing lore, draws us into the ongoing story of the game, and the planes are often real eye-poppers (the Plane of Innovation, with its magical clockwork robots run amok and the fleshscape of the Plane of Disease are two of the show-stoppers).None of it other than Knowledge can be accessed by characters under level 46, and the other planes require further levels, characters to succeed in certain quests, characters to have beaten certain raid bosses (in events involving dozens of other characters) or all of the above. The vast majority of the player base will never see at least six of the zones in PoP. While most of the previous expansions had zones similar to this, they were usually a mere one or two per expansion (Veeshan's Peak in Kunark, Sleeper's Tomb and the Plane of Mischief in Velious, Vex Thal in Luclin), and six zones are an awful lot of content for players to pay for and never use -- essentially subsidizing the content for the most powerful guilds.For what it is, PoP is enjoyable, and a lot of fun. But much of it feels like well-meant mistakes. Game balance is changed forever, much of the older content is sinking into obscurity, and Everquest's great system of faction that made player characters part of a world where actions matter is more or less irrelevant now.&quot;Everquest: Planes of Power&quot; is a lot of fun (especially if you enjoy raiding), but it's hard to see how the game can continue on much longer in any recognizable form after this.Recommended for the great deal of utility Everquest players will get from the expansion, especially players with characters level 46+.

I'm not sure what I expected to get out of &quot;EverQuest,&quot; having heard some opinions from people who are much more hardcore gamers than I am, but here's what I got out of it:&quot;EverQuest&quot; is not a regular computer game. You don't pop it into your computer, go whack a certain number monsters on the head, win, and then deinstall it. Those games are a lot of fun, but once you've, say, killed Diablo several times with different character types in &quot;Diablo II,&quot; you're not exactly rushing to do it the 300th time. Not by any means. (Great game, &quot;Diablo II,&quot; but a different sort of animal altogether.) Those that see &quot;EverQuest&quot; as a big online &quot;Quake&quot; game seem to get very frustrated with many aspects of the game, including other players, and the feeling is usually mutual.That's because, instead of &quot;Diablo,&quot; &quot;EverQuest&quot; is more akin to a huge themed chat room interwoven with a game. Sure, you can and do play by yourself sometime, but you have to hunt far and wide across the game world of Norrath to find a place where you won't be interacting with someone else. (For the record, you can find it: Go to the Tox Forest south of Erudin, and swim west from the docks. The Kerra Isle zone is almost always empty, and it's especially so inside, if you choose not to hunt the native cat people, but instead do the quests for them. The quiet is a nice change from the sometimes deafening roar that pervades most EQ zones.)In fact, the game is designed to more or less force you to work with other players: After getting your character (selected from either sex, multiple fantasy races and about as many fantasy hero/villain careers) up a few levels whacking the more mundane monsters and animals, you pretty quickly run into a wall where it becomes much harder to go at it alone. Jack may have been a giant-killer in the fairy tale, but if you want to kill giants in EQ, you're going to need friends. And that's what makes EQ a killer app: Interaction. You may think you aren't interested in making a bunch of online friends, but you'll soon find yourself laughing with, cursing with and adventuring with strangers from around the globe. I have no idea who some of the people I play with are beyond the vaguest details, but it doesn't matter. I get to jump into this fantasy world and I've got brave friends who have my back as I have theirs, ready and waiting.Hardcore gamers, as I alluded to earlier, will quibble about some of EQ's technical specifications. First off, I've had very few technical problems. I can almost always connect within 30 seconds, have been kicked off line only twice in over six weeks of play, and the dreaded &quot;lag&quot; where the game continues by the connection between server and home computer can't keep up, has rarely been a problem. It occurs, but it's not very problematic, and even the harshest EQ critics acknowledge that it's getting better all the time.There's also some talk that the graphics, especially in the original section of EQ (the continents of Antonica and Faydwer, and the island of Odus) aren't up to par, but I don't get the argument. Setting the game at maximum resolution (because I've got a late model computer), the graphics are gorgeous, and I haven't even explored the prettier (and more graphics-intensive) continent of Kunark yet.For fantasy fans, EQ strikes a good balance between the familiar and the new. Many players want to play traditional elves and dwarves, and those areas of Faydwer are packed to the gills (particularly the elvish areas of the Faydark forest). You can help a sickly unicorn, slay dragons, play as a hobbit-like halfling and battle fierce orcs. Or, if you need another Tolkein-inspired fantasy game like you need a hole in the head, you can be an Erudite magician from far-off Odus (EQ has included a fantasy race of color, the Erudites, with a lightly African-themed look to them, and has made them the preeminent masters of all sorts of magic, good and evil, in the world of Norrath), exploring the deadly continent of Kunark and battling the native lizard peoples, the Iksar, there. (The Iksar are also a playable race, for those looking for an extremely distinctive character type.)There's more to this game than can be covered in this review -- characters can develop skills beyond the ability to kill each other; my gnome wizard is an accomplished linguist, for instance, meaning that I've had to sit down with more than a dozen player-controlled characters of non-gnomish descent and share language lessons -- as EQ is a rich, deep, surprisingly immersive game.Everything they say is true: EQ is addictive. And there's lots of good reasons why. A terrific game, and my household has two copies, one for me, and one for my wife.

First off this game is Not like the PC version as it takes place some 500 years before the PC version. the graphics are good for a MMORPG and there is a wide viriety of characters to craete. There are plety of servers and for each servers, one can make up to seven charaters. there are Barbarians, Elves, Dark elves, Dwarves, trolls, Haflings, all which can be Enchanters, CLerics, Warriors, Shadow KNights and many many more combinations. with that many combinations there is definately something for new players and Veteran MMORPGs alike. this is an excellent game and i would recomend it to anyone that likes RPGs of all kind.

(Warning to all Parents and Squeamish Game Players: Grand Theft Auto 3 contains EXTREMELY profane, sexual, violent, indecent, gory, and immensely amoral subjects.Be Warned Grand Theft Auto 3 SHOULD NOT BE PLAYED by ANYONE UNDER THE AGE OF 18 or by Anybody easily offended by anything morally controversial. You've Been Warned!!)Let's begin by saying DMA Designs and Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto 3 is irrefutably the most maturated video game ever released on a video game console as of yet. In this markedly distressing nevertheless infinitely engaging tale of self-serving criminal vengeance, irresistibly intoxicating mayhem, comically tinted mass violence, astoundingly appealing depravity, and colorfully frank sexuality, you play an ex-con delinquent, living in the criminally afflicted and militantly run metropolis of Liberty City, who has recently has been betrayed by his former girlfriend in a high-profile bank robbery. After being found unanimously guilty by a jury, this incarcerated hoodlum becomes inadvertently liberated by a gruesome surprise jailbreak, spectacularly near identical to that of a modern film, which leaves our &quot;hero&quot; absolute free reign to sow his primal oats in typical Grand Theft Auto fashion.Utterly free to unconditionally do anything his little thieving heart desires, your character has the exceptional versatility to solicit for immeasurably titillating criminal assignments from a vast array of mob bosses to progress further up the illegal ladder of success, steal infinite numbers of cars, trucks, and emergency vehicles (70 vehicles in all including: police cars, S.W.A.T. Trucks, Emergency Medical Vehicles (EMS), Fire Trucks, F.B.I. cars, and Military Tanks) for all his practical immoral needs, purchase and discover all types of wholesome tools of mass destruction and serial homicide including: pistols, Uzi's, M-16's, Flamethrowers, remote-control cars, Grenades, Molotov Cocktails, Sniper Rifles, and the inestimably gratifying baseball bat, mug to your hearts content, play an implausible number of mini-games (Taxi missions, Fire-fighter missions, Police Vigilante missions, Ambulance missions), and even call out for prostitutes. This game embarks upon an exclusively innovative and ingeniously diversified pinnacle of video game interactive-ness and adaptability that will virtually stupefy all who play it and absorb it's players into the refreshing exuberance of it's fiendishly addictive gameplay and massively varied options.In this expansive grandly phenomenal visual 3D conversion from GTA's generally graphically lackluster 2D origins, Grand Theft Auto 3 also currently represents the unquestionably finest polygonal work yet seen on the Playstation 2 console (until most likely Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty). Besides it's explicitly lifelike characters, superbly authentic looking automobiles, and thoroughly impressive frame-rate, GTA3's sound system in particular is liberally fantastic for it's exceptionally vast radio selections. Like it's previous incarnations, GTA3 has a radio system where you can listen to music in about every vehicle in the game. However, GTA3 amplifies this option by allowing you to choose between seven or so different radio stations each with it's own particular musical genre, commercial advertisements, and a viable host. Choosing among Classical, Reggae, Talk Radio (My Favorite), Pop, Techno, and others, GTA3's radio archives (about 5 hours worth) contributes incalculably to the game's hugely expansive appeal in even more unforeseen ways.Grand Theft Auto 3 is an extraordinarily magnificent cinematic video gaming experience that despite it's ethically controversial content symbolizes everything categorically glorious and superlatively outstanding about the video game forum.Not to be missed for ALL the tea in China. A Must-Buy for any fan of Adult Gaming.

Trucks, Emergency Medical Vehicles (EMS), Fire Trucks, F.B.I. cars, and Military Tanks) for all his practical immoral needs, purchase and discover all types of wholesome tools of mass destruction and serial homicide including: pistols, Uzi's, M-16's, Flamethrowers, remote-control cars, Grenades, Molotov Cocktails, Sniper Rifles, and the inestimably gratifying baseball bat, mug to your hearts content, play an implausible number of mini-games (Taxi missions, Fire-fighter missions, Police Vigilante missions, Ambulance missions), and even call out for prostitutes. This game embarks upon an exclusively innovative and ingeniously diversified pinnacle of video game interactive-ness and adaptability that will virtually stupefy all who play it and absorb it's players into the refreshing exuberance of it's fiendishly addictive gameplay and massively varied options.In this expansive grandly phenomenal visual 3D conversion from GTA's generally graphically lackluster 2D origins, Grand Theft Auto 3 also currently represents the unquestionably finest polygonal work yet seen on the Playstation 2 console (until most likely Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty). Besides it's explicitly lifelike characters, superbly authentic looking automobiles, and thoroughly impressive frame-rate, GTA3's sound system in particular is liberally fantastic for it's exceptionally vast radio selections. Like it's previous incarnations, GTA3 has a radio system where you can listen to music in about every vehicle in the game. However, GTA3 amplifies this option by allowing you to choose between seven or so different radio stations each with it's own particular musical genre, commercial advertisements, and a viable host. Choosing among Classical, Reggae, Talk Radio (My Favorite), Pop, Techno, and others, GTA3's radio archives (about 5 hours worth) contributes incalculably to the game's hugely expansive appeal in even more unforeseen ways.Grand Theft Auto 3 is an extraordinarily magnificent cinematic video gaming experience that despite it's ethically controversial content symbolizes everything categorically glorious and superlatively outstanding about the video game forum.Not to be missed for ALL the tea in China. A Must-Buy for any fan of Adult Gaming.

Sex, drugs, rock and roll and just plain fun, GTA 3 is not for kids.  You cruise around Liberty City with stolen cars, picking up chicks, and doing jobs for the mob and mafia.A unique feature in GTA 3 is that you can listen to the radio while driving around.  There's about six different stations.  Chatterbox is one of my favorite stations, it never gets old.  The stations do repeat and can be annoying at times.  You could have the radio off.You are an escaped convict looking for work.  But, it's not good honest work....but you could do that if you wanted to.  You get money from doing stunts or completing a mission.  The missions get harder as you go.  These are just some of the missions you do:Pick up a girl Named Misty from the HospitalBe a driver in a getaway car (or van) filled with bank robbersKilling a guy with a bat, and steal his car and get it a new paint job.And so on.  This game is NOT for anyone under 17. It's rated Mature for a good reason.

I'm the type of guy who likes movies with unhappy endings, and stories where the bad guy wins. GTA3 offers you a chance to be the bad guy in a world of bad guys, and get rich doing it. From double-crossing mob kingpins to cutthroat real media moguls to renegade corrupt cops on the take, you'll find yourself a mercenary to all the high-priced scum of the earth, doing the anti-hero dirty work that you know you love. You'll go from stealing sports cars for the Yakuza, to assassinating mob members (while of course avoiding the obligatory shotgun blasts and sub-machine gun fire) to rocket-launcher blasting an airplane loaded with kilos of coke from the Columbian Cartel. And that's not even mentioning the fun you'll have avoiding the National Guard's tanks.But of course, it's not all bad news. You can steal a cop car and play vigilante, murdering the thieves that wish they were you, racking up police bribes for your handiwork. You can steal a fire truck and while you're putting out fires (to get the eventual FLAMETHROWER... mmmmmm) you can listen to the delightful crunch of pedestrians beneath your wheels. Or you can skip all that and just blow everything in sight to kingdom come. Even when all of the invariably fun and challenging (Try shooting your way through the Columbian stronghold or evading the FBI and National Guard all the way across town) missions are over, the game still has ridiculous replay value with it's wealth of secrets, weapons, hidden packages, off-road missions and rampant mayhem. The world is a hellhole, and you're dropped right in the middle of it, machine gun and all.The graphics are crisp and clean, the characters' faces and bodies are infinite in variety, and the environments consist of three sprawling and beautifully detailed islands each with unique impressive landscapes and "personality." Every visual effect is the best there is -- nothing screams realism like the blood splatters around a bat-pummeled drug dealers crushed skull. The sounds of gunfire ring through the air with the fluidity of a symphony of destruction that would make Dave Mustaine cream his shorts. Elevated trains rumble overhead while wailing police sirens have you constantly muttering "Is that the game, or is it outside?" Pedestrians speak to you as you pass by, right before you blast them a new orifice. Car radios offer a selection of diverse styles of music (though the talk radio station Chatterbox tends to be the most fun to listen to) to go with the sounds of the wanton destruction outside of the car's doors. There are dozens of vehicles to steal, hundreds of people and places to be amazed by, and countless ways to enjoy this game that you wish would never end. The missions are plentiful and varied, with from low-level gang-bangers needing personal favors (like retrieving their stolen porno magazines from a rival speeding away in a van -- I love that mission) to rich entrepreneurs ordering the assassination of powerful crime leaders. The violence and the depravity never stops, and it never felt so good. Don't listen to what authority figures tell you; Crime does pay, and this game pays off, big-time. Easily the best game I've ever played for any system, anytime.Oh, and did I mention you can recharge your health by picking up hookers?

Arrived quickly, in fairly good shape. Only complaint is that I had to peel some stickers off, which left a little sticky residue, but that's pretty minor.

This game really is THE premier game for thePS2. It leads all fields in gameplay, graphics and most of all, fun.Alright, First of all this game is just an all out frag-fest. And it's one of the better ones at that. Ofcourse as any educated buyer, you already know the story, but I'll tell you a little about the game it's self. All throughout the game I noticed striking similarities between killzone and Wars that had happened before. For instance, there's a hefty dose of Trench warfare that can be considered a rehash of WWI. Also there's gritty urban combat, which can be seen as WWII. and then there's soe Jungle warfare, which could be taken as a juiced up futuristic version of the Vietnam War. It's actually really cool. Knd of lick a campaign of the Wars America's fought in.The Graphics Are great. The whole game looks like film footage from a war. There is a grainy overlay that makes everything hazy and there is a sort of dinginess about the game. Also all of the environments are detailed and bring out the best that the PS2 has to offer; from brightly lit rooms to debris ridden subway tunnels, this game's graphics brings even the all-mighty X-BOX to it's knees. Explosions look amazing, and a thick smoke hangs over the blast area for some time after the blast, making for some frantic moments of blind shooting. Killzone has some of the best particle effects I've ever seen, meaning that every bullet hits and couses a plume of smoke, blood or bits of concrete to be thrown up into the air. It's great to see bullets fly towards you and hit a patch of ground in front of you, sending dirt into your face, that makes for some frantic moments of scrambling for any cover you can find. Also the Weapons look amazing. From the M86 silenced weapon Lugar carries around, to Templar's M84, the weapon designs and graphics really are a sight to behold. The scopes reflect in certain lights and the guns are so well rendered they actually look real. This comes in handy when you see the enemies' menacing, glowing eyes, in a dark and damp boiler room or a steemy jungle, because you feel like you have to right tools for the job.Which brings me to my next point, all of the character layouts are great. The Helghast (Your enemy) is a hulking menace, that dons an oxygen mask and has glowing orange goggles. They really do scare you when you first incounter them; Which in turn makes it that much more fulfilling to pump one of the bug-eyed suckers full of lead.Also, when these guys drop, they fall hard, their bodies twisting and contorting, which really does add to the realism. Also, bodies are thrown in the opposite direction of a grenade blast or rocket explosion, causeing their riddled corpses to slump over metal railings or Slam into a concrete wall and be thrown to the ground. It really is cool to see the helghast bodies litter a room, it's strangly exciting to see what will happen to a helghast trooper if you throw that grenade by them, or hit them in the stomach with a high-powered shotgun slug. The Character models and brilliant physics make this game a real treat for the eye. Also, a welcomed innovation is that an enemy soldier's body will lay in the same location throughout your romp through the game, they don't dissapear like they do in countless other games. To me, there is no greater joy in this game, then to walk around the room and admire the work you've preformed on 20-30 Helghan bodies.The sound effects in this game really set it apart. From Grenade explosions to the crackle of gunfire, everything sounds realistic, adding to the thrill of "opening up" on a Helghast platoon. My only gripe would be that the Helghast troops repeat some of the same phrases over and over. So frequently, in-fact, that it is not uncommon to hear the same phrase screamed more than once. But still, it does add to the realism of the game, because in those frantic moments when you're surrounded by Helghast, it doesn't matter what they're screaming, it's still frightining.The gameplay of this game is superb. From the function of weapons to the enemy AI, this game is top notch. The enemies will engage, take cover and throw grenades when appropriate, making even the most comon troops a challenge to take out. The Helghast will work together and give covering fire for their pinned down comrades, they'll ambush you in a hot, sticky jungle, they'll do pretty much anything that a normal person would do, which really does make them a worthy adversary. The controls are easy to learn and make the game fun to play. The addition of a 3 button engage button is smart. Meaning that you tap L1 to throw a grenade, spit out a hail of bullets with R1 and then use your secondary weapon with R2, it's a brilliant scheme that allows you to always be in the middle of the action, and allows quick access to every weapon in your arsenal.Of course, you can only carry 3 weapons at a time, so deciding when to get rid of that Hish-Magnification Sniper rifle in exchange for the No Magnification M42 Machine gun can be a challenge in itself, The whole game has kind of an action-reaction relationship. From Wheather or not to pick up the Heavy Machine-gun instead of keep your sniper rifle, to decideing shich enemy to take out first, each decision makes for a seperate reaction, good or bad, you just have to suck it up and live with it.This game's single player is extrarodinary, but the multiplayer aspect of Killzone is where it really shines. There's nothing more fun than Running around on a gritty beach, taking out enemies or sprinting back to a base with a supply pack, with bullets whizzing past your head. The online is fun too, it's pretty much the same, but there's 16 REAL people in a map at once. It's honestly all out insanity. My only complaint about the Multiplayer is that there are very few multiplayer maps, but still, the maps that exist, are THE BEST multiplayer maps I've ever played on.Now it's time for a little "Attacking" I like the way the Reloading and Grenade tossing animations are. It gives a nice touch to an already realistic game, and it makes it makes the game really look like it's title, a First Person Shooter. Here's a Summary of the game:Gameplay: 13/10 A lot of fun, and sometimes tough when deciding whick weapon to ditch and which weapons to pick up.Graphics:15/10 Guerilla goes for an edgy, gritty look and pulls it off. Great character models and detailed environments give this game an above average score in the graphics department.Difficulty: 10/10 Very hard at times, Sometimes this game seems hopelessly hard, but once you conquer that challenge, there's a great feeling of accomplishment.Fun: 20/10 Wheather sitting back with your freind and dueling it out along with up to 14 other bots, or romping through the Single player campaign, it's a blast to hear the Helghast screams, and just all out fun to be in the Killzone.Overall: 48/40 Above Avaerage score, for an Above average game.This is THE game for the year of 2004 on any Console. I don't want to say anything negative about halo, but I personally like this game more.From the way the amount of ammo you have left in your clip (A drawing of bullets in the lower right hand corner) to the overall presentation of this game, it really is a groundbreaker in the Genre of FPS. And it even shows us just how much our "out dated" PS2s really can do. KILLZONE IS THE BEST GAME OF THE YEAR 2004 AND IS TRUEY AMAZING.This is a definate must for anyone who wants a challenging, fun and at times frantic, shooter. You MUST get this game.P.S- this game does have it's fair share of blood, so it's not recommended for anyone under the age of 13. Seeing as dead soldiers' blooding handprints can be seen down a hallway, and even shots that make contact send a plume of blood into the air.

A good product that meets our expectations and arrived, on time, and that's what advertising provider, a good price, and very nicethank you very much
Man. I had no idea what Primal would be like when I first purchased it. In fact, I bought it on a whim from EB games and boy, am I glad I did!Let me start by giving a brief summory of the game:Jen Tate, our protagonist, has a bad encouter with a being from another world, who happens to wisk away the love of her life and puts her on her death bed.Suddenly, Jen wakes up ( so it seems..) and is greeted by another odd creature: a gargoyle, that in my opinion is one of the best characters of all time! She gets told that the world(s) need her help to stop an evil plan that is shifting the balance. And then, Jen embarks her quest, side kick alongside her.The graffics and voice overs are top notch, and the worlds you discover and play in are phenomenal. I mean, if you are like me and appreciate a world that one can interact in and that has a ton of detail, you will love this game!Plus, similarly to Bloodrayne, Jen has some killer femme fatale moves that she gets.Oh, and I forgot to mention: she morphes into whatever creature the world she enters is occupied by.Please, please buy this game and play it. It deserves all of the credit it can get, as so frequently games of this caliber are overshadowed by well-known ones that are highly publicized.Buy this one and Beyond Good and Evil and you will play the two top games on my list!

Start of great franchise and also in my opinion a great start point for any video game player who wants to improve their skills or who wants to begin to play well as this game to just complete requires aptitude with the controller. To get all of the power cells and precursor orbs requires a player with mastery of the controls, amazing reaction time, and the mind of a strategist. Ok exaggerating a little but it really is a good leaping point for those who want to become proficient in gaming.

Item arrived safely and on time. A nice collection of interactive sports games. a good companion to the original. Nice graphics and easily navigated.

My girl picked this as a game we can play together on my Sony II.  Well she is 5 so I do most of the playing.Basically, you get to rotate between Spongebob, Patrick and Plankton through a rather strange adventure.Diesel Dreaming: You start off as Spongebob in the middle of a dream of being a racer.  His bed turns into a car and he gets a crazed crazed game face and then you race.  The racing is ok, I ran it full out the whole time.  You come close to finish but you stop your car just before the finish line and somebody comes by and destroys your car.  Enter the next phase, Spongebob must get his license which runs away from him.  Another race, with Patrick.  Patrick  has a habit of leaving explosives which slow you down.  Again the same near finish with plankton running you over.  Then you must go collect parts to fix your car.  After that a race with Plankton which has a near finish with Gary running you over.  There is another quest to obtain turbo parts for the final race with Gary.  This time you finish but you end up going over a cliff.Overall the racing is easy as mentioned I ran it full out and didn't really need the turbo boost.  There are turbo boost strips and things to dodge all through the races.  Practice as you will need it later.  One thing that is odd is the fact you really aren't racing your opponents as you really never catch them(well I didn't).Starfish man  The Girth of a Hero!  This time you play Patrick as he is Starfishman.  You get calls from a stranger as he guides you through the battle with dreaded Patrick.  The scenes are comic book form and overall it's kind of fun.  Patrick changes outfits every time he fights.  My girl likes it when he is idle and Patrick will grab his belly and wiggle it.  Practice jumping as it will help if you get accurate with it later on.Who Ordered the Super-Size Patty?Now you play Plankton; who as usual has a scheme to enlarge a krabby Patty piece to get the formula.  Unfortunately, he makes it too big and it threatens to attack him.  He enlarges himself but only enough to be as tall as everybody else.  The patty attacks and you spend your time running from it with the help of a freeze ray.  There are short games where you hide in a trash can and collect stuff as it falls.  You have to be careful as the patty sleeps, wakes up and turns around.  You can jump for pieces to get them early or stuff that flies by horizontal.Alaskan Belly TroubleOr as my girl says, the elastic bull worm.  We return to Spongbob as he awakes to find himself falling.  You do some free falling and dodge things and collect coins.  Eventually, you get eating by the worm.  You crash and find Old Man Jenkins who asks you to find stuff to fix a plane.  In return he will fly you out.  The quests are to find the Ironing board wife for the chief.  Three powercell jelly fish for the ineventor and sorting junk for the remaining parts.  Finally, you have to free a blocked chili can which is causing the stomach problems for the worm.  There is jumping fighting and slaping back spit shots from some worm/plant like creatures.  Overall it's a fun episode which is my daughters favorite.Rocket RodeoStarfishman returns as he is flying through space on the rocket.  He has to doge debris and flys into a black hole.  He ends up in a space station where he has to save the crew from asteroids.  He leaves the station and then goes about fighting a UFO crabby patty which is destroyed by shooting weak spots.Revenge of the Giant Plankton MonsterPlankton is back and thinks he was dreaming only to find the patty sleeping next to him.  This time he turns himself into a giant and chases the patty.  It's a fun a game of the monster destroying the town genra.Rooftop rumble:Spongebob and old man Jenkins return as they fly their plane.  Running from plankton (to lure him away from town), dodging things thrown by him and shooting supports to make things drop on him.  Starfishman returns and sets about trying to shrink him back down.  Note:  when plankton starts throwing cars at patrick, there is a ledge you can hide under and not be touched.Hypnotic HighwayThe final part of the game.  This for some reason was hard for me.  It is a race between Spongebob, Plankton and Patrick.  I was able to finish it by taking different routes.  Speed, dodging obstacles and making time bonus points are essential.  I also didn't bother trying to collect coins.Once you complete the race, you will get the end sequence.Overall I liked the game and have played it many times.  Somethings to consider.  There are coins all through the game, pick them up as they have a unique approach to buying the extras.  You have Spongebob pull a lever to get art, music, cheat codes and extra games.There are also plankton and patrick seeds to open up other things but I haven't been able to get them all yet.

I purchased this product for my granddaughter.  She loves SpongeBob and this game!  The pricing, quality, and quick delivery response also appreciated.  Would highly recommend this to other SpongeBob fans!
First off, this game is designed for young kids ages 6-12 maybe. This game lets you play as Spongebob, Patrick, and Plankton in 9 crazy missions and mini-games. The missions are supposed to be their dreams which is weird. This game can get difficult at some points like driving a weird car or flying an airplane as Spongebob, but I got through it pretty quick. I was only stuck about twice. All in all, you should buy this game for your kids and trust me, they will enjoy it as much as I did, which is alot.
"I'am gonna need lots of laundry detergent" (to clean up the town of Dreaded Patrick (Patrick's evil alter ego). This game like the series while aimed at kids is great for adults. I'am not a Spongebob regular viewer but I've watched it to see why it's a hit, it's funny, has bizarre characters and is all around decent show. Making a game out of a Nicklodeon cartoon sounds smart.I've played a few other Spongebob games like the Movie version which was fun. This is fun too you play as Spongebob, Patrick and Plankton. Each character has their own strengths, the enemies are varied and as mentioned it keeps the humor of the show and uses the voices from the real actors. Well done!!!GraphicsEverything looks like a video game version of the cartoon so have to say the graphics hit the mark.Sound and VoiceAs I said earlier, the actors from the show provide the voices. The sound is varied too, everything from a jump to a special attack sounds different.ControlA piece of cake literally. This will take you no time at all. It sounds easy but so many other high profiled games like Transformers The Game, or  Spider-Man Friend or Foe suffered from bad controls. These controls are easy to matter and there is a lot of narration to guide you through.ChallengeChallenge is easy but this is one of those games that do leave you with a smile on your face so can't complain. There is a point in other games where a game is too hard when it stops being fun.ExtrasThe game has a couple of extras but I haven't finished them to see what they are.Conclusion: Fan or Non-fan of the show Spongebob Squarepants Creature from the Krusty Krab is a fun game worth buying or renting.
This is evolution. You can connect your headphones to it and use them as a headset or reroute the sound to the controller while you wife sleeps!
This was purchased as part of my daughters Christmas gift but since she was home for the holiday week-end I had her check it out and it worked just fine.

It snaps right on and does what it advertises. Fits nice and snug, doesn't want to wiggle or fall off. So I'm happy with it.

Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy was a pure platformer at heart. It was more kid-friendly and goofy. Naughty Dog decided that they didn't want Jak and Daxter ending up like their previous Crash Bandicoot so they changed things up a 'bit' with Jak II. Jak II was darker, but not as dark as other games out there. It had the perfect tone of darkness for it to be a sequel to such a kiddy game. Jak II also had almost nothing to do with the first game. But enough of that, out with the old and in with the new. Enter Jak 3:It's been a while since Jak defeated Metal Kor and saved the city...or did he? Now with Ashelin temporarily ruling Haven City the Krimzon Guards don't exist anymore. Instead now they're the Freedom League Guards. Now the Metal Heads have returned somehow recuperating quickly after losing their leader. This has made Ashelin get off the throne thus Torn not being the Freedom League commander so a member of Haven City's Grand Council called Count Veger takes control of the Freedom League. Also, the Krimzon Guards mysteriously return with a new leader. The battle of the three factions continues as they all struggle for control of Haven City. And who do they blame for this problem? Jak of course. Count Veger blames Jak to save his own tail since he's the real problem because he wants control over the city. Soon the entire city believes Jak is responsable because of his 'friendship' with Krew. The Council decides to banish Jak to the Wasteland for life. Of course Daxter decides to join him and for some reason so does Pecker. After Jak and company can't take the sand and heat anymore, they're found by King Damus; the ruler of Spargus. Spargus is a small city in the big Wasteland where other exiled people roam. But it's not all easy for Jak when he's taken to Spargus. There they value survival over all other things and Jak has to prove himself to King Damus and his right-hand-man Kleever. After a while, he'll find ways to eventually get back into parts of Haven City although it's nothing like before. When Jak makes his way into Haven City he finds out that the city is now a destroyed battlefield. But that's not even half of the problem. This Precursor monk called Seem keeps talking about this mysterious Daystar and that the world's final trial is coming. She also tells Jak that his dark powers will eventually consume him so a Precursor(or is it an Oracle?)grants him light powers. So now Jak will have both Light Jak and Dark Jak. I gave this game five stars because it's the ending of the epic trilogy and Jak II was a real good game but don't judge the game yet since it's coming out on November. (...)

Jak and Daxter once again disobeyed the Green Sage, and wandered off into Misty Island, an island full of evil creatures and mysical ecos. One of the ecos are Dark Eco, one of the most dangerous toxins known to man. It changes you at random. You could turn into a scientific nerd, an attractive jock, a rabbit, an ottsel, or an insane madman. Two of these things become reality to Jak and Daxter .As they arrived on the island, they noticed something wasn't right. As they moved in to investigate, the saw two warlock and witch looking monsters, ranting about how to "take over the world." Jak and Daxter ran off, but, before they could, poor Daxter fell into a pool of dark eco, and emerged an ottsel...the rest of the story you can figure out yourselves...Jak and Daxter:The Precursor Lagacy was one of the first Playstation 2 games released. With state of the art graphics, witty comeback and an enchanting plot, this is a must have. Buy it if you're a fan of Mario, Banjo-Kazooie, Crash Bandicoot, Tomb raider or Spyro.

This game is epic and it spawned the best series of shooter game. The only thing i hate about this game is you HAVE to play as the bad guys, If you actually read the story about killzone you learn why the hellghast are all angry and want their planet back. The isa forced them off of vekta and made them move to the hellish iradiated planet hellghan but the people adapted and became hellghast. And they try to take back their planet vekta from the isa around 150 years later, i would have liked to play as hellghast rather than the greedy cocky isa.

Killzone has to be one of the finer first person shooter games of 2004. It is in my book. You start off as Templar, a Rapid Reaction Force (RRF) member, and later on in the game you gain a shadow marshal, an ISA regular, and a field operative, whose names are Luger, Rico, and Hakha. You can choose to play as any one of those four people. Your enemies are the nasty Helghasts. The game does start off kind of slow but it gets better.

Labeled as a Halo 2 killer. I don't know about that... but from the brief demo KillZone looks like a very solid FPS, probably the best on PS2 which isn't saying too much I know. Killzones levels seemed to portray a decayed urban style, with some major firepower at your disposal.  Right off the back killZone felt like a more dramatic and violent game than Halo.  A more realistic feeling of warfare and casualties came to mind.

I'M TIRED OF HEARING THAT THIS IS NOT A HALO KILLER. APART FROM BEING BOTH FPS's, THERE LITTLE SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE TWO...IN TERMS OF LOOKS AND GAMEPLAY. KILLZONE IS GRITTY & REALISTIC IN GRAPHICS,SOUND AND WEAPONRY (THERE ARE NO LASERS HERE.) CONTROLS ARE SPOT ON, ENEMIES ARE TOUGH AND MAKE USE OF COVER AND SUPRESSIVE FIRE TO MAKE YOU THINK B/4 RUNNING AND GUNNING, AND RELOAD TIME IS ADEQUATE (3-4 SECS).HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT'LL TAKE U TO CHANGE MAGS FOR AN M60 IN REAL LIFE?...UPWARDS OF 10 SECS. THE FOCUS HERE IS REALISM, PEOPLE. I AGREE, THERE COULD BE MORE GAMEPLAY OPTIONS SUCH AS VEHICLES, CO-OP MODE AND MAYBE EVEN AIRCRAFT FOR BOMBING RAIDS, BUT THAT'S SOMETHING FOR "KILLZONE 2". THE PS2 WAS PUSHED 2 THE LIMIT FOR THIS ONE, HENCE SOME NPC TWITCH. EVEN BUNGIE LEARNED FROM MISTAKES OF THE ORIGINAL HALO. THIS GAME IS NOT 4 YOU IF U WENT WITH THE HYPE AND LISTENED TO PEOPLE WHO KNOW NOTHING ABOUT GAMES (TOMMY TALLARICO). IT'S FOR PRO FPS PLAYERS AND FANS OF THE GENRE WILL APPRECIATE GUERILLA'S EFFORT. WE WAIT FOR KILLZONE 2 ON THE PS3 THIS TIME.

Hi there, Prince of Persia here - yes the one from 'Sands of Time', and NOT the nefarious pretender in 'Warrior Within'.  I hear people comparing me to Kratos, so I took a look at 'God of War', which by the way is a great game (but certainly NOT better than 'Sands of Time').  Here are my impressions.- As you know, I'm from Persia, the great empire that in its 7000 year history invented the cuneiform, wine, composite bow, bronze smelting, and iron weapons.  Our empire stretched from Europe and North Africa to Central/South Asia, while Sparta (where Kratos is from) was a small city state founded in 900 B.C. and whose decline began only 500 years later after their ignominious defeat to the Thebans.  Spartans are, of course, well known for their iron discipline and prowess in battle, and I have a great respect for them.- On a personal level, Kratos is built to be a warrior, where I was really trained to be an emperor.  I'm about 6'1" / 170 pounds, where Kratos looks to be about 6'7" / 240 pounds.  Kratos is built for raw power, and wields two MASSIVE swords with which he can pulverize stone walls.  I'm built for agility and speed, and endowed with superior intelligence to turn any situation to my advantage.  Kratos will have had much difficulty with many of the platforming puzzles I had to overcome in 'Sands of Time', while I may have needed more power to subdue some of Ares's more gigantic minions.- To be fair, Kratos was not always given proper intelligence by the makers of 'God of War', e.g. unable to rotate the so-called 'camera' to precisely locate his objective, e.g. in order to be able to see the ladder in the Pandora's room, he had to swim around and around the central pool.  No wonder Kratos vented his accumulated frustrations in such brutal manner when the enemies finally came.- Again to be fair, I was not given the kind of magical combat spells that Gods endowed upon Kratos, which I feel are unfair advantages, but then again Kratos did not have a means of controlling TIME like I did.- I, on the other hand, had to exercise my already-superior brains far more, since UbiSoft had crafted the puzzles so thoughtfully and intelligently.  The platforming challenges in 'God of War' are not nearly as creative or well-thought-out.  This is ok though, since as an emperor-in-training, I had to learn to rely more on my intelligence and instinct and less on brute strength to solve the increasingly complex problem of ruling an empire.  That said, I wish I had Kratos' powers to make confetti out of Alexander the Great (What's so 'Great' about him?  Read about 'Cyrus the Great' and 'Darius the Great', who achived FAR more than Alexander ever did.), who marked the beginning of the end for the great Persian empire.- As for the commonality, Kratos and I were both able to save his progress in the same "Mysterious Glow" as I did, were given a 'flying camera' preview of the platforming layouts, cinematic close-ups of special attack moves, moody music and spectacular scenery, not to mention the nubile maidens who help us relax.  Both of us fought mostly alone against countless supernatural evil entities and for NO monetary compensation - both of us are noble warriors and NOT some hack-and-slash mercenaries obsessed with collecting treasures.Overall, Kratos is an extraordinary warrior but his crude brutality (especially against innocent civilians) may make it difficult for people to identify with him as a leader.  He cannot be compared to a future emperor like myself who had to cultivate sophistication in so many diverse areas in order to prepare myself for the day when I take the throne.  Kratos will make a fine general under my command, but only if he resolves his manic obsession with personal vendetta against the gods.That's all.  I hope to see you guys again if and when UbiSoft comes around to actually creating a sequel to 'Sands of Time' that does any justice to my extraordinary gifts and nobility.

I'm about 6'1" / 170 pounds, where Kratos looks to be about 6'7" / 240 pounds.  Kratos is built for raw power, and wields two MASSIVE swords with which he can pulverize stone walls.  I'm built for agility and speed, and endowed with superior intelligence to turn any situation to my advantage.  Kratos will have had much difficulty with many of the platforming puzzles I had to overcome in 'Sands of Time', while I may have needed more power to subdue some of Ares's more gigantic minions.- To be fair, Kratos was not always given proper intelligence by the makers of 'God of War', e.g. unable to rotate the so-called 'camera' to precisely locate his objective, e.g. in order to be able to see the ladder in the Pandora's room, he had to swim around and around the central pool.  No wonder Kratos vented his accumulated frustrations in such brutal manner when the enemies finally came.- Again to be fair, I was not given the kind of magical combat spells that Gods endowed upon Kratos, which I feel are unfair advantages, but then again Kratos did not have a means of controlling TIME like I did.- I, on the other hand, had to exercise my already-superior brains far more, since UbiSoft had crafted the puzzles so thoughtfully and intelligently.  The platforming challenges in 'God of War' are not nearly as creative or well-thought-out.  This is ok though, since as an emperor-in-training, I had to learn to rely more on my intelligence and instinct and less on brute strength to solve the increasingly complex problem of ruling an empire.  That said, I wish I had Kratos' powers to make confetti out of Alexander the Great (What's so 'Great' about him?  Read about 'Cyrus the Great' and 'Darius the Great', who achived FAR more than Alexander ever did.), who marked the beginning of the end for the great Persian empire.- As for the commonality, Kratos and I were both able to save his progress in the same "Mysterious Glow" as I did, were given a 'flying camera' preview of the platforming layouts, cinematic close-ups of special attack moves, moody music and spectacular scenery, not to mention the nubile maidens who help us relax.  Both of us fought mostly alone against countless supernatural evil entities and for NO monetary compensation - both of us are noble warriors and NOT some hack-and-slash mercenaries obsessed with collecting treasures.Overall, Kratos is an extraordinary warrior but his crude brutality (especially against innocent civilians) may make it difficult for people to identify with him as a leader.  He cannot be compared to a future emperor like myself who had to cultivate sophistication in so many diverse areas in order to prepare myself for the day when I take the throne.  Kratos will make a fine general under my command, but only if he resolves his manic obsession with personal vendetta against the gods.That's all.  I hope to see you guys again if and when UbiSoft comes around to actually creating a sequel to 'Sands of Time' that does any justice to my extraordinary gifts and nobility.
To understand Guilty Gear X, you must first have played the Samurai Showdown (Samurai Spirits in Japan) and the Capcom Versus (X-Men Vs. Street Fighter, Marvel Vs. Capcom, Etc. ) series. Guilty Gear X uses a combination of slashing with weapons as well as hand to hand combat, not very different from Samurai Showdown. Guilty Gear X also incorporates the ability to super jump (Hyper jump in Capcom Versus series) as well as mid-air dashes. The combination of these two styles gives the game a feel of its own, allowing players to recover from most bad situations as well as strategically confront their adversary.There are thirteen initial characters available with 2 hidden. Each fighter has a completely unique style of play. The beauty of the game comes from its originality. Sammy gave the characters fighting styles that do not parallel any other fighting game. From Baiken's ability to deflect projectiles by flipping up cards (or that's the best I could make of the attack) to Jam's furious kicking combos, each character keeps their own method of play. Granted, Jam seems to be their answer to Capcom's Chun Li (Street Fighter II) or SEGA's Sarah Bryant (Virtua Fighter), her usage of rush attacks and application of her outfit's custom sleeves in her fighting style adds  up to string combos that the others could only dream of. Even Millia Rage, who fights with her hair, has little in common with Midway's Sindel (Mortal Kombat 3).With out a doubt, Guilty Gear X boasts the best 2-D graphics of all time. Sammy out did themselves in this masterpiece. Everything is rendered in hand drawn anime. Both backgrounds and characters are completely seamless.  Picture being able to control the action during a fight scene in Ninja Scroll (Manga), that is exactly the feel you will have when playing Guilty Gear X.There is not much I can say about the audio quality of Guilty Gear X. It is up to par as expected. The announcer has a menacing voice that announces &quot;Heaven or Hell&quot; at the beginning of every match. This could go either way, I like the intro, but I can see where others may not appreciate the added comment prior to engaging. As for the voice acting,  it was well done. I really can not say it was above average because in the fighting genre, you barely ever get a glimpse at the real talent of the actors playing the characters. Instead, you learn how well they can grunt and yell, with the occasional catch phrase for a winning pose. I will say that the voice-overs do compliment the character's personalities very well.My only disappointment with Guilty Gear X is the over-all story.  In this continuum, a Gear named Justice was created to judge the world. He was defeated in Guilty Gear (Original). Now another Gear must be destroyed, as it is killing innocent people. It does not sound very original in design, but does manager to carry the game along. The characters, on the hand, have very interesting and unique stories. Millia, for instance, watched her parents be slaughtered and burned as a child. She is now an assassin who refuses to kill an innocent. This equals a very interesting ending, to which I will not spoil.Overall, I am very pleased with Guilty Gear X. This is a must own for Playstation 2owners. I am very confident that hardcore fighting players will thoroughly enjoy this game. And although the overall story is semi-redundant, I still give this game a 10 out of 10. If you do not already own it, get it.

My first experience w/ the GTA franchise was at my friend's birthday party in Dec. 2001. He received GTA3 as a gift that night, and we all watched him play it for a while. Lots of drunken hooting and hollering at the wanton random violence and depravity. Running over pedestrians, cop-killing sprees with countless innocent bystander casualties, partaking of a prostitute's services for a health bonus and then beating her to death with a baseball bat to recoup the money paid to her, and so forth. I didn't dig that particular aspect too much. I wasn't personally offended, per se... I love over the top violence in games and movies. But I had something of a political issue with it due to my perspective as a long-time gamer. To wit- for two decades up to that point, annoying "concerned parent" groups had been decrying video games as "murder simulators" that condition and desensitize, destroy the moral compass, blah blah blah. Those groups had always been completely full of crap, but it seemed to me that in one fell swoop GTA 3 was going to make them all correct, retro-actively. I thought "We've been in the right all these years. But now you've released the game those nitwits have been waiting for, and it's finally going to give them the upper hand. Good job, guys." There was also the simple fact that I've always been more drawn towards fantasy, whether it's futuristic sci-fi, swords & sorcery, supernatural horror, a past time period, whatever, I need *something* aside from mundane reality. A video game where you're a just some Joe Schmoe running around a modern city driving contemporary cars... that simply wasn't going to satisfy my appetite for escapism. So, it felt like around the time I was going ga-ga over Devil May Cry, Ico, Metal Gear Solid 2, Final Fantasy X and Halo, everyone else was falling madly in love with GTA3. Especially my aforementioned friend. He would not shut up about how great it was and he was so enthusiastic and positive that I'd love it too if I gave it a chance that I bought myself a copy. I played it for a few hours, long enough to confirm that it definitely wasn't my cup of tea, and I put it away in the cabinet under my TV. It's been sitting in there ever since.I then watched as GTA3 went on to become one of the most revolutionary and influential video games of all time, giving birth to a whole new genre, i.e. open world/sandbox. Naturally I avoided this genre like the plague... until Assassin's Creed. I initially dismissed that game as well, since A) I had never been won over by Prince of Persia-Sands of Time and B) it appeared to be GTA set in the 12th century Middle East. But later I heard that it also had some kind of hi-tech sci-fi aspect, so that piqued my interest and I ended up playing it. Flawed as it was, that broke the ice and got me past my aversion towards open world games. After three Assassin's Creeds, Infamous, Red Dead Redemption, and most recently L.A. Noire, I was finally ready. I opened that cabinet under my TV, fished out GTA3 and started a new game. That was about two weeks ago, and now I've finished it. A lot of it was boring; there's no getting around the fact that you spend most of your time driving around Liberty City. I drive around Los Angeles every day, so this is not exactly exciting to me. Bits of it were aggravating; in the first 30 missions or so the GPS always indicates precisely where my next goal is... and suddenly that is taken away for no apparent reason. I'm directed to go find a "Yardie car" without any info as to just what in the hell a Yardie is or kind of car they drive. Y'know, the sort of thing that Official Guide Books and the internet were created for. But a lot of it was a hell of a lot of fun, and I'm glad that I can finally appreciate what it did for gaming. Thanks to eBay, after finishing up GTA3 I cracked open an original sealed copy of Vice City and started in on that (I can already tell it contains some big improvements,) and I've got a sealed copy of San Andreas waiting in the wings. Now my biggest issue with these games is whether or not I can finish them before I burn out.EDIT August 8, 2011: Since writing this review I've gone on to enjoy Vice City, San Andreas, GTA4, The Lost and Damned, and The Ballad of Gay Tony. I am now a true blue GTA fan. Who'da thunk it? I've been looking up old articles and interviews about the history of GTA and its developer Rockstar, and I found out something very enlightening: When they initially came up with the ideas that were the foundation for the GTA series, one of the most important goals was to create a new game that would appeal to people who normally weren't interested in video games because they thought of them as "nerdy". Being that I had been playing and loving video games for about 25 years by the time GTA first appeared in 1997, it's hardly any wonder that it didn't interest me. I wasn't anywhere near the target demographic.

Snowblind definitely has this style down. They made the original Boulders Gate, and now this. Sure there are a few flaws, but nothing that compromises the overall experience. You can even use your saved characters in the upcoming Return to Arms (con2). Sick, dope, this game is the bomb.

Ratchet & ClankTerrific game with multiple reasons to play more than once and increased difficulty from the original Ratchet and Clank.The story is not too bad either.The origina in my love affair with the series.

If your a big fan of cut and slash then this is the game for you, the game includes a good character building system and is very ally/enemy interactive. At the start of the game you are allowed to choose from five different characters of the usual scource(barbarian, necromancer, rogue, scorcerer, cleric. Whats also great about this game is you can also go online if you have the connection and you dont have to share screens with other players. The graphics are more advanced than previous cut& slash such as baldurs gate, shows some awesome spell effects, main downside to the game is i think they could have made it a little longer, i guess it made up for that with the three different vehicle levels which you can start from the beginning in with the same characters. I think you will enjoy it........worth buying.

I bought this to do double duty for me as a gaming monitor for my XBOX 360 and PS3, but also as my PC monitor for my Windows desktop and Mac Pro. It works wonderfully in both applications. The only downside is that Sony hasn't made drivers available to use it on a computer so I can't use a higher refresh rate.There are work arounds to enable 3D gaming on PC but I haven't been able to find one for refresh rate. I'd love to set it to 120hz.
Great value if you love MotorStorm. 20 GB more is awesome. Here's all you get along with the game:- 80 GB of HDD storage. As said, easy to upgrade, and doesn't void the warranty. Sony actually has the directions in the manual.- Free online play on dedicated servers. Resistance is one of the best experiences online.- Built-in wireless card. I play online wirelessly with no lag.- Blu-ray disc playback. 25 GB per layer... and most games coming out next year will be on 50-GB discs.- PSP/PS3 connectivity. You can access your PS3 media from anywhere in the world using the PSP. Other features too.- Motion-sensing controllers that will also get rumble in the near future.- Built-in multi-card reader.- The powerful CELL BE. 4.5x more powerful than even the new quad-core processors from Intel.- Bluetooth connectivity. Great for headsets.- Upscales DVDs to 1080p via HDMI. (SCE engineers have said they will even improve that by 40% when it's all said and done.)- Rechargeable controllers right out of the box (Li-ion batteries already included). No need for extra devices or battery-purchasing.- HDMI 1.3 support. (Even the HDMI in the X360 is 1.2... not 1.3)- Web browser built-in.- RELIABLE. Less than 1% defect rate. It's not louder... quieter than your desktop computer.- Open online system. User-generated content in upcoming games open and free to download. (eg Unreal Tournament III and LittleBigPlanet)- Great support from Sony. One firmware update a month, and weekly content updates on the PS Store.- TONS of content coming.
A) A PS2 sitting in the vertical stand is one of the coolest looking things known to man. (It's a lot sturdier and more well made than it looks in photos, too.)B) Besides being space-economical and pleasing to the eye, it's part of a great tongue-in-cheek inside joke from Ken Kutaragi, designer of the PSX and PS2: The very first model of the original PSX manufactured back in 1994/1995 had a tendency to overheat, and this would warp some of the plastic parts in the disc drive. Thusly the laser would sometimes get a little out of alignment and have problems reading disc data, and many PSX owners found that putting the unit on its side would alleviate the problem. And so, with a wink and a nudge, we have the PS2 vertical stand.

I have both Xbox 360 and PS3 consoles. And I always preferred the Xbox 360 controller over DS3 mostly because of the triggers.In DS4, they improved the triggers a lot. Also the DS4 controller is a bit bigger now than DS3 which is better for me. Adding the speaker right on the controller was a very nice addition and I love how they use it on Resogun.Hopefully we will see more use of this speaker, light bar and of course, the touchpad in the upcoming games.
All of the other positive reviews of the DS4 are spot on.Former Xbox 360 player here of Battlefield 3. I got heavy into BF3 gameplay on the 360 since it released in Nov 2011 so I have been using the 360 controller for a solid 20 months. You may search Cravit8 on battlelog to see my stats.I also have a PS3 that I got for blu-ray playing and some games.The complaints of the DS3 are valid, it's too small and the sloped R2/L2 triggers can't be used as triggers because they aren't trigger shaped.The DS4 is better in every way.  It is better than the 360 controller and the PS3 controller.  I bought it with trade-in credit at Gamestop to use on the PS3 with Battlefield 4 until my PS4 ships.Sony made this a GAME CONTROLLER, it must have some industry standards instead of typical proprietary Sony software because it is COMPATIBLE WITH PC AND PS3.Just FYI, the DS3 is not forward compatible with the PS4.  There are actual technological reasons for this as the old bluetooth spec 1.0 and 2.0 just don't carry the strength of signal and bandwidth.___________________________________________________________________________CHAT AND MIC SUPPORT:Chat now supported through the controller like it was on the 360. Brilliant move number 1.Industry standard universal 3.5mm stereo mic chat jack. Consumer friendly brilliant move number 2.NOTE: Xbox One retracted on both of these, to much of our bewilderment, but they really want you to use Kinect.The audio jack on the DS4 has a industry standard 3.5mm stereo mic chat jack (4-pole meaning 3 black bands and 4 silver poles) that is the same as most cell phones for the last few years.  So your Apple earbuds with mich or similar will work on the DS4.Xbox 360 headsets, hilariously, will also work with the DS4 with a simple 2.5mm to 3.5mm adaptor that can be had on here or fleabay for ~$1.  Xbox 360 headsets as far as I know do not work on the Xbox One. (will edit this if I get corrected).Happy controlling and chatting!
Caution: This will be a totally biased review. I love Sony PlayStation & I love this display monitor. Also, I will not repeat the entire product description here. I will, however, mention the relevant aspects of my own experience with this product.Firstly, the physical properties: The 24 inch screen may be small for many tastes, but if you live in a small apartment, a dorm room, or don't mind a TV in the bedroom, it makes for a nice fit. The picture quality is excellent - clean, vibrant colors, all in beautiful high definition 1080p, 240hz with 3D capability. The draw back is that the small size requires some rather close up viewing, especially when using it for 3D viewing, so bigger rooms and easy chairs don't allow for the full pleasure of the display. The display is also light in weight, so it travels quite nicely, which is good for me (I work at a paramedic station on 24 hour shifts, so I often take the display & PS3 with me).Set up with a PS3 is a piece of cake when using an HDMI cable - I cannot imagine it's that much more difficult using a component cable or with another gaming system, cable box, or other video source. The display has two HDMI inputs and one component (5 prong) input. Sorry, no 3 prong RCA cable inputs. Another plus, with an HDMI setup, is that turning on the PS3 via Dual Shock 3 controller turns on the whole setup - good for the fundamentally lazy...like me.The display has the exciting feature of Simulview which eliminates the need for split screen multiplayer gaming. It does require the use of the 3D glasses, but you get to play co-ops & on-line multiplayers with an entire screen all to yourself. The big disappointment is that not very many games, two or three so far, support Simulview.The speakers make some decent sound for a small display. Again, though, the small size requires some proximity for optimum enjoyment. However, if you have some decent speakers or head-phones that use a standard 3.5mm head-phone jack, then sound is no longer that much of an issue.The interface buttons are a bit of a challenge. I just memorized that the top button is the power button and the button with the little bead is the up-volume button. The rest is fluff that the Sony BD Remote covers nicely.Out of the box, you get the display, a stand (it is not built to accept a wall mount), an HDMI cable, a pair of 3D glasses w/ charging cable, and Motorstorm Apocalypse. With the price down to around $200, I think the display is a steal for those with a desire to experience HD & 3D on a modest budget & in small dwellings.
I recently imported two Dual Shock 3 Controllers for $59.99. The controllers are amazing. The controller has the standard motion control of the Sixaxis but adds the Vibration function from the Dual Shock 2. The added weight of the Vibration components make the controller much better in your hand then the standard Sixaxis.Also Sony is adding patches to a number of its games to add the Vibration Function. Its definitely worth it, but DO NOT PAY MORE than $59.99. $59.99 will be the retail price when the controllers are released in the US. And you can already get them for that price from Play-Asia.com
The controller feels fantastic. The grip is improved, joysticks/buttons are improved, also. There are 2 jacks on the base of the controller. One is for an earpiece/headset and the other says EXT, not sure what that one is for. The only drawback is that in an effort to sell more accessories Sony changed the type of cable. You need to have one of the new cables to use this item with the PS3 as the Bluetooth feature isn't compatible. You need a USB 2.0 A-Male to Micro-B cable to charge and use this one with the PS3.
The new PS4 controller is a change from previous PS3 controllers. While I haven't played the PS4 yet since it hasn't been released, I do have the controller. It feels lighter than the Xbox 360 controller but very stable and comfortable. There isn't a battery pack like the Xbox 360 controller, instead the battery is built into the controller. You charge the controller by using the micro USB cable that comes with the PS4. The battery can't be replaced and eventually will lose its ability to be recharged according to the instructions, so that means you'll be throwing out the entire controller when the time comes. It will be interesting to see how long that is. My guess is that the controller will get worn out before you are needing to replace the battery much like my Xbox 360 controller did.There is headphone jack so you can use normal headphones which is a nice feature. There is an LED light on the front of the controller that faces the TV and that is supposed to help the PS4 track where you are sitting and can change the split screen if you move. Game developers can also use this light if they decide to use it, like flashing blue and red if the police are chasing you or to show your health level. Not sure how helpful that will be since the light is facing away from you.There is a touch pad on the very top which also serves as a big button. This could be used for scrolling. The trigger buttons have been redesigned and feel much more substantial and very comfortable. There is a subtle texture on the handles which feels good in your hands.Some have been successful with using this controller on a PC and a Mac.Will update after being able to play with it on the PS4.****Update 11/17After playing with the controller for a couple of days, it feels really comfortable in the hands. It is lighter than the Xbox 360 controller. Having the two sticks next to each other feels good. On the Xbox the left stick is moved up on the left. I ordered a 10 foot micro USB cable so I can play while it charges if need be. It was only about $7 here on Amazon.Mediabridge Hi-Speed USB 2.0 - (6 Feet) - A-Male to Micro-B Cable

One thing before I review this on my reviews with 2 or 3 parts to the people who mark it negitive just cause it has 2 or 3 parts and not because you disliked or disagreed with the review All I have say to the haters f**k you! If you mark it negitive cause you disliked or disagreed w/ it that's fine. If you find a review helpful thank you. Just read all the parts of the review. Anyway this was the 1st PS3 game I purchased in early 07. Resistance Fall of Man the sory there is this alien life form called the Chimera they have taken over Russia and migrated into Europe and have invaded the last European country England the U.S sent 12,000 troops but were over ran by some kind of bug that infected them with the Chimeran virus The only survivor is Nathan Hale and had been infected with the Chimeran virus and is part Chimera.You battle through England to stop the Chimera from taking over the last European country. This isn't just another FPS it's got likeable characters Hale Parker Cartwright.
With Resistance 3 coming out next month I guess I'll talk about these 2 games Resistance Fall Of Man & Resistance 2. Resistance FOM came out in 2006 it was a launch title for The Playstation 3 I bought it when I got my PS3 in early 2007. You play as US Army Sargent Nathan Hale he's been sent with a platoon over to England to help them battle an unknown alien species Chimera but his men came under attack by a Spire when they land these bug creatures come out. Hale becomes the 1st person tio come out of a coma. We find later why more so in R2. He is more or less part Chimera he has the gold eyes & can recover from being shot. The game has it's scary moments & great atmosphe. While at a Chimerian Conversion Center you meet Rachael Parker who is prisoner there she also narrates before each level. You have various enimies The Hybrids that are your basic soldiers zombie like Chimera these big Chimera called Titans they carry these giant bazooka's & if you are not careful they will pwn you. They have these mechanical spiders called Stalkerd as well as the bigger things called Goliath's There is a spider creature called a sappers. Finally you have The Angels. I know I skipped over some of The Chimera but hey I did a more in depth review 2 years ago. You battle through various parts of England York, Chesire, Bristol & many others to go to The Chimerian Tower & blow the reactor Hale is believed to have died in the explosion but is found at the end of thd credits by US Army Special Forces. Which I knew it was going to lead to a sequel. Resistance 2 is 1 of the few times I can agree with the critics it is better than the 1st a lot more shoot outs better weapons better game play better graphics it has more tension & better bosses IMO. People whined about no vehicle parts honesty I didn't miss them. The zombie like Chimera have been replaced by these runner type Chimera they usually attack in hordes & punch the s  h  it out of you when you hear the cacoons break oh man you better start shooting.. The Cracken (sorry if I mispelled it) & Levithan are my favorite boss battles. It takes place in the US  you fight in California, Twin Falls Idaho, Bryce Canyon Utah, Chicago You go to Iceland Baton Rouge LA & Mexico. You have just about the same Hybrid Chimera a few others have been added there's these suicide bombers as I call them & The Chamelon's. A creature called Deadilous replaces The Angels they don't return. The Carbine, Bullseye & Auger return which The Auger has been improved. You find out this guy Dr. Malikov injected these guys along with Hale with a serium where they are part Chimerian Hale  starts to turn as the game goes along Deadilous messes with Hale telephathiclly  you are also introduced to The Sentimentals the main guy is Joesph Capelie who will be the main guy in R3. The look is great again.  Like I said people have whined they said it's a by the  book FPS. I hate to break it to them every FPS the past 10 years  is just about. A guy that worked for Iinsomnic Games said "Oh it was failure among hardcore fans." R2 sold  1,920,000 copies not as good as the 1st but a very solid number.  I  know I'm all over the place deal with & I can't wait to play Resistance 3. & I  already reviewed these games in May or June of 09 this was just me talking about The Resistance games. So hopefully I'll be back with more reviews.
Fantastic. Always wanted a gren one. Only downfall was cord bein bent too long in package so it gets irritable with movement.

Before I review this game I would like to give my thoughts on the film Alien Resuerrection my favorite was Aliens Ridley Scott's original film Alien was a masterpiece and Alien 3 is my 2nd favorite Alien is 3rd Alien Resuerrection is bottom of the list it's alright but just ain't as good as the previous 3 Alien vs Predator films are crap for God sakes make an Alien 5 & a Predator 3. The game is just slightly better than the movie but in levels 3,4, 6 & 8 it's got some glitches. doors won't open when I clearly turned the switch on. Controlls are fine if you use analog controllers it's like any other on PS1 PS2 or PS3 FPS. It Does follow Alien Resuerrection story pretty good. Destorying Alien eggs and destroying the Ripley clones and ultimately fighting the The Newborn. But the way you kill the Newborn is more like the 1st movie which I liked. I hope to review all 4 movies soon I'll also review Strider 2 and this game is cool and scary. FOX Interactive doesn't fully suck but yeah they have made bad games.

This is a PS3 exclusive basically this picks up where Resistance ended. Hale's taken into military custody The Chimera are in the U.S and now this means War. So you go through the 1st level you have to be operated on & he's been out for 2 years it's 1953. Nathan Hale is the only returning character he's an L.T now but the characters are great DR. Malikov you know he's slimy & the key to all the problems Capile a bada** Warner who reminds me of a younger version of Samuel L Jackson. Hale is believe to only have 19 hours to live before he becomes part Chimera. It gets hardcore twords the end of level 2 & then the action really starts picking up after the level. You will battle in wastelands & rubble of many major U.S cities like Chicago IL. Certain areas like Oreck CA are designed beautifully areas like Chicago look like a wasteland. Some weapons have returned lke the carbine, bullseye, arguer & the shotgun. But have been upgraded. Newer weapons are Wrath a gatlin gun  there's a burst sniper rifle & a saw gun
Read part 1 1st back to the review Only problem is you can hold just 2 weapons now & running out of ammo is a problem not a big problem though. Some of the aliens have returned but there are new ones. Aliens that attack with a shield the zombies have changed from slow biting to fast punching ones that attack in hordes partially invisible aliens  the are ones run up to you an explode the Titas are harder you have to be on your toes. The bosses are better the Angels from the 1st game are gone the boss is Deadlus who was privet Jordan Shepard. You are linked telephathicly and are on the same path. Hale can't make his treatments to help him and later he finds out he only has 3 hours before he turns part he looks more & more part Chimera. Capelie tells  him when you turn he'll kill him.  The shootouts  in Chicago & Iceland are some of the best in long time. In a Chimeran tower in Mexico Hale fights Deadlus and after he is destroyed Hale touches him & Hale gets Deadluses power. Capelie kills Hale in the ending.
I can honestly say this isn't a favorite of most because of small options but I would like to choose the opposite outlook.I have 2 things against it:1. The biggest problem I have with it is they put 'Ol Peanut Scalp Shane Battier on the front.2. He's from Duke, and I HATE DUKE!Go Heels!I like this game very much, I'm not the realistic hoops virtuoso and unlike some sportsnuts out there I'm not hard to please. If a game has good graphics and generally good gameplay, this game has it 4-fold,I'll like it. I also regret to say there is only one other NCAA hoops game out there, and it's made by 989 sports, the suckiest developers to ever produce a sports title for any console ever made. NCAA MM 2K2 provides the feeling of a heated rivalry or a highly anticipated showdown,(Unc vs. Duke,anyone?)and the graphics on the contrary to other beliefs are nicely crisp and clean, so good, you'll think you are watching the games on your TV set. Now, getting to the final gripe that most have bitched about, the Options, the season is suprisingly satisfying because it takes you round by round through the tournament even if the regular season doesn't show. I have an idea whiners out there, take your favorite team, copy their schedule on a piece of paper and play through the season checking off games as you go and keeping track of your record and then, play the NCAA tournament. You'll enjoy this game folks, I guarantee it.

French developer Quantic Dream, the mind behind the unique and innovative Indigo Prophecy, seems to have finally nail down its formula with Heavy Rain, the highly anticipated "interactive drama", which manages to mesh powerful story-telling and atmosphere with engrossing and immersive gameplay.Heavy Rain's narrative focuses on four protagonists separate protagonists - architect Ethan Mars, journalist Madison Paige, private detective Scott Shelby, and FBI agent Norman Jayden - whose lives interweave with one another. Without giving too much away, the game's unifying "antagonist" is a serial killer given the moniker "Origami Killer" thanks to the small origami art found atop all of the victims, who police have been unable to locate while the death count increases.Staying true to the "interactive drama" genre, Heavy Rain is entirely narrative-driven, as the characters wrestle with internal and external conflict, yet transcends its own newly created genre thanks to an accessibility that grants it wider appeal than Quantic Dream's last outing. It's also an unabashedly dark, mature game, with hints of the film noir genre, as it focuses on its overwhelmingly grounded characters thrust into extraordinary, exigent circumstances, also flirting heavily with the question of the tagline, "How far would you go to save someone you love?" It probes the depths of human nature, among other things, far more than almost all games before it.In terms of actual gameplay, Heavy Rain employs an untraditional control scheme, mostly through commands mandated by certain button presses, that strives to add to the immersion by making movements and actions feel precise and deliberate. General maneuvering will likely be hit or miss among players - I found it to be particularly intuitive, though sharp changes in direction while walking rarely offered me some trouble, likely because I didn't feel the need to stop before changing directions. More action-oriented scenes - and the game is filled to the brim with them, each more intense than the last - are handled with more familiar series of button presses that resemble quick-time-events seen in other titles, though they generally keep in line with the intuitiveness of the control scheme and offer a lot of depth.One other notable aspect to the gameplay is its malleable nature. While narrative driven, Heavy Rain isn't driven by a single narrative, meaning the players' actions have direct implications to the story, and to such an extreme degree that the main protagonists can actually die at various points within the confines of the story. This sense of permanence lends itself greatly to Heavy Rain's gripping nature, while the malleability of the story results in seven different possible outcomes (as well as replayability for those who would like to see all of the different choices afforded to the player and the outcomes they yield).The script is intelligently penned, in terms of both dialogue and plot vehicles. The characters are incredibly believable and multidimensional, which allows you to develop a deep connection with them (Ethan, in particular) and the characters themselves fully develop as the game progresses. The main storyline itself is also particularly clever and bound to leave most people guessing until the end and thoroughly engrossed.The script is also rife with thrilling, intense moments, which juxtapose beautifully with the theme of subtlety and nuance prevalent throughout the experience. In fact, Heavy Rain features some of the most intense scenes video games have ever seen, due in great part to the connection to characters that the strong storytelling and atmosphere breed. Many people might have been put off by fears of "slow" gameplay that's been going around, but the game veraciously and unapologetically dispels that notion; the parts that are "slow" cleverly presented, expertly crafted scenes that draw you further into the world, get you further invested in the characters and all so the game can forcibly shake you down to your very core with powerful, captivating moments.One reason behind the game's success with creating compelling characters, outside of the writing, is the technology. The game as a whole, is a graphical powerhouse; the graphics are unbelievable, and certainly the most realistic to date. The extensive motion capture and attention to detail, augmented by the powerful hardware of the PS3, lend themselves to the most believable, personable facial animation the gaming industry has ever seen, which in turn grants a higher level of connection to the characters, who feel incredibly real. The most subtle nuances - muscle twitches in the face - or blemishes on a character's skin add one more layer to the already multilayered characters, as well as unprecedented believability.Character models have been meticulously crafted to reflect genuineness in the characters, just as the mostly-urban environments have been to reflect an authenticity of the game world. The atmosphere is chilling when it needs to be, while maintaining sincerity consistently. The drama works thanks to subtlety and attention to detail - the most miniscule object haphazardly laying about in a room, for example, gives the room an air of authenticity, as if someone is truly living there. Equally considered is the sound work, which seamlessly blends with scenes, completely amplifying the emotional resonance; the musical score is poignant and artfully composed, while sound effects help further immersion into the setting.The voice acting, however, isn't without its flaws. While the majority of it ranges from good to top-notch there are a few poor accents in the game, which are simply jarring because of how noticeable they can be when juxtaposed with setting (which isn't France, mind you) and other characters; it really leads to wonder as to why they didn't consider hiring any North American voice talent - perhaps even approaching some notable actors - considering the focus on narrative.There also occasional subtle issues with animation (such as an item not entirely being in a character's grip) which, despite their brevity, are noticeable. Of course, this is also a testament to the game's technological prowess overall, because the things that do stand out as flaws are so unbelievably inconsequential that they'd hardly be noticed in just about any other game.The list of complaints about Heavy Rain are slim, but it remains true that it may not be a game for everyone. That being said, there isn't a gamer out there that shouldn't at least give the game a chance - a chance to be captivated, enveloped, and engrossed. It's somewhat hard to do the title full justice without giving away any of the scenes in the game in an exciting manner that hooks you in, but they're better left - each and every one - to experience, not know beforehand, even if it's something exponentially small.All that needs to be said is that Heavy Rain is an incredibly polished, unique title with its emphasis on delivering a mature, compelling story - and, that the game succeeds in all aspects, thanks to incredibly realistic technology, a stirring musical score, excellent writing, intuitive gameplay, and, perhaps most of all, absolutely brilliant directing by David Cage who manipulates scenes - from camera angles to lighting to character performance - with a rarely seen mastery. Heavy Rain is an experience that will stay with you long after you finish its story.
Dark Mirror is one of many in the long line of Syphon Filter games. It carries on the tradition of excellent third-person shooting action serving as the foundation for a twisting plot of intrigue and conspiracy. A sensitive incident at a refinery in Alaska leads to an investigation by agent Gabe Logan and his covert team. What they uncover is not what they expected and when things just don't add up they dig deeper, slowly adding pieces to the puzzle of a deadly conspiracy. In order to keep up with the story, it's important to find hidden evidence on each level and read the files in your inventory. They provide essential details to story progress. Without them (they aren't necessary), it's sometimes difficult to figure out the whos and whys of what is going on. The twists and turns come fast, and apart from the occasional unaccounted for gap due to missing intel, the story is solid. Deception abounds and Dark Mirror feels more like a mystery than past tactical espionage-oriented Syphon Filter games.This time around, the missions are presented in smaller pieces with simpler designs. You can sit down and play through one part of a mission in under 10 minutes. There are checkpoints within these bite-sized areas at critical locations so you never have to backtrack far if you die or do something that results in mission failure. The levels themselves are fairly straightforward and linear, but it doesn't feel too constrained and there is room for tactical experimentation, as well as secrets to find.Most of the time you will be moving, sneaking, shooting, aiming and taking cover. Stealth has always been a staple of Syphon Filter, and it is well represented in Dark Mirror. Doing things quietly often ensures resistance along your path is lighter. However, stealth is not necessary in most cases, and there is no severe punishment for attempting it and being caught. You can get a rush of anticipation as you sneak around your quarry, or you can get a rush of adrenalin when they spot you and assault you full force. However you want to play it, Dark Mirror will accommodate you.When you do get into trouble, you can now take cover along walls or behind obstacles. This is a new addition to Syphon Filter gameplay and while it isn't a new gaming concept, it has been done properly here. Not sticking your neck out needlessly can save your life, but with Dark Mirror's fairly easy difficulty you can usually opt to just stand in the open and fire if you're quick on the trigger. Again, this allows casual gamers to enjoy the action while allowing more tactically-minded individuals to be more deeply involved in the battlefield.Enemies are unpredictable yet intelligent, many times using cover as you would. When they have you outnumbered they take advantage of the situation to put pressure on you and ferret you out.There is a very nice assortment of weapons and devices for Gabe and company to use. Pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, submachineguns, experimental weaponry, explosives, grenades, etc. At any one time you can carry one sidearm, one submachinegun, one rifle (sniper or otherwise), the experimental agency rifle you carry at all times, a melee weapon, and an explosive. The experimental rifle shoots darts of various types: explosive, poison gas or electric shock. Firearms have varying attributes and fire modes, so some are better under certain circumstances. Generally speaking though, most any gun can get the job done for you, so it's almost never a matter of not having the right tool for the job. With all of these toys at your disposal, it's a ton of fun for anyone who loves guns. Again, Dark Mirror makes itself accessible to casual gamers and hardcore shooter fans alike.You also have access to a set of high-tech goggles that have three different modes: night vision, infra-red, and electromagnetic.Armor and medkits are places around the levels and provide a quick refresh after particularly intense areas.The graphics are neat and clean. While the PS2 can push out more dazzle than is presented in Dark Mirror, this game succeeds in looking fantastic in it's simplicity. If you're used to the high-end CG cutscenes of late, you may be a little disappointed in the movies Dark Mirror provides, but the in-game action still looks good.The sound is decent, with some good voice acting and a lot of spoken lines during play. I can't help but feel there could be a little more oomph to the guns and some more environmental sounds, but again Dark Mirror succeeds in its simplicity. The music is provided by several composers, including the ubiquitous Mark Snow. Nothing terribly rousing here, but it keeps pace with the highs and lows of the action.Despite these easy to swallow portions, and an emphasis on simplicity, there is a lot on the table to enjoy, and Dark Mirror offers about 10 hours of story playtime. In addition, there is a Mission Mode where you can replay levels and earn ratings in tactical areas such as headshots, stealth kills, use of rifle darts, survivability, and knife skills. For your performances, you are awarded badges of merit, and these patches unlock additional weapons, abilities such as increased health, and new bonus levels. Earning full ratings for each level usually requires you to play through it a few more times, each time focusing on a different tactic. Due to the quick-fire nature of the missions, this is quick and fun, but can eat up a lot of time in the long run, making Dark Mirror very replayable.Dark Mirror is quite enjoyable. It doesn't shoot itself in the foot by catering to casual or hardcore action gamers. Instead, it allows for both, and does so admirably.On a final note, Dark Mirror was brought over to the PS2 after being made for the PSP. Everything was designed for quick portable gaming in mind. This accounts for the short mission structure, somewhat easy gameplay (it's much easier to move and aim with a PS2 controller), and all-round simplicity as opposed to more complex games like SOCOM or Metal Gear Solid. Fortunately, Dark Mirror is a shining example that satisfying gameplay and quality content don't necessarily imply complexity.

This accounts for the short mission structure, somewhat easy gameplay (it's much easier to move and aim with a PS2 controller), and all-round simplicity as opposed to more complex games like SOCOM or Metal Gear Solid. Fortunately, Dark Mirror is a shining example that satisfying gameplay and quality content don't necessarily imply complexity.
I waited to write this until I had played all of the campaign mode and most of Instant Action mode as I could.Graphically, it is quite decent. The game supports progressive scan (480p) if you have a set of component cables for your PS2.The campaign (a.k.a.: the story) is decent, if a little predictable. I won't give spoilers.Instant Action mode needs some discussion. The manual tells you absolutely NOTHING about this feature.IA is series of specialized missions using the operational areas of the campaign mode, but the actual goal varies.IA consists of the following mission types:CAPTURE: You must find and capture the enemy commander alive. Easier said, than done, especially in Admiral (I'll explain later).EXTRACT: You must find two hostages and escort them to designated extraction zones.ESCORT: You must get the "package" from point A to point B alive.SECURE: You must "secure" three designated locations in the mission area by neutralizing all opposition.DEMOLISH: You must find and blow up a pile of weapons creates.DEFUSE: You must locate and disarm the bomb.RECOVER: You must locate and retrieve The Briefcase. Yes, it IS a briefcase. A white one, to be exact.Like the Campaign, all IA missions have three difficulty levels: Ensign, Commander and Admiral.As the difficulty rises, so does the quality and lethality of the opposition. In Admiral, most of the enemy (all of whom are full-on mercenaries) are armed with Mk 48 machineguns and are quite deadly. In Ensign, they are nearly all just low grade paramilitaries armed with AK-47s and the odd ATK-74. In Commander, you get a mix of the two. In Campaign mode, the enemies LOOK the same in all difficulty levels, but are better armed and more effective in higher difficulty levels.As for the areas, some of campaign zones will broken down into more than IA mission zone. Not all zones support all IA mission types. Only Secure and Escort cover every single zone.Another feature is Campaign Redeploy. This mode allows you to replay any campaign mode mission that you have already completed. You can choose the difficulty, but ONLY if you've cleared that regular linear campaign mode. This means that if you have beaten the campaign in all three difficulties, you can replay any of those missions at will. It does NOT count towards your campaign stats, but does apply to your overall stats.There are PLENTY of other unlockables, which necessitate many more replays.To get these unlockables, you must earn badges. There are 32 in all. As I write this, I have gotten 28 badges, and am working on two more. Badges are earned by completing the campaign in each difficulty level. By completing all Instant Action missions of a certain type in each area. By completing ALL IA missions in ALL zones at Admiral difficulty. By getting certain milestones.This games also can be synchronized with the PSP game SOCOM Fireteam Bravo. This unlocks others features, such as movies and soundclips.There is quite an array of weapons available, especially after you start unlocking the goodies.Now, for the complaints:1. Enemy accuracy is way beyond realistic, especially when they are firing full-auto while running.2. Weapons, like the heavy sniper rifles, which have real-world effective ranges beyond 1000 meters, can't hit anything beyond 200 meters.3. Scopes do not provide realistic magnification. Plus, you cannot fit the High Scope onto the SR-25 rifle. Makes no sense, to me.4. Weapon accessory limitations are also unrealistic. In real life, I could fit a scope, M203/M870 AND a laser sight on an M4 or M16A2.5. One of THEIR grenades can down you instantly. In Admiral, you need at least TWO DIRECT HITS with a grenade to down them.6. Rockets. You have to score a direct hit on ANY enemy to down one with a rocket. There is essentially no splash damage. Not realistic.7. They hit you, you lose weapon lock and stagger. THEY can take multiple direct hits and not even FLINCH, especially in Admiral. I've seen the goons take a direct hit from .50 cal rifle or .44 Magnum pistol at point-blank range and get right back on their feet in less than 3 seconds. Their armor is far better than any armor YOU get.8. "Out of bounds". The absolute boundaries of the mission zone are locked in stone, but NOT obvious to you. This is especially true, and galling, in IA missions. You try to circle around a large rock to outflank, but you get called "out of bounds". If you stay out of bounds for too long, the missions will be terminated as a failure.9. Scouting. In IA, you have be a certain minimum distance from goons BEFORE you are allowed to see them. Trying to recon from a distance with the 12x or High scope is mostly a waste of time. Many times, they will see AND shoot at you before you can get any idea that they are even there. Also unrealistic and seriously aggravating.Overall, it is not a bad game but the inconsistencies and goons literally popping into view right before your eyes can get rather aggravating. At least there is enough replay value to make it worth the investment. I have invested over 51 hours, so far into this game. I STILL have a ways to go to get 100% completion in IA. To do that you have to complete every IA mission in every zone at every difficulty level. I have completed about 30%.
Starhawk offers a much needed breath of fresh air for competitive multiplayer gaming on consoles.  The idea here is somewhat basic, yet completely unique to this genre....a mix of third person shooter (including vehicles), team-based combat, with elements of RTS (real time strategy).  Teams of up to 16 face off against another team of 16 in various game modes such as the traditional deathmatch, capture the flag, and zone defending.  Like most multiplayer games, XP is given after matches, which will unlock various customizations for your character and vehicles, as well as skill points which you can assign as a sort of attribute to take into battle.  The hook with Starhawk is that players are allowed to build an army of structures that aid them in completing their objective.  The "currency" used to build these structures is known as Rift Energy, which is collected near the team's main base.  Whether these structures be walls for defense, supply bunkers, shield generators, garages that house tanks, or any of the other many structures, this innovative mechanic creates a near infinite amount of strategic possibilities for battle that not only demand creativity and smarts from the player, but also strong cooperation from the team as a whole.With such large battles taking place in such large battlefields and so many possibilities for strategy, it is really remarkable how well everything in Starhawk comes together.  The vehicles, from the Sidewinder (think of the speeders from Star Wars), to the armored jeeps, to the tanks, to the awesome flying jet-like hawks that turn into battle mechs, all control in an intuitive way that is very easy to pick up and learn quickly.  A wide variety of weaponry, available to the player both on foot and on the vehicles, will give the player lots of toys to play with and master.  But what really makes Starhawk shine is when everyone within a well-functioning team takes a defined role, and uses strategy to overpower their opponents.  Do you like to assault and destroy your foe?  Build a hawk station, take to the skies, and dogfight enemy hawks and drop cluster bombs on enemy soldiers.  If you'd rather fight from afar, fortify a high point above your enemy's base and shoot artillery from your tank, or grab a sniper rifle and head to the hills guerilla-style.  Like stealth?  Zoom in under the radar on a Sidewinder as your teammates distract your opposition with the big guns, and pick off the unsuspecting.  Like to stay behind and defend?  Fortify your base with turrets, repair centers, supply depots, watchtowers, and shield generators, and hold down your base from whatever breaks through your defenses.  These are just a fraction of the roles you can play as part of a good team.  But "team" is the key word here.  Like the Battlefield series, only teams that work well together and communicate will be successful.  The lone wolf will not only have difficulty surviving, but won't get to experience all the richness and depth that Starhawk multiplayer has to offer.Starhawk offers a great multiplayer experience, and should be purchased for this reason alone, as it is obvious that the single player campaign was not really the developers' priority.  The 5-6 hour long campaign is fairly enjoyable, but largely forgettable.  What it does very well is teach the players the basic mechanics of the game to prepare them for the multiplayer.  The player will complete the single player campaign knowing how to operate all the vehicles, what the functions of each structure are, and have a good sense of how everything comes together.  It does well in this regard, but it is not nearly enough to justify a purchase for the single player campaign alone.If you are like I was, and think that console multiplayer gaming has been growing somewhat stale with the saturation of similar first person shooters and Call of Duty clones, then this game is exactly what you've been looking for.  It's a unique, deep multiplayer experience that is very easy to pick up and play, but difficult to master.  But once you get over the learning curve one, and you land on one of the many amazing battlefields and get your first victory with a team that you worked well with, you will be hooked.  The payoff of victory is sweet.  Don't miss out on what may be the best multiplayer experience on the PS3.
Pros:- Similar to Mark of Kri in mechanics.- A little more violent than its predecessor.- Now includes level bosses and deeper stealth play through the introduction of Rau's sister, Tati.- Most levels involve cooperative play with a computer partner.- Playing with a computer partner is better than I expected. There are times when you just want to let your partner do most of the work while you hang back and throw knives or shoot arrows from a distance. Or you can take out the horn blowers before your partner runs in to take everyone out.- Hint: if you don't want your computer partner to go charging into a fight, make sure you are in unarmed stealth mode. This will tell your partner to do the same.- Partner AI seems decent for the most part but sometimes it ignores enemies it should be fighting- especially annoying during boss levels.- Tati's ability to stand against a wall and then fade into it adds to the stealth aspects of the game that is quite enjoyable. Guards can walk by and cannot see you.- Also Tati's ability to throw or attach poison mushroom bombs to surfaces (including people) and have them detonate when they are near someone makes the stealth aspects a bit more strategic. For example, you can plant mushrooms where the guards will appear through a door and deliberately walk into the open just to lure them in. Also you can attach a mushroom to a guard and when he walks by his comrades it will detonate killing them all or knocking them all unconscious.- Cutscenes are far more elaborate but animated in a consistent cartoony style.Cons:- Story jumps about a bit and can be difficult to follow.

Syphon Filter is one of the most enjoyable videogames currently available ... for any console system.  Syphon Filter II is everything that a sequel is supposed to be ... bigger bad guys, more explosions and more exciting storyline.Syphon Filter is the successful blend of a number of elements from other popular games - metal gear solid, tomb raider and golden eye - and yet it still retains a high degree of originality.You play Gabriel Logan, an agent for a mysterious government agency, that has been betrayed by his own agency.  With his partner kidnapped and dying from a mysterious virus, Gabe must escape from goverment agents, rescue his partner and destroy the traitors.  A fairly standard setting, however, the progression of the storyline is gripping and adds a great deal to the gameplay.You control Gabe with a Tomb Raider style over the shoulder view, with a couple of cool changes.  First, you can enter a targeting mode which lets you take out the bad guys with a single shot to the head.  Secondly, you can slow down and move in stealth mode, letting you sneak around guards.  Finally, the game allows you to &quot;peek&quot; from behind walls, allowing you to quickly check out yours surroundings without giving yourself away.  It is these additional touches that add considerably to the feel of being a stealthy commando rather than some soldier that runs around blazing away at the enemy.In addition to cool moves, you will acquire a plethora of interesting equipment (aka weapons) as you progress through the game.  Each of which behaves very differently and is more or less useful depending on the circumstances you are in.  You can obtain shotguns, M-16s, AK-47s, silenced pistols, grenades, gas grenades, sniper rifles, night vision rifles, machine pistols, armor piercing machine guns, fully automatic sniper rifles and grenade launchers.  If you are really desperate, you can alway light your foe on fire by shocking him to death with your taser.Graphically, the level design is spectacular, each level is innovative and interesting.  Similarly, the sound is extremely realistic and important to your gameplay.I loved this game.  When is number 3 coming?

Heavy Rain is not a game for everyone. This is a mature psychological thriller that engages the player from beginning to end. This is not a fast pace shooter or a open world sandbox, this is a thrilling "Film Noir" experience. Those who can not stand this genre should stay clear away.Player takes control of four characters in Heavy Rain (HR), a father, FBI agent, jounalist, and private detective. The story unravels between all four characters and connections are defined by the end of the game. Their lives are all interconnected as they weave through the actions of the city's serial killer, the Origami Killer. What's great about HR is that players has complete control of how the story runs. Players actions determines the outcome of the main characters whether they progress within their main arc or just die off. Either case, the story will still advance whether all main characters are killed or just a few. Without spoiling anything, HR's story involves the killing of young boys by the hands of the Origami killer. Involvement of the the four main character consists of a father whose son is the latest victim, FBI agent from Washington sent to help, Investigative journalist, and a private detective hired by the victims of the previous family members.Here's where Heavy Rain becomes controversial and it's regarding the game play. The interface of HR consists of action icons that pop before players can perform certain tasks. For example, when players want to open a car door or cabinet handle, an action icon will appear such as press up on the analogue stick, and the character will then perform that action. This is also the case when players are battling an enemy, action icons will appear and if not perform correctly the characters will lose the battle. This is the criticism of Heavy Rain, that it is actually a game consisting of QTE (quick time events). Well this is not true because the differences between performing an action with or without an icon is still the same. For example, if you are going to open a door with the X button, it's the same outcome whether the X button appears before you or not. The other difference between QTE's and HR is that in QTE, events are scripted within a predefined outcome. So if you don't press the correct buttons the game will end. Well in HR, if you don't press the correct buttons within a dire situation the game will still continue on you just won't complete that scene. For example, if you are trying to apprehend a criminal and you don't press the appropriate actions the criminal will escape. Or if you are battling an enemy the enemy will win and you will be beaten up. It's these outcomes that sets HR apart from just being a QTE adventure.I'm glad HR stuck with its control scheme because it appropriately engages the player with the characters. The controls just doesn't consisting of moving the analogue stick around, players will have to press all the face buttons, shoulder buttons, and even the motion controller. For example, when trying to open a window or knock down a door, players will have to shake the controller. This sounds odd, but when played its every engaging especially when your character is stuck in a life and death situation and you're trying to escape. It makes a lot of sense the way the game controls once players progress further into the game. Fights within the game are also every nerve intensive too because if players don't perform well the characters won't either, which effects the game's story.HR also has a huge amount of replay values. The game has many outcomes and endings, so playing through just once will not show the whole scope of the game. Thanks to the games auto save option, specific scenes or chapters can be replayed on the fly to experience a different outcome from the first try. As far as graphics goes this is a beautiful game, indicated by just the screen shots alone.HR still has its many shares of complaints though. First of all there is a 5gb mandatory install, and from my experiences with the game doesn't seem to do much. I'm not quite sure what this install does because the game still suffers from screen tearing, loading times, pop ups, sound glitches, and dips and pauses. It doesn't occur throughout the entire game but it is noticeable. And the ability to not be able to skip scenes when replaying gets tiresome quick especially when replaying the same scene multiple times.Heavy Rain is a very different experience. It's a  mature game, with a radical control scheme, and story that unfolds based on player decisions. It's very beautiful to experience and if players leave all their misconceptions about how games should be played and handled, a very engaging and fun game.

Hi Everyone!I just recieved this as a early Easter gift from my hubby :)  {He bought thihs on Amazon,from a Amazon commited seller} I have been a Spyro fan since his 1st appearance years,years ago.I haven't played any of his games since,well,7-9 yrs? Naw,it may not be all that long,but it has been ages! My last Spyro game I played,was "Hero Tail" on ps2,it was my last game with Spyro,basically because I didn't like the way it turned in his series.Taking out the gem collecting I fell in love with,and side kicks ways as they taught him things,and MONEY BAGS,really bummed me out.As our children grew up,finished schooling,moved out,well,I pulled away from gaming~and just starting to rediscover gaming once again on gaming systems,and on my new laptop.So,when my hubby handed me several Easter wrapped packages-I was shocked~surprised to see this game,practically PRISTINE condition! I was doing kart wheels and sommersaults and whooping it up!!{ok,ok,ok..I was doing those in my head~if I attempted to do them now I'd be typing this from a hospital bed! heh heh heh}....So,after hugging and smothering my hubby to death,and making him his favorite snack{stack of pancakes buttered and smothered with warm Vermont Maple Syrup},I opened up the case,shaking hands,looked at the blue disc,extremely pleased it's flawless,I popped into gaming system....Boy,hearing old but familiar Spyro gaming sounds,watching it go through it's demos,it brought back memories of playing this when our children were home,and we ALL competed to see who got 100% 1st,and figured out any secrets per level! It all came back in a rush :) I actually called up our grown children,babbling like a mom who just got the greatest gift ever,my hubby actually had to take my cellphone,and reassure them all,I did NOT win the lottery drawing,but,instead,recieved an old friend as a early Easter gift.This is a great game from beginning to,well,I'd say end~but I'm still playing it :) The colors,sounds of this game,are fantastic! Playing him on a huge flat screen is even BETTER than the 1st time I played this game,on a old 19"rca color tv{it had no remote control,and was big bulky back that weighed a ton!}I noticed that I have slightly forgotten this game,and Spyro unique moves,but having a blast reenjoying an old forgotten friend.In fact,our children are already begging{2 even bribed dear old dad,in attempt to getting this game to play 1st,when I am done with it! the other one,tried to bribe me with a pogo game~very tempting let me tell you! heh heh heh heh....}.Whether your an old friend of Spyro,or a new friend discovering Spyro,you will love this game! It has a lot of action,and plenty of quests,and will keep you and your loved ones busy for weeks.Well,I have other early Easter gifts to open still,and a Spyro game to play...Happy Early Easter Greetings to you all :)P.S.~ I do advise setting game play time settings,as hours an hours,will go by before you realize it,and your hubby/wife will be in bed snoring away!! Also,have plenty of popcorn on hand-it goes great with this game,and makes a great bribe to a certain puppy{in my case a dauschund puppy},who thinks Spyro on tv is something to bark an chase after! :) :)

I've played the game several times and still enjoy it to this very day. The Easter eggs, knee slappers and devastating weaponry make the game solid and high in replayability.

Played EQ1 & 2 for years, but haven't been back for 3 or 4 yrs now.  Great game.

All I have to say is that Warhawk is an Awesome online experience that no one should pass on. Flying the aircrafts will take a bit of time to get used to, but once you can controll that puppy, its one crazy nice experience. You have so much to do, so many weapons, aircraft busters, jeeps with turrets. Its so much fun, I finally put down Halo 3 for a while to just play this. And for $30 (without the headset) its a bargain. Get it now!
I bought this game for my husband and he spent every minute he had awake playing it.  Wives, if you need a "break," get it for the hubby...trust me...you both will enjoy it!!
This was just on my review list - haven't played in yrs now, but did play both 1 & 2 for over a decade.  Enjoyed them.
