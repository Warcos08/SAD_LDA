I have played the Chinese against the UN. I have, at my whim, subverted Venezuelan revolutionaries, kidnapped and executed executives, run tanks through VZ government palaces and exploded oil platforms. I have launched missiles at reinforced bunkers, chased gunboats through minefields, and dropped shipping containers on the heads of civilians from black helicopters. I have hijacked troop transports, destroyed historic castles and run guns for Jamaican pirates. I have blownup billboards with rocket launchers and run missile gunships aground. I have thrown more grenades and flipped more jeeps than I can count. I have stolen millions of dollars, sabotaged fuel depots, tasked satellites over refineries and dropped the mother of all bombs on a hillside favela. I have dealt with money grubbing gringo mercenaries, ball busting female insurgents, Rastafarian bird smugglers, pierced Irish playboys, ambitious Chinese colonels and drunken Russian pilots. I have swung from helicopter skids and thrown men to their deaths 3000 feet above the jungle floor. I have snuck through government checkpoints in rustbucket heaps armed with only a sidearm. I have called in carpet bombing airstrikes on UN peacekeepers. I have rained artillery fire on office buildings in the middle of business districts and watched them crumble in huge clouds of concrete dust while chomping a cigar. I have pistol whipped dignitaries and handcuffed them only to execute them because I have double crossed the clients who already paid my bounty. I have run armored personnel carriers through tarpaper shacks and demolished military barracks with C4. I have crawled out from under the wreckage of helicopters falling from the sky, victims of combat air patrols. I have dropped fuel air devices, cluster bombs and even a nuclear bunker buster that I extorted from an American general just to get revenge.I am the danger.
Let me start off by saying that you don't have to buy this game from Amazon it's free to download from the official Electronic Arts website; the reason it's free is because to celebrate the game's tenth anniversary. Here's the site: [...]You'll have to download Origin (only 16mb) which is a EA service and then from your game library you can download it for free!The game itself is nice. It is the first Battlefield game to have been released back in 2002. Graphics aren't super, they're alright.It is set during WWII.You can play as the Germans, Americans, Japanese, British, and Russian.What I really like about this game is the "Instant Battles" mode, which let's you play skirmish battles all you want. They are options like enemy AI difficulty, ticket penalty, and a few more. Each map has it's own set factions which fight each other. Like on the Kursk map you will have the Germans vs the Russians and on the Iwo Jima map you'll have the Japanese vs the Americans. These nations are preselected and you can't choose what you want sadly.There are many weapons and vehicles you can use. You can use Karabiner 98k rifles, STG 44s, stationary MG42s (only stationary you can't carry them D:), Browning Automatic Rifles, and many more. All of the vehicles you see on the battlefield are drivable, these include, Panzer IVs, Tigers, Shermans, T-34s, etc. There are self-propelled artillery guns like the Priest, Katyusha and Wespe. A few jeeps like the Willy and K&uuml;belwagen. There are planes as well like the Messerschmitt Bf 109, Stuka Ju87, P-51 Mustangs, Spitfires, Zeros, Ju-88As, Il-2 Sturmoviks, and many more. You can also use stationary, Flak 20mm guns and Bofor 40mm guns.The game has Battleship but you can't drive them, you can use their main 18 inch naval guns though! You can also use coastal guns.There are 2 expansion packs for this game. One is Battlefield 1942: The Road To Rome and the other is Battlefield 1942: Secret Weapons of WWII. I have not played any of these two so I can't say how they are, but from some description reading The Road To Rome pack is based on the Italian Campaign. And the Secret Weapons of WWII adds many new weapons, vehicles, maps, as well as a new game mode. Road to Rome adds more weapons and vehicles.These is a multiplayer mode as well but whenever I search for matches I don't get very many and the one I do get only have a few players playing on them.There is a singleplayer, but I believe you can only play as the Allies... not sure because I've been playing the skirmishes most of the time.It's an old game but it's fun. I'll update this review when I feel there's more to add.

Battlefield 1942 is the best first player shooter that I have ever played.  Everyone of my coworkers and friends, who have played the multiplayer demo, ended up buying the full game.The game is fun, action packed, and rarely dull.  On foot, you can play as one of several classes: medic, scout (sniper), assault, or engineer) with varying WWII-era equipment.  You can also hop into a variety of vehicles (jeeps, tanks, APCs) , naval vessels (destroyers, battleships, aircraft carriers, landing craft), and aircraft (fighters, dive-bombers, bombers) to dominate the other players.

Battlefield 1942 - The Complete Collection comes with the original Battlefield 1942 (BF1942) game, the two expansions  The Road to Rome and Secret Weapons of World War II, Battlefield Vietnam.  I'll talk about BF1942 first. I've had this game a long time, but never got around to playing it. I tend to enjoy single player games so BF1942 for me doesn't beat the classic first person shooter (FPS) storyline games likeCall of Duty: Game of the Year Edition,Medal of Honor Allied Assault Deluxe, andBrothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30. The single player campaign basically allows you to play the multiplayer maps in order with the computer AI controlling all the other soldiers. The gameplay is the same for both multiplayer and single player. If you get killed you respan at your selected control point, the objective usually being kill enemy soldiers and capture enemy control points in order to reduce their starting tickets (points) to zero. Even for multiplayer, I prefer more strategy type games likeCompany of Heroes. Some strategy is required for BF1942 because while you have unlimited troops, time is limited especially if you have less control points than the enemy. Also if you do not play as a team you tend to get torn to pieces by your opponents.Some negatives: In single player, on maps with any pinch points, your teammate AI tends to get slowed down with vehicles doing circles (even with support to AI all the way up). The game crashes on me occasionally when loading missions (usually after playing several missions). You can't see if you hit anything with the sniper rifle as zoom in is removed when you reload. Check the reported kills to see if you hit or scan the field after you reload. Similar it is hard to tell if you hit with bazooka due to smoke trail unless you shift your position (kind of annoying if you cover doesn't allow it). There are countless odd glitches during combat especially around vehicles (these don't disrupt game play much though). Environment not destructible and destroyed vehicles and troops disappear (these items would take more memory).So what makes all these people rate the game so high. BF1942 has lots of features that the other FPS don't have. BF1942 allows you to employ vehicles in combat in multiplayer. You can jump into jeeps, tanks, airplanes, ships, artillery turrets, and fixed machine gun nests. This makes gameplay interesting. The other important feature in BF is the ability to specialize your infantry between assault troops, snipers, anti-tank, medics, and engineers. In this way you don't just pick up different weapons on the field of battle, you get to pick your kit to suit your mission or role. Each have their abilities and weaknesses, but as a combination they are stronger.I would also note that even though this is very old title there is still an active multiplayer community. I was able to jump right into a multiplayer game with a large group of other players with no lag.Battlefield 1942 Expansion: The Road to RomeCovers the Italian campaign. It comes with 6 new maps and two new armies (French and Italians). The expansion includes for the Americans M3 Grant (medium tank) and M3 GMC (tank destroyer/mobile artillery), for the British the Mosquito (bomber) and the 25pdr (stationary AT gun), for the Italians the M11-39 Carro Armato (medium tank), and for the Germans the Sturmgeschutz (tank destroyer),PAK75 (stationary AT gun), and the BF 110 (fighter/bomber). Two infantry assault weapons include the British Sten SMG and the Italian Breda Modello 30.Battlefield 1942: Secret Weapons of WWII Expansion PackComes with 8 new maps and two new armies (British Commandos and German Elite). The expansion include one of each of the following for each team: jet powered fighter (F-85 Goblin - Allies and Natter Rocket Plane - Germans), flying wing fighter/bomber (AW-52 - Allies and HO 229 - Germans), motorcycle with MG armed sidecar, amphibious assault vehicles (LVT-2 Water Buffalo - Allies and Schwimmwagen - Germans), commando rafts, specialty tanks (Sherman armed with T-34  Calliope and T95/T28 Heavy Tank - Allies and Flakpanzer and Sturmtiger - Germans). All in all the allied vehicle additions are the most affective IMO. However, the Germans got the best infantry weapons in the expansion. German assault troops get the FG 42, engineers get the Mauser K98 with grenade attachment, and most importantly the Gewehr 43 sniper rifle allows semi auto fire and you can still see your target (or what's left of them) after each shot. The allies get the Bren for assault troops, silenced Sten MK2 for medics, and shotgun for engineer. Of course, for those thrill seekers the rocket pack has also been added. These can be found hidden in upstairs rooms in certain buildings.The new armies, vehicles, and weapons from the expansions can only be used on certain maps from the respective expansion. The maps are fun and fairly well balanced. However, there are very few servers that actually play the expansions. If you already have BF1942, I wouldn't bother with the expansions unless you are a diehard fan.  But if you are looking at getting  BF1942 you might as well get them all.Battlefield: Vietnam(BFV)There is a noticeable improvement in the graphics from BF1942. Running through the jungle in BFV reminded me of the movie Platoon.  The nostalgic 60s music also provides great atmosphere and gets you ready to jump into the battle. The weapons are fun and extra options for the different infantry types allows for more customization. BFV land vehicles are not much better than BF1942, but the helicopters are pretty cool. Unfortunately my piloting skills are pretty poor so I had to rely on others for an airlift. But the damage the Cobra gunships can dish out with a good pilot is incredible. It also is a lot of fun to let loose with the 50 cal on the Hueys. I would say if you only want a land based game, BFV is really not for you. Most maps allow for aerial combat.I felt the single player experience on BFV was better than BF1942. I think this type of setting is better suited to Battlefield's style of gameplay. However, the AI would at times cause frustration by having everyone going after one control point (and still not being able to take it) while I'm left to fend off all the bad guys trying to capture the other control points.I would note that there is still an active multiplayer community. However, there are far fewer people playing BFV as there are playing BF1942.
This isn't the first, or latest or even the best Real Time Strategy game ever made, but it's perhaps the best first game for those new to the genre.  In RTS, you build up both an army and the industrial base with which to create the army.  There is some valuable resource (here, the famed &quot;Tiberium&quot;) which fuels your war mchine and that of your opponent.  The inherent unrealism of RTS - you build the base and the army not only in real time, but in a rather short amount of it - is more than compensated by the tenacity and resourcefulness of your enemy, the obstacles you face and the myriad strategies you must quickly use to overcome both.  &quot;Red Alert&quot; is actually a prequel to &quot;Command and Concquer&quot; which pit the noble - if militaristic - Global Defense Initiative against the insidious cultish Brotherhood of Nod.  In RA, we find the younger GDI facing a massive war machine fielded by Josef Stalin's USSR.  How did that happen?  What about WWII?  Never took place - Hitler was some out of work painter and Austrian army vet when he died under mysterious circumstances after a 1924 meeting with somebody named Einstein.  Now the Soviets and the GDI fight using weapons that vary between conventional and (by our standards) exotic.In addition to your tanks, planes and ships, you must also contend with Tesla Coils (artificial lighting generators), chronospheres (remember the &quot;Philadelphia Experiment&quot;?) and the &quot;Iron Curtain&quot;.  You get to play each side, and must deal with each one's respective weakenesses - the allies are better represented on sea where their cruisers and gunboats annhilate russian subs;  Russian MiG's, however, dominate the sky).  Anybody whose RTS experience goes no further than &quot;Dune II&quot; (1992) best be warned - this is more than about tank-rushing.  simply cranking out a dozen or so of your heaviest and most fearsome mechanized armored assets and sending them headlong at your enemy's weakest point is not the single strategy.  As an exmple - one mission may have you decimate the GDI base on the other side of the river.  However, there are no bridges (at least none that last very long).  So you've got to build marine transports to carry your army across - but that requires a subpen.  To protect your subpen (which is built on the water) and the transports when they're built, you'll need to crank out subs (which are inferior to the enemy's surface fleet, but remain the only real option).  Also, your transports can only load and offload their cargoes on sandy stretches of shoreline - and the only non-rocky coastline just happens to be occupied by the enemy.  The allies may also have spies - who can walk past tanls and soldiers without being spotted (only your canine units know when they're around), and the feared &quot;Tanya&quot;, a sexy &quot;Rambette&quot; who can pick off scores of infantry like pigeons and responds with the appropriate &quot;Ka-chinG!!!&quot; with every kill.  Red Alert is incredibly challenging, not infrequently frustrating and quite addictive.  An extensive internet community exists for those with questions or those hungering for new missions.  I ran the game on my P-166MMX with no problems.  Those with more powerful systems may want to consider &quot;Red  Alert-2&quot;, but they'd be missing an excellent intro to the genre.

I've played many RTS type games but this is one of the best that I've had the pleasure to play.  The game manages a good mix of the old and new.  The combat in and of itself is like that found in the original Dune II, WarCraft, StarCraft, or countless other games along the lines.  However, it is still fun and the excellent graphics enhance the experience immensely.  Also, there are newer elements thrown in, such as the ability to ally with several different subgroups (Fremen, Sardaukar, Tleilaxu, Ix, and Guild).  Each of the subgroups has different advantages and disadvantages and very different units.Another nice touch that is unfortunately not often seen in RTS games is that units gain experience as they fight.  As their experience increases, they are a little tougher and can do more damage, this is a nice touch and it can make a very real difference on the battlefield.  Elite units are more than a match for any two of their regular counterparts.There are three playable houses, Atreides, Harkonnen, and Ordos, each of which have different units and different advantages.  The Ordos units heal gradually over time when wounded, the Harkonnen units will function at full capability no matter the damage sustained (until destroyed), and the Atreides can return elite units to the barracks to train all their troops to the next level of veterancy.Another nice feature is the ability to retreat from a battle if you feel it is unwinnable.  This can be helpful as successfully retreating will give you a reserve force that can be quite useful.  Also, the designers paid attention to logistics, a real world problem.  If the territory you are attacking (or defending) is bordered by several friendly territories, the reinforcements you periodically receive during battle will be larger than if you were bordered by only one territory.  Similarly, if you have a territory that is salient, it can be extremely difficult to defend.  Not overextending oneself can be quite vital.If I have any complaints, it deals mainly with the storyline.  I found the basic theme of it to be quite boring and uninventive.  In a nutshell, the Spacing Guild decides to consolidate its monopoly on space travel by controlling Arrakis and the vital spice melange, to do so they create an 'Emperor Worm', basically a human-worm mutation with great psychic powers.  *Yawn*  If I had a dime for every time I've seen the 'evil corporation creates genetic superthing' story I'd be rich ;).  However, the story does have its good moments, such as having to choose between one of the two heirs when the Baron Harkonnen is murdered.  This is a nice touch that emphasizes the backstabby, vicious nature of the Harkonnen quite well.But if you can ignore the contrived portions of the story (easy enough to do with such great game play), the game itself is very enjoyable.  All in all, another great game from Westwood =).

That's what I've started doing.  It's a game that drips testosterone from marble columns of Athens to (but not quenching) the infernals of Hades.  There's not much happy in Krato's Ancient Greece.  Well, strike that.  Maybe Aries is happy because he's ripping Athens to shreds.  Fires, thunderstorms, Aries' steel clanging, while the helpless humans fire arrows at the God of War unleashed.  Pah!  Human Arrows.  It's like trying to put out Hades' flames by blowing bubbles.There is so much amazing about God of War.  First, I'll talk about thought.  There's folly about.  That's the theme of Greek Mythology, ALWAYS.  Folly between the gods and "their human playthings".  However, Greek gods are flawed just like the human pawns.  For the gods of Olympus err clumbsiness then clean-up their mistakes after.  What folly!  God of War WORKS as Greek Mythology.  I love the concept of "destroying a god" through Pandora's Box.  Opening Pandora's Box, the colloquialism, is to unleash a maelstrom of unpredictable chaotic events.  Is that what happens when a god is killed?  Absolutely.  This is what I mean regarding thought.  There are philosphical gems that glisten in Ancient Greece.Second, the gameplay and controls are extremely tight.  You'll use every button on the contoller when battling.  You'll use every move.  Rolling/evasion, blocking, comboes that can rise to triple digit numbers (my highest is 124) are necessary to avoid becoming burger to Aries' black-hearted baddies.  This said, tight controls are necessary, work perfect, creating some ridiculously fast paced/intense action.Third, is balance.  Now some friends say I smoke too much over drinking, but I understand balance is required.  God of War balances action and puzzle solving, and not once do the scales dip to one side.  Sure, the game gets difficult and frustrating the further you take Kratos, but never is there too much fighting, too much puzzle-solving, or too much drinking.  Wah?  The balance is great.Did I mention level design?  No?  It's brilliant.  Sometimes it reminds me of Prince of Persia:SOT and sometimes Tomb Raider.  Environments are very fluid, from the details of statues and Greek architecture, to Kratos' ugly reflection on a highly polished floor?  I'd hate to be the sap who keeps those Greek floors so spickitty span clean.  I wonder what that dude makes an hour.  Benefits are worth it, especially if you get to glimpse the Oracle of Athens in her sheer top.  Huh?  Great level design.To add one more edge on Kratos already sharp blades, God of War has a wonderful soundtrack.  The music is ambiant sometimes, orchestral at others.  Should I say it again?  Ok.  Balanced soundtrack.I'll wrap it up.  My wife came down when I was playing and she said, "Honey, why do you have your shirt off?"  I looked at her.  My eyes were bloodshot but not from God of War.  I replied, "Kratos doesn't wear a shirt.  If he doesn't, I don't."

Opening Pandora's Box, the colloquialism, is to unleash a maelstrom of unpredictable chaotic events.  Is that what happens when a god is killed?  Absolutely.  This is what I mean regarding thought.  There are philosphical gems that glisten in Ancient Greece.Second, the gameplay and controls are extremely tight.  You'll use every button on the contoller when battling.  You'll use every move.  Rolling/evasion, blocking, comboes that can rise to triple digit numbers (my highest is 124) are necessary to avoid becoming burger to Aries' black-hearted baddies.  This said, tight controls are necessary, work perfect, creating some ridiculously fast paced/intense action.Third, is balance.  Now some friends say I smoke too much over drinking, but I understand balance is required.  God of War balances action and puzzle solving, and not once do the scales dip to one side.  Sure, the game gets difficult and frustrating the further you take Kratos, but never is there too much fighting, too much puzzle-solving, or too much drinking.  Wah?  The balance is great.Did I mention level design?  No?  It's brilliant.  Sometimes it reminds me of Prince of Persia:SOT and sometimes Tomb Raider.  Environments are very fluid, from the details of statues and Greek architecture, to Kratos' ugly reflection on a highly polished floor?  I'd hate to be the sap who keeps those Greek floors so spickitty span clean.  I wonder what that dude makes an hour.  Benefits are worth it, especially if you get to glimpse the Oracle of Athens in her sheer top.  Huh?  Great level design.To add one more edge on Kratos already sharp blades, God of War has a wonderful soundtrack.  The music is ambiant sometimes, orchestral at others.  Should I say it again?  Ok.  Balanced soundtrack.I'll wrap it up.  My wife came down when I was playing and she said, "Honey, why do you have your shirt off?"  I looked at her.  My eyes were bloodshot but not from God of War.  I replied, "Kratos doesn't wear a shirt.  If he doesn't, I don't."
I always try to find deals on games and well.... Games with a particular year in the title often are marked way down once that year passes so I bought this instead of NHL10. This game is great! The replay value of it is very high, the career mode and game modes really keep the game fun and it's true the jersey's and player lineups are not as current as the latest verison, but it's still a great game.The graphics are good and the controls are very easy to learn.I did upgrade to NHL10 which I got for christmas and it is VERY similar to NHL08 so you could save a bundle and just get NHL08 if you wanted to. NHL10 does introduce a few new features, but honestly not enough to justify a huge price difference. Once you learn NHL08 then upgrade to 10 and learn the few extra moves they give you which includes pressing opps. along the boards, better fighting, etc.I highly recommend this game.
The seller was Amazon. I purchased it in 2003 for 15 bucks. It installed fine on my PC running Windows XP Home SP3. While playing the game, it crashed several times, so I was careful to save my progress regularly during the campaign.This is a real-time strategy (RTS) game. The campaign includes movie-like cut scenes, which are fairly well-done. There is single player (campaign or skirmishes), or multiplayer (LAN or Internet).There are 4 CDs: install, House Atreides, House Harkonnen, House Ordos. For the single player campaign, you can pick what house you want to play as. Although the maps are similar for each house/campaign, the cut scenes are different. Aside from the 3 main Houses, other characters are also featured in the game like Ix, Guild, Sardaukar, Fremen, Tleilaxu, etc.When I tried multiplayer internet, the game went into a continuous loop with error message "error starting internet components, check installation is correct". It's an old game, so the servers probably don't exist anymore.There is a patch for the game (version 1.09).I replayed this game recently, and I thought it was still fun. The graphics, sound, dialog, and game play have held-up well over time. Lots of movie details are included as part of the game; for example, the Fremen Fedaykin can deploy a thumper, call a worm, and ride the worm around the sand for a while (for fun, or to take-out nearby enemies). They did a good job recreating the Dune Universe in this game.I also enjoyed the movie (Frank Herbert's Duneand the book.I'm glad to have this game in my collection, and I look forward to replaying it again the future.Visit my Amazon Collections to see my 4-star and 5-star PC games:http://www.amazon.com/gp/customers/A12LH2100CKQO/collections

This game was fun. This had great artist's from the rap industry, this game was intense. Great character's like snoopdogg, redman, methodman, lil kim, seanpaul, fatjoe, elephantman, xzibit, busta ryhmes, ice t, stickyfingaz, and more. The move's were hot the enviorment was great, you can trow your oppoinet on a car, you can use weapon's, you can smash your oppoinet against the wall, you can do back flip attack's on the wall. The storymode was great to you can customize your character but the storymode was hard espacially when you face fatjoe he is a cheater in this game  but it was a great game. The last part in the storymode when you face snoopdogg was kinda hard to, he back flip's on the wall for advantage to take you out and so you fall out the window but i past that part, i beat the game already. The stage's were great to and the music even though iam not really into rap but it was good.

The other reviewers below have already told you about the story etc, so here just a quick down and dirty from my point of view:Play this game, it's a lot of fun. Fighting the Hydra right in the beginning was awesome. This game has been keeping me awake for the last 3 nights. However, there are a few things on the negative side as well. They pushed the PS2 and it shows, while the graphics are great, the game, especially the sound, shudders occasionally and it seems the voice actors stu-stu-studder. While fun, the game has a repetitive nature, so if the button mashing thing is for you, you're all set. There is some strategy involved in how to defeat the different monsters. Some people have said that the fighting system is a bit weak, however that is actually a plus for me personally. I don't want to have to remember specific button combinations to win. God of War makes it easy to beat the crap out of the enemies, even if you don't remember all the different button combinations, which is a good thing in my book. If this sounds negative, don't worry, you'll have a blast playing it. It's one of the best action games out there, better than Devil May Cry for sure.Henning Thiel

Although, I haven't had this very long but, from what I've played is extremely satisfying this game rocks.  I love the weaponry and cutscenes and dialogue already in this game.  The storymode so far in this is interesting, that gives it great single and co-op play, the AGGRO system in here very sharp and pleasing, you should love faking surrenders and faking death in a hard place,the graphicss are good but not as good as MW2.  This game does however bring back something I love which is BDA (bullet damage action) if you're using the right weapon and give someone a headshot you blow their head off, which really makes a shooter worthy of M ratings. I played all of the online multiplayer modes and they're all great, they strongly enforce teamwork which is what this type of game is all about.  Oh yeah cannot forget about the weapon and mask and armor customization I designed my mask and armor and they're just what I expected them to be you should be pleased too. Now for my ratings STORYMODE 5stars, GAMEPLAY 5stars, GRAPHICS 4STARS, MULTIPLAYER 3stars and CO-OP 5stars. This one kick-ass game you won't regret.  ARMY OF TWO: THE 40th DAY 5stars

Hi-Diddly-Ho There! Ned Flanders at your ser-viddly-ervice!!!The Game starts out with the Simpsons watching the news and they find out That Homer's boss, C. Montgomery Burns has bought the bus company and has made the buses radioactive. The citizens of Springfield won't stand for it. They are forced to turn their cars into cabs and boycott the buses, while collecting money to buy back the bus comnpany.This is one awesome game. If you're a big Simpsons fan, like me, you'll love this game. One strange thing about this game is that its just like Crazy Taxi in every way, except there is a primary objective that must be completed to beat the game, (collect a million dollars to buy back the bus company.) You can play with about eighteen characters and play on six levels. As far as game play goes, it is awesome. Graphics are phenominal and another cool thing is that the characters sound and look just as they do on the show. Here are the characters you can play with (their cars and best asset are also listed)Homer: Family Sedan  (All around)Marge: Convero  (All Turning)Bart: Soap Box Racer  (Acceleration)Lisa: Electric Car  (Acceleration)Grandpa: Go-Cart  (Speed)Professor Frink: Hover Car  (Best overall) (My Favorite!)Flanders: Station wagon  (All Around)Krusty the Clown: Clown Car  (Turning)Apu: Sports car  (Speed)Homer: Mr. Plow  (All Around)Snake:Lil' Bandit  (All Speed)Chief Wiggum: Cop Car  (Turning)Barney: Plow King  (All Power)Otto: School Bus  (Power)Moe: Sedan  (Turning)Groundskeeper Willie: Tractor  (Speed)Reverend Lovejoy: Book-Burning Mobile (Power)And Six Real Simpsons Boards:Evergreen Terrace  (Where The Simpsons live)Entertainment District(Where Moe's Tavern is)Springfield DamNuclear Power Plant  (Where Homer Works)DowntownSpring Field MontainsThere is only one flaw to this entire game, not all the characters in the Simpsons Show are involved in the game. other than that its perfect. So, what are you waiting for? Get it now!P.S. Vote Quimby!!!

I received this game for Christmas, and it's one of the best games ever!! My family and I play this game all the time, the multiplayer is fun for the whole family! This game is very high in replay value, because you have to raise 1 million$ to buy back the bus system from Mr. Burns. Along the way, you'll be able to unlock new levels and cars. The city of Springfield is jam-packed with familiar locales, like The Simpsons house, Kwik-E-Mart, Moe's Tavern, Springfield Elementary, The Nuclear Power Plant, Springfield Mall, Krusty Burger, even Moe's ramshackled house, and many many many many more! You can fly through the streets, crashing cars and flipping them, drive off bridges and highways, run over pedestrians, smash through trees,mailboxes,playground equipment, even Groundskeeper Willy's shack, and practically anything you see. You can pick as your driver Homer,Marge,Bart,Lisa,Flanders,Moe,Snake,Rev. Lovejoy,Prof. Frink,Otto, and many more, who all have their signature cars, like Homer in the station wagon, Marge in the Canyonero, Otto in his bus, Snake in Lil' Bandit, Krusty in his clown car, Mr. Plow (Homer) in his snow plow, and Moe in his flower sedan. Everybody you see in the show is practically in the game, either as drivers, passengers, or pedestrians, and they all say hilarious phrases, like Homer saying &quot;Did I do great or really great&quot; or &quot;D'oh!&quot;, Frink saying &quot;There is so much driving, and crashing, and the hoy-glavin!&quot; or &quot;The collision! It hurts mee!&quot;  and Moe saying &quot;Hope you didn't puke&quot; or &quot;Ow! I sat on my 'roids!&quot; which will keep you laughing the whole trip through town. This is immediatly worth buying, and no Gamecube owner should be without this game. BUY! IT! NOW!

The Simpsons Road Rage is a better remake of Crazy Taxi.  You pick up citizens of Springfield: like Homer, Bart, Moe,Marge, Lisa, Barney and many many others.  This game is really fun if you're a hardcore Simpsons fan (and you know I am).Each Character drives a different car: Lisa druves an Eletric Car, Bart drives a soap box derby car, Homer can drive two cars: Family Sadan and the ever-popular Mr. Plow.  This game has the same point as Crazy Taxi: get people to the place they wanna be and don't be slow!

As a big Crash fan, I could not help but love this game. Not as good as Crash Bash because it's too easy but enjoying all the way. Another Naughty Dog classic with your favorite bandicoot in it along with Dr Neo Cortex, Tiny Tiger, Coco, N. Gin, Dingodile, Polar, Pura, Ripper Roo, Papu Papu, Komodo Joe, Pinstripe, Fake Crash, Penta Penguin, and more. I can't wait until Crash Nitro Kart, the game that will be coming for the Playstation 2. Two thumbs up! Plus, it's one of the games that does not get tiring. As Dingodile would say, G'Bye!

Unlike state of Emergency, this game allows u to do so much.  The worst city in America, but 2 u, it makes u fell proud 2 be there.  Well anyway u gotta be outta yo mind if u have a PS2 and don't own dis

Racing games aren't my favorite type of games. In fact, they usually [smell](the only good one I've played before "Crash Team Racing" was that old game "Wipeout"). This game was rather good for a racing game, but the only reason why I bought it was because it was a Crash game, and I've been following the Crash Bandicoot Trilogy since the very beginning.This game has good graphics and power-ups, but sometimes it's quite difficult, like when you have to acquire Gems and CTR Tokens by going through impossibly difficult levels in a very short amount of time. The best thing about this, I think, was the story(which is one thing that "Mario Kart 64" didn't have at all). The story for this game was good because of it's uniqueness. Instead of having to battle Dr. Cortex and Uka Uka again, Crash has to challenge a new enemy, an alien named Nitros Oxide, to a race that will decide the fate of the Earth itself. Not only that, but this sudden turn of events forces Crash and Cortex to actually team up for the first time ever(except ofcourse if for some reason you consider Cortex fooling Crash to acquire the Crystals for him in Part 2 "teaming up"). Not only that, but Crash and Cortex's friends and minions( Coco, Polar, Tiny, Dingodile, etc.) also join in to make sure Nitros Oxide doesn't take over the world for himself and leave Cortex out of it.I would give this game 3 and a half stars, but I gave it a 4 cause, as I've said before, I love Crash to much to give him a 3.

The best thing about this, I think, was the story(which is one thing that "Mario Kart 64" didn't have at all). The story for this game was good because of it's uniqueness. Instead of having to battle Dr. Cortex and Uka Uka again, Crash has to challenge a new enemy, an alien named Nitros Oxide, to a race that will decide the fate of the Earth itself. Not only that, but this sudden turn of events forces Crash and Cortex to actually team up for the first time ever(except ofcourse if for some reason you consider Cortex fooling Crash to acquire the Crystals for him in Part 2 "teaming up"). Not only that, but Crash and Cortex's friends and minions( Coco, Polar, Tiny, Dingodile, etc.) also join in to make sure Nitros Oxide doesn't take over the world for himself and leave Cortex out of it.I would give this game 3 and a half stars, but I gave it a 4 cause, as I've said before, I love Crash to much to give him a 3.
My 6yr old got into skating so I bought him SKATE 3. He loved it, eventually I got SKATE 2 and then SKATE. SKATE 3 is a great game, but this is where it all started. He loves ROB DYRDEK, and yeas he is in this game!!! Controls are soooooooo much better than the tony hawk games. In SKATE 2 and SKATE 3 you can leave your board and walk, in SKATE you cannot
whoever wrote the poopsmith is back in town is wierd. there is no nudity what so ever. the crashes are insane and not like little kids gettin boo boos. enough with that i'm goin crazy because i read that review. the story mode is a crash tour. you go around 3 continents and crash every where including races. when you crash they have somthing called impact time where you can preform aftertouch takedowns aka crashed crashes. you crash around the world and get trophies which lead to fast crashing cars. like in ssx 3 there is a radio man. in stead of radio big it's crash fm. 2 player mode is cool because it could be a duel with your friend or a race with coms. did i leave a review on this game beacuase i'm not sure? back to poopsmith review, do you go on homestarrunner.com because there's a poop smith on that website.

PLAY,CREATE,SHARELittleBig Planet solo para el Playstation 3, en un juego muy divertido, parece simple pero tambien es muy desafiante, del estilo de Super Mario, LittleBigPlanet nos invita a sumergirnos en un mundo de fantasia donde la creatividad es la orden del dia. Aunque sus graficos parezcan pocos sofisticado, la belleza de los mismos se apreciaen en HD (720p) texturas, efectos, disenos, mundos, y lo mejor de todo la personalizacion del personaje principal Sackboy/sackgirl que hace que cada uno sea distinto y unico.Perfecto para toda la familia, los pequenos de la casa se divertiran y los mas grandes tambien, no solo con los niveles disponibles en en el discom sino la gran cantidad de DLC que constantemente se lanza atraves de la PlayStation Network tanto de niveles, trajes y demas que se puedan imaginar.Multiplayer: FANTASTICO, es que este juego se disfruta mas en compania (sea local o online)El Online: IMPRESIONANTE. no solo te permite jugar en linea con hasta 4 participantes mas, sino que al poder los usuarios crear "mundos" y subirlos, encontraras niveles nuevos todos los dias, de todas las tematicas, solo la imaginacion es tu limite y como dice el comercial "you never finish LittleBigPlanet", y es cierto, siempre hay retos y aventuras nuecas esperando a un click de distancia y todo de manera sencialla de obtener.LittleBigPlanet, un videojuego que no puede faltar en ninguna coleccion de Playstation 3 que se precie, no importa si eres hard core gamer u casual camer, no importa si te gustan los shooters o las plataformas, el arcade o la simulacion, es un MUST HAVE.A que esperas para tenerlo?
Un juego para toda la familia, entretenido y ademas promueve la creatividad enormemente.Quizas todo su potencial estan mas alla de las capacidades de un ni&ntilde;o de 8 o menos, sin embargo la diversion que brinda es suficiente para recomendarlo a ni&ntilde;os de esa edad.Un buena introduccion a comunidades virtuales para los menores donde no solo expresan su personalidad con atuendos y demas, sino que desarrollan la imaginacion creando mundos propios que por mas simple que sean los reconfortan al saber que pueden compartirlos.Definitivamente recomendable si se tienen ni&ntilde;os, para adultos creo que la mayor diversion se obtiene compartiendo con ellos en este Pegue&ntilde;o Gran Mundo que es LBP.
Terriffic Game!En este review no puedo decir algo nuevo de lo que ya se ha comentado sobre este juego. Historia Tremenda! (Como es costumbre en la serie) Graficos Increibles y accion frenetica desde el inicio del juego (comienza justo donde finalizo GOW II), Jefes Imponentes y con efectos sumamente logrados, de lo mejor en graficos que existe para el PS3, y la jugabilidad simple y adictiva que ha hecho de la serie GOW todo un exito en todas sus versiones. Dicho esto solo puedo recomendar el Juego, no puede faltar en cualquier coleccion que se precie de PS3.PROS:-Excelente historia (unida a la 2 entregas anteriores), forma un cierre epico de la saga.-Excelente Gameplay.-Excelentes Graficos (los efectos de luz, de lo mejor que hay en PS3).-Mucha diversion.CONS:Duracion (que no es lo mismo que durabilidad) el modo historia se puede culminar entre 9 y 12 horas, muy poco.. pero en su favor tienes que esas 12 horas seran de pura adrenalina, diversion, jefes epicos, historia trepidante..PD:Si deseas disfrutar de este juego mas aun te recomiendo que compres primeroGod of War: Collection, de verdad que no te arrepentiras, y junto con este, hacen un JUEGO EPICO!
un demo jugable lo hace uno pensar que no necesita el juego pues te puedes pasar horas y horas divirtiendote con elpero una vez sumido en el juego siempre llega la cosquilla de otros mundos, otras variaciones, etc.ya compre el juego a un excelente precio y ahora la cosquilla me da por los adds-on disponiblesmi unica queja es que uno acostumbrado a jugar "Capturando la Bandera" en el demo, como que decepciona que la mayoria de las partidas creadas por los usuarios sean de Death Match individual
Desde hace rato estos t&iacute;tulo me hab&iacute;an aburrido, sin embargo al leer algunos review en p&aacute;ginas especializadas me llam&oacute; la atenci&oacute;n los comentarios positivos que ten&iacute;a el juego, digamos que esto me anim&oacute; a adquirirlo. Oh sorpresa! todo los comentarios estaban en lo correcto. Definitivamente este juego rescata la escencia de la saga, la escencia de un juego arcade de autos de carrera. Creanme, vale la pena tenerlo, adem&aacute;s dificilmente es un juego que pierda el replay value ya que en todo momento se presenta un reto distinto.Adem&aacute;s los gr&aacute;ficos est&aacute;n muy buenos.Recomendado al 100%
Half Life 2 Episode 1, es la continuacion de Half Life 2 y mucho mas.  Me atreveria a decir que a pesar de lo corto de su duraci&oacute;n, hay mucha mas diversion de la que hay en todo HL2.Salvese quien pueda-------------------Al final de HL2 el Dr. Freeman logro detener la huida del Dr. Breen y destruyo el reactor en la cima de la citadela.  Y GMan lo puso en estasis de nuevo.  Ahora la mision es escapar de ciudad 17 junto con Alyx Vance antes que el reactor explote.  Es aqui donde los problemas empiezan.Me siento solo----------------Bueno, esta vez el Dr. Freeman no est&aacute; solo, se encuentra acompa&ntilde;ado de Alyx quien esta vez har&aacute; un poco mas que solo abrir puertas y hacer comentarios graciosos.  Ahora ambos estan juntos y deben luchar para habrirse paso atravez de una ciudad en caos.&iquest;Qu&eacute;... Ya?----------------------La accion se desarrolla sin dar respiro y afortunadamente los desafios son tan variados que cuando menos lo sientas el juego termin&oacute;. El juego es relativamente corto, unas 5 o 6 horas de juego. Sin embargo la canitidad ha sido sustituida por calidad, pues al final te sentiras satisfecho y con ganas de m&aacute;s.  A esperar el episodio 2.Calificacion:Graficas: 9Sonido: 9Control: 8Historia: 8-------------Diversion: 9
Aunque no he podido utilizar todas las caracter&iacute;sticas del juego, en sus intrucciones advierte que puede haber problemas de compatibilidad con Los Sims y la expansi&oacute;n Los Sims Universitarios sino se siguen las recomendaciones de instalaci&oacute;n.Por otro lado, he bajado mas de 1000 objetos, personajes, ropas, formas de ojos, maquillaje, etc de la p&aacute;gina WDS y al comenzar el juego advierte que puede haber problemas con algunas de esas descargas y las tengo deshabilitadas mientras conozco totalmente el juego.La empresa EA Games ofrece Online un programa para chequear si las descargas est&aacute;n comprobadas y registradas en su base de datos, pero a&uacute;n as&iacute; el juego Los Sims 2 Noct&aacute;mbulos advierte que pese a esta comprobaci&oacute;n puede haber inestabilidad en el juego.Las nuevas herramientas de construcci&oacute;n son maravillosas, as&iacute; como la creaci&oacute;n de los centros nocturnos.
para jugar este juego!! tienes que tener internet!! sin internet no se puede jugar!! eso es la unika queja!! jajaja pero el juego es increible!! nunk se aburriran de el!! cada partido es diferente! unos ladilla pero otros son increibles!! es muy bueno!! y esta version es mejor por que no consume memoria en el play trae el headset para comunicarse con la gente!! es muy bueno!
Creo que es un muy bonito juego y la descripcion del partido por Luis Enrique De La Cerna es espectacular, solo jugue con el una vez ya que lo compre para un amigo, pero creo que lo comprare para mi PS3, espero que aun sea mejor.
Escencialmente es un juego para todos aquellos que les gusten los juegos de acci&oacute;n, o sean fans o no tengan PS3. Es uan excelene colecci&oacute;n. Y son 2 juegazaasos. Graficamente no compite con los juegos nativos de ps3, pero aun as&iacute; es mucho mejor en muchos mas aspectos. Y sabiendo que son juegos de psp, es claro que las graficas son grandiosas y que los desarrolladores son magos.Recomendadisimo!

I bought this to do double duty for me as a gaming monitor for my XBOX 360 and PS3, but also as my PC monitor for my Windows desktop and Mac Pro. It works wonderfully in both applications. The only downside is that Sony hasn't made drivers available to use it on a computer so I can't use a higher refresh rate.There are work arounds to enable 3D gaming on PC but I haven't been able to find one for refresh rate. I'd love to set it to 120hz.
This game runs great with no lag with all the Game graphics on High settings.My PC Specs:MB GIGABYTE GA-MA790XT-UD4P AM3CPU AMD Phenom II X2 550 AM3Memory 4GB G.Skill DDR3 1333 MHzVideo Card ATi SAPPHIRE HD 3650PSU Corsair 650 WattsOS XP Pro 32bit
All of the other positive reviews of the DS4 are spot on.Former Xbox 360 player here of Battlefield 3. I got heavy into BF3 gameplay on the 360 since it released in Nov 2011 so I have been using the 360 controller for a solid 20 months. You may search Cravit8 on battlelog to see my stats.I also have a PS3 that I got for blu-ray playing and some games.The complaints of the DS3 are valid, it's too small and the sloped R2/L2 triggers can't be used as triggers because they aren't trigger shaped.The DS4 is better in every way.  It is better than the 360 controller and the PS3 controller.  I bought it with trade-in credit at Gamestop to use on the PS3 with Battlefield 4 until my PS4 ships.Sony made this a GAME CONTROLLER, it must have some industry standards instead of typical proprietary Sony software because it is COMPATIBLE WITH PC AND PS3.Just FYI, the DS3 is not forward compatible with the PS4.  There are actual technological reasons for this as the old bluetooth spec 1.0 and 2.0 just don't carry the strength of signal and bandwidth.___________________________________________________________________________CHAT AND MIC SUPPORT:Chat now supported through the controller like it was on the 360. Brilliant move number 1.Industry standard universal 3.5mm stereo mic chat jack. Consumer friendly brilliant move number 2.NOTE: Xbox One retracted on both of these, to much of our bewilderment, but they really want you to use Kinect.The audio jack on the DS4 has a industry standard 3.5mm stereo mic chat jack (4-pole meaning 3 black bands and 4 silver poles) that is the same as most cell phones for the last few years.  So your Apple earbuds with mich or similar will work on the DS4.Xbox 360 headsets, hilariously, will also work with the DS4 with a simple 2.5mm to 3.5mm adaptor that can be had on here or fleabay for ~$1.  Xbox 360 headsets as far as I know do not work on the Xbox One. (will edit this if I get corrected).Happy controlling and chatting!
This is a good game and the graphics are pretty good.  In order to run this game on Windows XP Home Edition, you will need to run this in Windows Compatibility Mode (I got this to run in Windows 2000 compatibility mode).  Trying to run this game Windows XP results in a &quot;Lock-up&quot; of the PC. The Windows 95/98 gave an enumeration error and Windows NT 4.0 wouldn't run at all.  We have an older Joystick that is connected to the PC using a Serial to USB converters (USB Nest).  The joystick had to be disconnected from the PC in order to get Madden NFL 2001 to run. A joystick that has a USB connector will work without any problems.

Great value if you love MotorStorm. 20 GB more is awesome. Here's all you get along with the game:- 80 GB of HDD storage. As said, easy to upgrade, and doesn't void the warranty. Sony actually has the directions in the manual.- Free online play on dedicated servers. Resistance is one of the best experiences online.- Built-in wireless card. I play online wirelessly with no lag.- Blu-ray disc playback. 25 GB per layer... and most games coming out next year will be on 50-GB discs.- PSP/PS3 connectivity. You can access your PS3 media from anywhere in the world using the PSP. Other features too.- Motion-sensing controllers that will also get rumble in the near future.- Built-in multi-card reader.- The powerful CELL BE. 4.5x more powerful than even the new quad-core processors from Intel.- Bluetooth connectivity. Great for headsets.- Upscales DVDs to 1080p via HDMI. (SCE engineers have said they will even improve that by 40% when it's all said and done.)- Rechargeable controllers right out of the box (Li-ion batteries already included). No need for extra devices or battery-purchasing.- HDMI 1.3 support. (Even the HDMI in the X360 is 1.2... not 1.3)- Web browser built-in.- RELIABLE. Less than 1% defect rate. It's not louder... quieter than your desktop computer.- Open online system. User-generated content in upcoming games open and free to download. (eg Unreal Tournament III and LittleBigPlanet)- Great support from Sony. One firmware update a month, and weekly content updates on the PS Store.- TONS of content coming.
Very comfortable controller, very impressed with the design changes. Will be hard to go back to using PS3 controllers. Controller is a bit bigger and elongated and feels better in adult hands. Very light and feels sturdy. Really like the idea of a touchpad on the controller too!The blue light on the front doubles as a light therapy device to keep you awake for long hours of gaming! After awhile if you tilt the controller up the blue light hits your retinas and you will start to feel the effects similar to the Philips goLITE Blu Light therapy device.Philips goLITE BLU Light Therapy Device
Before I go any further I just want to state that my son is the one who plays this game, I do occasionally play the game at his instance.Anyways, my son (Age 13) had recieved this game from a friend who at the time did not own a PC with the correct graphics card to play it. So he gave it to my son since he knew that his PC's were very capable of playing this game and he has been playing it to death ever since. He primarily plays the game on-line against other players in campaign mode and loves the variety of maps, choice of weapons, and different vehicles (including helicopters and Jet Airplanes). The Graphics for this game is still very good and looks great on a ATI 4000 series or higher Video Card, Ok granted it's not going to look like or hold a torch to Battlefield 3's graphics but for a 7 year old game it still looks good.He so loves this game so much he brought a copy of the game for his laptop and got his sister (Age 9) hooked on the game so she ended up buying the Game for herself and put it on her laptop. Now he has LAN partys with his friends and family at the house.FOR WINDOWS VISTA and 7 users PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING !!! (see Below)This game was originally designed to play on Windows XP (32 bit version) when released 7 years ago, However this WILL work with Windows Vista and Windows 7. First make sure the PC you are loading is connected to the internet, Then go to install the game and enter your product keys as normal but durring the install you may recieve some warning erros like "Only tested on Windows XP 32 Bit", "Can't open **** file", and so forth. Just hit the "OK" or "Ignore" buttons until it gets through the installation. It will then start querying the EA Battlefield 2 servers for the upgrade patches for the game and let you know when to install. THis may take serval minutes in between each patch so be patient and most importantly DO NOT EXIT THE INSTALL Windows. The entire process may take up to 60 to 90 minutes to complete. When completed it will indicate installtion complete and you should be able to start the game and start playing.The minimum system requirements are as follows for your PC Rig...CPU: Intel Pentium 4 or Celeron D CPU 1.7 GHz along with AMD Athlon XP or Sempron EquivilantRAM: 512 MB (Windows XP) 1GB (Windows Vista or Windows 7)Harddrive: 2.3 GB hard disk space (Probably 3GB needed after patching)Videocard: Radeon 8500 or GeForce FX 5700 DirectX compatible 128 MB graphics card or higher (Intergrated Intel Graphics Cards are NOT Supported by this game)Operating Systems: Windows XP (32 and 64 bit), Windows Vista (32 or 64 bit)*, Windows 7 (32 or 64 bit)** For Windows Vista and Windows 7 all applicable patches must be downloaded and applied first for Battlefield 2 to work on these two operating systems, In it's "Out of the box" state it will only work with Windows XP (32 Bit).So far I have only installed it on 32 Bit versions of Windows 7 however I will update this when I get ready to install this on my son's new 64 bit desktop (This is primarlily being done so he can play the new Battlefield 3).**** Updated 11/14/2011 - Just got thru loading this on my son's new desktop running Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 (64 Bit), did not have one problem with the install or running the game afterwards.Here are the Specs of the PC's Me and my son have loaded on so far with success...System Specs: My Sons DesktopIntel Core Dou 2 Quad socket 775, 6mb cache processorIntel DP43TF MOBO8GB of DDR2 800mhz PC6400 RAM750W Antec PSU750GB SATA HDD24bit 5.1 Creative Sound Card1GB intergrated Intel NICATI Radeon HD 6450 PCI-E 1GBWindows 7 Ultimate SP1 (64 Bit)27inch LCD VE276Q ASUS Monitor.System Specs: My Daughter's DesktopP4 3.4GHZ HT socket 478, 1 MB cache processorINTEL 865 PERLK MOBO4GB of DDR1 400mhz PC3200 RAM680W PSU300GB SATA HDD24bit 5.1 Creative Sound CardEdimax Wi-Fi Card1GB intergrated Intel NICATI Radeon HD 3850 AGP 512mbWindows 7 Ultimate SP1 (32 Bit)System Specs: My Son's LaptopDell Inspiron 1720Intel Centrino Core Duo 2 2.4 ghz processor4GB DDR2 Laptop Memory256 mb NVidia 8600m Video Card500GB Boot Drive/ 80GB Data DriveDVD/CD Burner100mb Intergrated Broadcom Nic54mbs Intel WiFi Card17 inch LCD ScreenWindows 7 Professional SP1 (32 Bit)System Specs: My Daughters LaptopDell Inspiron 1545I3 Core 2.53 ghz processor512MB ATI 4650 Video Card4 GB Of DDR3 RAM PC 10666320GB Hard Drive100mb intergrated NIC15.6 inch LCD WidescreenDVD/CD Burner54mbs Intel WiFi CardWindows 7 Professional SP1 (32 Bit)System Specs: My Sons Friends DesktopHP DC 7800 Minitower WorkstationIntel Core Duo 2 Dual Core 2.33ghz processor4 GB DDR2 667mhz PC 5300 RAM256MB Nvidia Quadro FX 1500 Video Card1GB intergrated NIC320GB Hard Drive54mbs USB Wifi CardWindows 7 Professional SP1 (32 Bit)
I love the original Playstation controller, the dual analog, the dual shock, dual shock 2, and dual shock 3 (I wasn't a fan of the Sixaxis only controllers).This one is the best by far! I like the better throw distance on the L2 & R2 buttons, the ridges around the edges of the thumbsticks, the speaker, touchpad, and headset connector! All of that and it's still a comfortable controller to hold!
The controller feels fantastic. The grip is improved, joysticks/buttons are improved, also. There are 2 jacks on the base of the controller. One is for an earpiece/headset and the other says EXT, not sure what that one is for. The only drawback is that in an effort to sell more accessories Sony changed the type of cable. You need to have one of the new cables to use this item with the PS3 as the Bluetooth feature isn't compatible. You need a USB 2.0 A-Male to Micro-B cable to charge and use this one with the PS3.

I like this game especially the new gamebraker and the "off the heazy" and the " Back 2 Papa" technique. It was even better with all the street legends: Earvin Johnson, Larry Bird, James Worthy, Isiah Thomas, Clyde Drexler, Moses Malone, Dominique Wilklins, Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West, David Thompson, Rick Barry, Connie Hawkins, Bill Walton, Julius Erving, Walt Frazier, Earl Monroe, George Gervin, Pete Maravich, Oscar Robertson, Elgin Baylor, Bill Russell, and last but not least Michael Jordan. I give this movie a 5 out of 5.

Somehow I adore this game. There are many well known stars, like DMx, Method Man, Joe Budden and  N.O.R.E. There are also created fighters. These fighters are Sketch, Razor, Chuklez and Nyne. My favourit fighters are Joe Budden and Razor. Razor is 1m 96 tall and he is very strong, so his punches look unreal good. Def Jam Vendetta includes no blood and that's awful. Every fightin'-game should have blood. By the way, I enjoy Def Jam Vendetta and somehow it's amazing.

A year after the out-of-the-blue sucess of Def Jam Vendetta, EA Games releases, Def Jam Fight For NY, with similiar results.  Def Jam Fight For NY is an excellent wrestling game with tons of replay value, and a cool hip-hop influenced storyline to boot.Notice how I referred to the game as a "wrestling" game?  Unlike the game suggests, Def Jam Fight For NY is predominantly a WRESTLING game.  The fighting system is based upon performing grapples and simple strikes, and performing combos and special moves.  With so many moves to choose from and unlock, the fighting system is suprisingly deep, but the fights get just a bit repetitive after a while.Def Jam Fight For NY story mode begins when D-Mob is being taken away by the boys in blue, when suddenly, a mysterious car topples the police cruiser and allows D-Mob to escape.  The driver of the mysterious car, as you soon learn, is you, and you then create the appearance of your character using a police composite sketch, a pretty clever way to create your character.  D-Mob then asks you to join their force of fighters to try and take over the whole fighting circuit of the city.There are over 40 Def Jam labelmates appearing as fighters in the game.  Snoop Dogg, the Top Dogg (naturally) of the opposing gang, with Busta Rhymes, Fat Joe and many others on his side, while your crew consists of the likes of Method Man, Redman and a few others.  As the story progresses and you win fights, you can earn cash to spend on new clothes for your character, supplied by urban name-brands like Sean John, State Property, Joker, Enyce, and Ecko to name a few, new hairstyles for you character, tattoos, shoes, and many other accessories for you character to rock, and of course, there are many others to unlock as you progress through the story.The story mode is long and deep, with a compelling story complete with story twists, and takes a lengthy 8 hours of play to complete.  Of course, once you beat the story mode, you'll be coming back for more.  As usual, there are many hip-hop tunes included in the game, courtesy of Def Jam of course, and multiplayer action is also included.  Fans of wrestling, wrestling games, or hip-hop would find this game very appealing.

As usual, there are many hip-hop tunes included in the game, courtesy of Def Jam of course, and multiplayer action is also included.  Fans of wrestling, wrestling games, or hip-hop would find this game very appealing.
A year after the out-of-the-blue sucess of Def Jam Vendetta, EA Games releases, Def Jam Fight For NY, with similiar results. Def Jam Fight For NY is an excellent wrestling game with tons of replay value, and a cool hip-hop influenced storyline to boot.Notice how I referred to the game as a "wrestling" game? Unlike the game suggests, Def Jam Fight For NY is predominantly a WRESTLING game. The fighting system is based upon performing grapples and simple strikes, and performing combos and special moves. With so many moves to choose from and unlock, the fighting system is suprisingly deep, but the fights get just a bit repetitive after a while.Def Jam Fight For NY story mode begins when D-Mob is being taken away by the boys in blue, when suddenly, a mysterious car topples the police cruiser and allows D-Mob to escape. The driver of the mysterious car, as you soon learn, is you, and you then create the appearance of your character using a police composite sketch, a pretty clever way to create your character. D-Mob then asks you to join their force of fighters to try and take over the whole fighting circuit of the city.There are over 40 Def Jam labelmates appearing as fighters in the game. Snoop Dogg, the Top Dogg (naturally) of the opposing gang, with Busta Rhymes, Fat Joe and many others on his side, while your crew consists of the likes of Method Man, Redman and a few others.

I've been into videogames since Night Driver.  Grand Turismo 4 is the best racecar game in existence.  It is also the finest specimen of graphic achievement on the PlayStation 2.  The entire system works.  The game is meant for the most capable recent home video systems.  Put the game in, turn on the high def television, turn up the surround sound, and you'll be hooked from the moment you see the green light.The game has a complete sound system work-up, meaning Dolby Surround (II) audio.  The rear speakers activate when a car is behind you.  The ambient sound in the game is great.  You can completely control over four hours of music tracks.  You can also control the volume levels of the ambience, the engine noise, and the CD music.  The music has a complete variety including rock to rap, techno to classical.  You make the playlist.  You can make a seperate playlist for a photo show.The visuals are awesome.  The game runs in high def widescreen at  1080-interlaced, plain anamorphic widescreen, or the NTSC 4:3.  This is a beautiful game.  The in-game menu has picture adjustment controls to get the right look for each viewer's video rig including contrast, brightness, and more, and you can multiply that by two because there are two full sets of controls, one for while driving and another one for the replay.  The landscapes of the raceway circuits in this game will have you gaping in awe.  You get the sensation of speed by the high frame rate and the landscape model artwork.This is the best Grand Turismo ever.  This game puts the entire race spectrum, of all backgrounds, into the pot and layers music to it, and that's in the metaphoric sense of music.  You can prefer Formula, LeMans, Rally, Indy Cart, or NASCAR.  You can prefer trucks, SUVs, old V8s, stationwagons, 2-seater spyders, or cars less than 3400mm in length.  You can prefer superchargers, turbos, or naturally-aspirated vehicles.  You can prefer hardtops, softtops, no tops or moon roofs.  You can prefer 2-doors, 3-doors, 4-doors, or 5-doors.  You can prefer 4, 6, 8, or 12 cylinders.  You can prefer 3 speeds, 4 speeds, 5 speeds, 6 speeds, or 1-speeds.  You can prefer extra soft tires, extra hard tires, stock tires, sport tires, race tires, dirt tires, or snow tires.  You can prefer rear-engine, mid-engine, or front-engine.  You can prefer front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive, or all-wheel drive. You can prefer gasoline engines, diesel engines, electric engines, or engines by hand crank.  You can prefer a circuit that has 30-second laps or 10-minute laps.  You can prefer oval tracks, mountainous tracks, forest tracks, city tracks, or circuit tracks.  You can prefer tracks that really exist or tracks that do not exist, daytime or nighttime, and from a pace car or from a starting grid.  You can prefer tarmac tracks, stone tracks, dirt tracks, or snow tracks.  You can drive an autobahn in Germany, or let your team drive.  You can prefer stock cars, race cars, touring cars, rally cars, or street cars.  You can prefer American cars, British cars, German cars, Swedish cars, French cars, Italian cars, Australian cars, Belgian cars, or Japanese cars.This game truly has everything, and you get to manage a pit crew.GT4 is the best Turismo game because it perfects its gaming system and neglects any slight flaw of previous Turismos.  The ONLY part I missed was Turismo 3's masterful introduction video microscopically touring the inside of an engine to Lenny Kravitz rock music, because it amazes me every time, whereas GT4's intro vid rather promotes it's new photo gimmick: I like the gimmick, but the vid's not as artistic as GT3, even if the Van Halen song's nice.  I have only one recommendation: I like having lap records and track records that state the driver, the car, and the record time, which was best done in the first Turismo.One more thing, the graphics are done so well, I can tell that each vehicle has a different camera perspective in its distance from the ground.  For instance, when driving in an SUV, your seated position should be much higher than, let's say, a Formula 1 Ferarri; and in this game, each car's "ride height" is different.  I read a negative comment the person can't judge distance very well in this game.  (He owns an X-Box.)  I sympathize because I have the same trouble; BUT, from a real F1 Ferarri, the driver sits so close to the ground and drives so fast, it's impossible not to have to use landmarks!  NO ONE CAN SEE A TURN WHOSE EYE-LEVEL IS ABOUT 2 FEET OFF THE GROUND.  This is one of the smarter features GT4 provides.  GT4 has, to me, a very credible sense of speed!

What do I look for in a car game? Speed, room for error, exhilaration and cars - lots of them. There have been many great Driving games this year but the one that really does put you back in your seat is NFS RC. The tracks  and cars are radiant and the different modes of play give enough lasting  appeal. Career mode and car damage are improvements over NFS3 but there  could have been more tracks buts thats being picky. Want a laugh? Midtown  madness. Want Rally? Colin Mcrae. Want Touring? Toca 2. If ever you need to  get in your Ferrari on a Sunday afternoon and go 200Mph down a county lane  you wont find a better sim then this. Adrenalin rush for the fastest drive  of your life.

This game has truly photo-realistic graphics and additionally, the replays of the areas are incredible.  The game even permits one to save replays.  The cars in this game are absolutely incredible, and unlike other games, you are not limited to some specific models with similar designs.  Additionally, the selection of cars is absolutely phenomenol.  My best cars for this game are the Jaguar XJ220, the GT-ONE Road Car, the infamous rally car Suzuki Escudo Pikes Peak Version and the Corvette C-5R.  My favorite car, however, has to be the 2000 Beetle Cup, but the handling is clumsy and sometimes forced, like a Beetle.  The scenery is incredible!  I absolutely love the Tokyo tracks and the Rome track for the views of the city.  I additionally love the rally tracks around Tahiti and the wet tracks of Tokyo.  The last note for this game is the game becomes very difficult on the Professional Level.  For example, on the Red Emblem level, you are forced to drive a ROAD car, and you are forced to compete against six other RACE cars (in other words, much better and faster cars than yours). One of the major disappointments for this game is that there is no crash damage, like NASCAR Thunder, Sprint Cars: World of Outlaws or the incoming Pro Race Driver.  The second and last disappointment is that in mutiplayer, especially two-player, one doesn't face computer cars as well, as in NASCAR Thunder.  However, Codemasters' Pro Race Driver may resolve that issue.  Other than that, buy this game if you are a racing freak or just a freak!

I am really enjoying Shift and recommend it, especially to Gran Turismo fans.  I feel this is a good alternative to the really high priced Gran Turismo 5.  Gran Turismo may have way more content such as more tracks and cars and car customizing options, but Shift has all that to some extent, although to a lesser degree, and is way cheaper.  I have been a fan of racing games for years and have played everything ranging from Gran Turismo 1-4 to Grid, Blur, and the NFS titles.  I also have a good mix of dirt racing in there as well.  Shift is a worthy purchase until GT5 reduces in price.Sound: Excellent engine sounds, but NFS has always had great engine sounds.Graphics: Great both inside the car(cockpit view) and out(chase cam).Gameplay: A little touchy to drive but not uncontrollable.Car Selection:  Anything from like a Chevy Cobalt to Pagoni ZondaCustomizing Options:  paint jobs, tuning upgrades(including NOS), visual upgrades
EA brings out NFSU2 at the same time as Burnout 3 which is like releasing CounterStrike1.2 and CounterStrike Source at the same time. NFSU2 players will find themselves in that whole but NFSU2 has real cars, real physics, real world detail, and don't crash perfectly because the real car manufacturers don't want to show us that while fans of Burnout 3 will say, okay if that it what you want but I prefer MORE SPEED and the crash control physics where you can spin your car in slow motion, win more points via damages and then burn off at speeds of over 250mph.Burnout 3 really does it in aces. The start screen says here is car, learn the rules about scoring boost points by dodging traffic, earn extra cars by causing more damage, use slow motion to crash control your car while in the lead to inflict mass damage on the five opponents trailing behind. Then when you win just keep pressing X, see the menu screen, new country open, new race, new car, X again, Vroooooooooom... SMASH... do it all over again till the cows come home.Nothing more to say than outside of Driver 3 or GTA San Andreas, this is best car smash simulator that has the speed over all the others. God it is fun.Pros. Simply smashing.. Faster than NFSU2.. Slow motion crash control physics.. Great tracks and realistic traffic.. New gameplay and scoring.. Not in the least bit like Burnout 1 or 2.. Tons of multiplayer and single player variations.Cons. Burnout 1 and 2 may turn people off this one. It should not though.. No free riding.. Realism pretty much goes out the window with this concept.

System on which this was tried out: Pentium III 733 MHz, nVidia TNT 2 Pro, 128 MB RAM, Win98, with a monitor with 1024 x 768 resolution. My review is of the US version for PCs.The narrator for help prompts and cutscenes is Jim Dale, who also narrates the U.S. unabridged recordings of the books, as well as the extra features on the U.S. DVD of HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE. (I gather that Stephen Fry, Dale's counterpart for the UK editions, narrates the UK version.) All dialogue in the game is accompanied by subtitles, which were apparently written for the UK version and not revised for the US version, although this is rarely apparent.The animation has the same look and feel as EA Games' HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE, with upgrades. The character animation has been improved, so that the characters appear to breathe and blink, and their mouths move as they speak. Combat with creatures such as Peeves is *much* less dependent on Nintendo-like skills, and learning spells isn't so dependent on one's drawing ability (both of which are a relief from *my* point of view).Continuity between sections of the game has greatly improved over STONE. The player can enter some areas before having the ability to use the spells that will provide access to all the items there. For example, a sharp-eyed player who explores the grounds immediately around the castle upon arrival will find at least three areas that he/she cannot reach before learning more spells: Spongify is necessary to use the Spongify pads (marked with spring symbols), and Diffindo is needed to cut through vines and spiderwebs. (Harry used Diffindo on Cedric's bookbag in GOBLET OF FIRE.)A bean trading system has been introduced to allow purchases of items of interest, from brooms to wizard cards. The wizard trading cards now act as access keys to some new areas. The game tracks House points, and periodically awards the House in the lead with an opportunity to collect free beans (motivating the player to get a decent score on the various teachers' test areas, which can be replayed to try to beat one's best time or collect any items missed on an earlier pass).Still has the savebook saving system, so if the player messes up, it can be a long haul from the last save point.After a toy 'rescue Ron from the Whomping Willow' mission, the game mainly consists of two kinds of events:(1) go to the next lesson, learn a new spell, and play through that professor's challenge (essentially an obstacle course that requires mastery of the new spell to complete, and which contains some number of secrets);(2) one-shot quests that cannot be replayed but are essential to the main plot (such as getting the ingredients to make Polyjuice Potion and sneaking into the Slytherin dormitories).Each challenge/quest contains various hidden wizard cards. The player must collect 40 silver cards in the game to enter the special gold wizard challenge area at the end of the game.Bugs: after facing the final challenge, the player is given a chance to wander the grounds and tie up any loose ends before the House Cup award ceremony that ends the game. If you attempt to replay any of the teachers' challenges at that point, the game *will* crash, although if you replay them at any time *before* entering the Forbidden Forest, you shouldn't have problems. Consequently, make sure you collect all Wizard Trading Cards from the Challenge areas *before* the endgame. (The card-buying system provides a margin for error if one can't find all the cards in the one-shot quests, but only if you've been diligent about acquiring beans to pay for them.)
System on which this was tried out: Pentium III 733 MHz, nVidia TNT 2 Pro, 128 MB RAM, Win98, with a monitor with 1024 x 768 resolution. My review is of the US version for PCs.The narrator for help prompts and cutscenes is Jim Dale, who also narrates the U.S. unabridged recordings of the books, as well as the extra features on the U.S. DVD of HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE. (I gather that Stephen Fry, Dale's counterpart for the UK editions, narrates the UK version.) All dialogue in the game is accompanied by subtitles, which were apparently written for the UK version and not revised for the US version, although this is rarely apparent.The animation has the same look and feel as EA Games' HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE, with upgrades. The character animation has been improved, so that the characters appear to breathe and blink, and their mouths move as they speak. Combat with creatures such as Peeves is *much* less dependent on Nintendo-like skills, and learning spells isn't so dependent on one's drawing ability (both of which are a relief from *my* point of view).Continuity between sections of the game has greatly improved over STONE. The player can enter some areas before having the ability to use the spells that will provide access to all the items there. For example, a sharp-eyed player who explores the grounds immediately around the castle upon arrival will find at least three areas that he/she cannot reach before learning more spells: Spongify is necessary to use the Spongify pads (marked with spring symbols), and Diffindo is needed to cut through vines and spiderwebs.

This is going to sound strange, but I don't think I've ever enjoyed playing a game as much as I enjoyed playing this one.  I thought Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was a great game, but Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a hundred times better.  Almost all of the minor issues I had with the first game were addressed more than adequately, and I have been all but addicted to this game since the day I got it.  This is not some cheap game thrown out there to make money off of Pottermania; it is challenging, it is exciting, and it is absolutely addictive.  Harry Potter's world really comes alive here.  You start out at home on Privet Drive, visit Diagon Alley to get your school supplies, and fly right onto campus, into the clutches of the Whomping Willow tree, in Mr. Weasley's flying Ford Anglia.  From that point on, you are immersed in the Hogwarts experience.  The opening action is done quite well; while there is no tutorial per se, the game walks you through the opening scene, reminding you how to use the spells you learned during your first year at Hogwarts.  At that point, you are ready to experience the events of Harry's second year from the first day of class with Professor Lockhart to the concluding House Points ceremony at year end.  The cut scenes from the first game are gone, letting you see and experience every event, and the game is by and large simply beautiful.  There is more interaction with the teachers this year, there are almost limitless nooks and crannies of the campus to investigate, and not only are there enough challenges to satisfy just about everyone, the challenges can all be completed successfully by even the youngest of Potter fans.  If I can finish a game without resorting to a cheat or two along the way, then I know everyone else in the world can do it.There are some rather significant changes from the first Harry Potter game.  First and foremost is the ability to now skip through cut scenes; I did a lot of the challenges several times in order to accrue as many House Points as possible, and it was wonderful to be able to skip right past the opening scenes each time.  The way you learn spells has also undergone a radical change; I prefer the old way, but this new method probably makes things easier for younger players.  Speaking of something being easier, the Quidditch matches (and there are six of them, each of which you can replay as many times as you like) are radically different.  The first game's Quidditch play was fun, but at times I thought I would never be able to grab the Snitch.  In this game, Harry automatically follows the Snitch, making for much shorter matches.  The fun part here, though, is the fact that you must battle your opposing Seeker; this means that you get to kick and punch the other player around, a most satisfying experience when you are going up against Slytherin and their new Seeker Draco Malfoy.  The championship match even takes you underneath the trenches, trying to dodge wooden beams while giving Draco the business.  Another great addition to this game is wizard dueling.  Not only is it great fun to duel your classmates, it provides an easy way for you to increase your supply of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.  These beans serve as the method of exchange on campus, and with them you can buy all sorts of wonderful things, from a Nimbus 2001 to Flobberworm Mucous to wizard cards.  Wizard cards are important, and they, like the beans, can be found all over Hogwarts.  There are fifty bronze wizard cards to collect, and each tenth card you find provides you with an additional stamina level.  If you find all forty silver wizard cards, you get access to a special room.  Even if you complete all your tasks, you will want to find or buy enough silver wizard cards to gain entrance to this room because here a final challenge awaits you, promising eleven gold wizard cards of the most important wizards in the world (guess who number eleven is?).Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets also makes it easy to maintain your health (although falling into pits, which I frequently did, pretty much turns you into the boy who didn't live); you can locate and/or buy Flobberworm Mucous and Wiggentree Bark, the essential ingredients needed to concoct Wiggenweld Potion.  This potion restores stamina, and my best advice to the future player is to acquire as much of this healing potion as you can before taking on the basilisk.  You can win beans by dueling, so any time you find yourself in need of more funds, just zip down to the Great Hall and show your opponents what you are made of.  I was woefully unprepared for my first two confrontations with the basilisk, but I actually didn't mind because it gave me an excuse to start a new game and do everything again.  It takes longer than you might think to actually complete Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, and I have no thoughts of putting this game away now.  It is as much fun to play the second or third time through as it is the first.

I'm not a gigantic Harry Potter maniac ...but I must say the game is good. The 3d graphics are very impressive, good music and easy-to-remember-controls: ctrl, alt, and arrow keys. But the end of the game is sort of shocking; the end shows Harry in the Great Hall with lots of other people clapping, and then the credits start rolling. And you think, "Oh. It's over." And then you just sit there and stare at the screen.But the game is SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE. The mouths move, Harry automaticlly follows the Snitch, the spells are easier to learn and there is more of Hogwarts to explore.You can also use your beans once you find them. You can trade them for cool stuff. The characters are humorus and fit in with the game. But Snape wasn't mean at all. He was actually helping Harry make a Wiggenweld potion.The spiders were awesome. The Aragog level was fun, too(I was the only one brave enough to do that level; my brothers and my mom were hiding in the kitchen)and a little hard.There are more spells to learn too. But good ol' Flipendo is still alive and kickn'. But in the first game you used Flipendo ALL THE TIME. You even used it to defeat Voldemort(and it's supposed to be a FLIPPING spell!). But now you use Ritusempra, Diffindo, Skurge and Spongify(a REALLY fun spell!!!).Hermione isn't folding her arms all the time in this game. It was really annoying in the first game. Ron is funnier and they wait for you when they are leading you somewhere(instead of letting you get lost in the castle).This is great game. Get it!!!

I got this game after I played the Gamecube version and this one is alot better.Pros-.quidich better than the first game.creative spells.the bean bonus room(if you have the most house points you get to in a room to collect bertie botts beans which you can use as curency).you can redo challenges.there is more challenges in the Chamber of Secrets. In the NGC one when you enter the chamber you fight the heir without going through some challengesCons-.the Nimbus 2001 cant do anything.there is a time limit in spell challenges and there realy is no point because I can get them done in a quick amount of time.a little too easy.No transfigeration class.graphics could be a little better but it sure a whole lot better than the 1st game

Hello!, first of all let me tel you that I am a big fan of the sports games, especialy basketball games. For me, this is a good game, whit good graphics and animations.The only complaint I find is that is very easy to score in some levels. In rokie I have to put the time of the quarter in 6 minutes, because in the 12 minutes period i score almost 200 points whit every team. For me is not very dificult to score in the beginers levels, but what a change when you play in the all-star level, you can easly lose a game for almost 25 points, even if you play against the weaker team.GRAPHICS.- Are very good, with excelent presentacion of the local team, almos as  the one you look at the T.V. The detail on the players are very good, including tatoes an facial expressions. The people on the bench also move and you can so them talk with each other. Te coachs walk and sometimes move his hands. In the All Star game, the ligths are excelent, the presentation of the players is verry good. The only complaint is whit the spectators, they look so woody, and only jump.CONTROLS.- In this game you can put a key if you want to shoot, another if you want to dunk, another if you want to pass, another if you wanto to throw and alley hoop, another if you wanto to jump. Almost all of the action you saw in a game is here.SOUND.- The sound is very good, you can hera the coments of the players, the instruccions of your coach, the cheears os the sepectators, and also the way the ball hits the basket in a dunk.In all, this is a very good game, if you like basketball, this game is pure fun, enyoy the game.

I have to go with ESPN this year for baseketball, by a smidgen. This game is basically average in every aspect. The graphics are average, the gameplay is average and the player rating system is just horrible. The real reason I ever play this game is for the slam dunk contest. It is a lot of fun and it is very addicting. The three point contest is a lot of fun too. I'd say this game is worth renting and now that the price has been lowered maybe buying, for the all star weekend mode alone. Here is how I rate this game.graphics: 75Player Rating system: 40gameplay: 70Dunk contest: 100three point contest: 95rookie challenge: 80commentary: 85freestyle control: 90overall: 85Espn barely beats it this year.

My jaws sunk low, self-emitting air filed around me, and stupidly I gawked at my PC screen. Since when did a game rekindle my fancy for the first form of literature I warmly embraced? Anime, at times, is juiced up with vague or unnecessary talk with global weight on crushing action, but comic books have grown as a nippy alternative to time-consuming novels with marvelously penciled scenes. Where comics like the dormant Battle Chasers and, all-time favorite, Spawn attenuated my reading and visual proclivity, Freedom Force successfully lands on the video game populace in style. Full of tantalization, the game rips a new outfit on the grounds of gaming. I haven't experienced this kind of cunning direction, ever. Irrational Games assembles a flat-out ambiance which thrusts players into thrilling heroism. The RPG/Strategy affiliation shreds awesome gameplay components. Every description in the game is an indication that the company was rapt on fashioning a game based on the comic book medium. Freedom Force takes in all the legacy and stereotypes of the 60's Silver Age, and on the videogame scale, it rumbles.Sweaty-palm action awaits as soon as you decide who to take from a pool of heroes. After selecting four members, you then jump onto the fray and gain following missions. More often than not, your elite band of defenders must put an end to rampaging supervillains along with their loyal minions. Reasonably linear, the lion's share of Freedom Force is the mastered mechanics, and the ironic yet interesting cost of being violent superheroes. Remember anime (or even Power Puff Girls) where the forces of good take it on the open streets, disregarding the safety of structures, and bulldoze it down? As Uncle Ben once said from Spidey comics, "with great power comes even greater responsibility." Ditto, here. Pedestrians mind their walks of life, cars burn rubber, and in the center, a heated clash between the forces of good and evil. Oh, dear! Oh, my! Being reckless may trigger unwanted wreckage of the city that is supposedly under your protection. Depending on your choice of attacks, Patriot City can be decimated to rubble. Strategic usage of the environment (i.e. lifting cars as projectiles) should be limited due to the sensitivity of the backgrounds. From caving buildings to impersonating Babe Ruth with traffic polls, needless destruction is booed.Devilish destruction reduces the bag of important Prestige Points. Awarded after victory, these points are applied to attain additional heroes. EXP points are also given to prime a hero's abilities or expand them. As an incentive to minimize running amok, if you fail to wisely handpick a fit squad, future supervillains will squash your band of heroes into [mush]. Ample with whirls of Real-Time frenzy, a tide of excellent RPG elements, and the aim to prevent harm on Patriot city, Freedom Force is smart as it is witty.Totally smitten with Freedom Force, it hurts to divulge the minimal frowns upon it. In fact, the game gets terribly hectic without any sign of slowing down. Selecting commands may provide golden opportunities for curt surprises from concealed enemies. Failing to detect them means your good guys go down and dead. Without radar or even a teeny map, studying your surroundings seems like a tactical joy, but the constant, overbearing work is strain for the eyes. Trust me, if you thought 4 heroes is depressing petty, it's enough with the brutal and lighting-quick square offs. Also, no automatic pausing is a pain. Frequent instances of tongue-lashing conforms with the in-game chaos. Even so, the robust personality of Freedom Force dwarfs the potholes floating around it. However, far from perfect, there is nothing quite like this and is the closest thing to match a child's interactive role in a comic book.The hero cast is intentionally cheesy as the Super Friends. Stereotypes of the 60's comics (corny dialogue) forges together and packs a full press of eccentricity. Merciless creatures alternatively keep the 90's evil-doer persona unbroken. Expect the trademark of what Marvel Comics originally gave rise to. Where DC presented the typical "superhero stops supervillain," Marvel effectively introduced a new prospective and presented the personal life of its characters. Freedom Force excels on it too. Character growth was nice to witness, but the cast is so overpopulated that various characters are overshadowed by the stars. Cheesy hallmarks and naturally droll, the clowning occasions in Freedom Force deserves recognition.Voice-overs are gallant, funny, and when called for, somber. Excellent themes manage to merge an exclusive fusion of topnotch sound quality while comic-looking graphics that are so colorfully caustic it'll have your gums bleed. Once a "FOOSH," slashed across the screen, I was tickled by my comic book sensibilities. Characters are fleshed out with exaggerated, superhero costumes and work well with the polygonal construction. The interactive 3D environment and superhero powers are very cool to watch when toyed with. The option to tailor the camera view is welcomed, especially when seconds of disorder surface. The thick quality behind every inch of comic book design has me fighting back tears."Sniff, it's beautiful man. Just beautiful."Vast in the digit of powers and tactics, the single-player is an experience of immersive frolic. Many people responded with a confounded, "huh," when I asked if they knew the existence of Freedom Force. Can anyone say, "sleeper hit." Hallmarks of the game siphons reality, and lets the boyish imaginings to roam free and putter with the infectious bounties of the game. Logging hours on the extensive single-player, the chance to shape your own characters, appearance, powers, and pick out an assortment of Marvel and DC skins, will have you brewing cup after cup of coffee. Now, to shut these blood-shot eyes. . .

Uncharted 2: Among Thieves' plot revolves around the doomed voyage home of Marco Polo from China in 1292. After spending almost 20 years in the court of the Mongol Emperor Kublai Khan, Marco Polo departed with fourteen ships and over six hundred passengers - but when he arrived in Persia a year and a half later, only one ship and eighteen passengers remained. Polo never revealed what had happened to the lost ships. Embarking on a quest to find the lost fleet, Nathan Drake soon realizes that Marco Polo was hiding a much bigger secret. That he had gone on a secret expedition to find the mythical kingdom of Shambhala and to recover the legendary Cintamani Stone, or the "Wish-fulfilling jewel" of Buddhist mythology as its' called. With this information, Nathan decides on a new course by following Marco Polo's trail. This quest pits him against a more formidable adversary than he is used to - a ruthless, rogue paramilitary leader with a private army and an ambition to recover the stone from Nathan for himself.Even though I played the first game and liked it, I never loved it. It seemed way too  much like Tomb Raider to me. I know I'll probably take some flack for saying that but it did to me. However, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves changed all that. This time around, I was more engrossed in the story and felt like I had accomplished something when I finished the game. The story came to a satisfying conclusion and, literally, made me start on the third game almost immediately. It truly is an amazing game that deserves all the awards and praise that it gets. Not only does it push the envelope graphically but in all other aspects as well. I'll go so far as to agree with other reviewers here that you will NOT regret purchasing this game. Playing this game made me a fan of the franchise.On a footnote, I think I might go back and play the first game again and see if my view on that game will change. I'm pretty sure it will. Give it a look, gamers...Uncharted 2: Among Thieves by Naughty Dog is one of the Best games of this generation of games on PS3. Buy It!
I am going to discuss the Collector's Edition, NOT the game.Uncharted 3 Collector's edition contains wearable replicas from the game itself such as a ring/key from Marco Polo with the words Sic Parvis Magna [greatness from small beginnings]. The Collector's Edition also includes a mini statuette of Nathan Drake himself and, of course, the Uncharted 3 game in a tin case that has more show than most other casings I have seen so far. All of this comes in a traveling case which looks like a rather nice looking cabinet.Our son who got it as a Christmas present is very pleased with what he received. The ring with the inscribed words Sic Parvis Magna is a constant source of inspiration for him, or so he says. The figurine of Nathan Drake has been done very well to look like he is staring into the distance, ready for the task ahead. Can't say that the face looks a lot like Nathan Drake, however his spirit seems to have been captured in it. The belt buckle that also comes with the case may not be everybody's thing but it still looks nice and would a decent gift for a friend that may like one.After you are finished taking out all of these contents you are still left with the container which they came in. You don't have to throw it away or dust off some old shelf for it; it makes a very good container for storing things and if you really want to, a decent decoration.Could not have asked for anything more from the Collector's Edition of Uncharted 3.
From the treks through steamy jungles to the endless wisecracks, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves has a lot in common with its 2007 predecessor. You're still controlling the rugged everyman Nathan Drake in an Indiana Jones-inspired adventure, and he hasn't learned many moves since his first outing. But while the sequel may sound by-the-books on paper, the actual results are astonishing. While the original was competent and easy on the eyes, Uncharted 2 is a game that should sell consoles. I cannot believe how well the final project came together.Uncharted 2 wastes no time throwing you into the action, as Nathan awakens in a wrecked train dangling from the Himalayan cliff. After a harrowing climb back onto the snowy ground, the game flashes back to a tropical beach. Here, he and new "friends" Chloe and Flynn discuss how to steal a lamp that may hold Marco Polo's secret directions to Shangri La. From this initial meeting, you'll be struck by how well-written and delivered the dialogue is. Not that the first game was a dramatic slouch, but because you're more familiar with Nathan and company, their actions have much more resonance.After the beach rendezvous, Uncharted 2 whisks you away to Nepal, where you'll explore temples, a mountain village, a militarized city and a heavily armed train. The level variety puts the original to shame, as if Naughty Dog was trying to address a complaint nobody even had in the first place. And more impressive, every inch of the additional real estate is populated with tons of furniture, fauna and other assorted knickknacks. Though it's hard to stop to look at the rooftops when a missile-launching helicopter is pursuing you, a quick glance at the Nepali skyline will astound with its level of detail.The presentation has received the biggest boost, but there have been subtle improvements to the combat as well. Melee combos are much more forgiving, so that you can mostly get away with mashing the punch button instead of needing split-second timing. Enemies also absorb fewer bullets than before and are now susceptible to stealthy attacks from behind. The sneakier options and smoother controls mean that combat zones suddenly become Nathan's playgrounds, letting you pick and choose how you want to dispose of your enemies.Unfortunately, while Nathan's fighting skills have improved, I do wish there were more footholds when it's time to climb. To go from a sprawling arena to a single, linear path can be frustrating, especially when this path is obscured by plants and debris. The game always gives you hints if you're stuck, but I think giving the player a few more entry points would have been the way to go.The main adventure's 20-plus chapter journey is riveting. It delivers all of the thrills that we had hoped from Indiana Jones last summer, and Nathan's band of sidekicks exudes warmth that other story-driven games lack. But if video game storytelling isn't your thing, the new multiplayer options may hold your attention for a little while. You have standard death match and capture the flag variants, but the real treat is co-op, where up to three players can team up to score some treasure. I don't think the gunplay is going to lure anyone away from holiday biggies like Halo 3: ODST and Modern Warfare 2, but there's some to be had for casual shooter fans.Even if you never go online, Uncharted 2 arguably offers the most PS3 fun this holiday season. The set pieces are exhilarating, the scenery is gorgeous and the characters play off of each other beautifully. Like Marco Polo in his quest for Shangri La, the industry will release an impressive fleet of games this fall, and only a handful will survive on the shelves. Make sure that Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is one of them.--Reviewed by Justin Hemenway
I enjoyed this game alot but I hate to say this, I prefer Uncharted 2 or Uncharted 1 over the third one. IF i had to rate all three, I would say, Uncharted 2, Uncharted 1 and Uncharted 3. There are some great moments in uncharted 3 but to be honest the game felt rushed since I know naughty dog is working on &#34;the last of us&#34; game.

Choosing among Classical, Reggae, Talk Radio (My Favorite), Pop, Techno, and others, GTA3's radio archives (about 5 hours worth) contributes incalculably to the game's hugely expansive appeal in even more unforeseen ways.Grand Theft Auto 3 is an extraordinarily magnificent cinematic video gaming experience that despite it's ethically controversial content symbolizes everything categorically glorious and superlatively outstanding about the video game forum.Not to be missed for ALL the tea in China.

GTA3 is possibly the best game I have ever played. The incredible amount of crime in the game is rediculous, but hey, it's not like you're REALLY breaking the law, right?Prostitution, drugs, car jacking, murder, theft, evading arrest, more murder, homeless people, and even more murder litter this game like trash in the ghetto. But despite the irresponsible amount of law-breaking in this game, it's got a pretty good story too!You are a nameless escaped convict on the run from the law. You befriend another escaped con, and soon, you're doing low-paying jobs for a mafia nightclub owner. Successfully completing more missions for the man allows you to work your way up the ladder of crime and money.Eventually you make it to other islands, and do missions for other people, thus the story continues. This game has BILLIONS of hours of gameplay, and it's not just mission either. The graphics, controls, story, and most of all, the crime is all awesome. Not suitable for children under 35!

Successfully completing more missions for the man allows you to work your way up the ladder of crime and money.Eventually you make it to other islands, and do missions for other people, thus the story continues. This game has BILLIONS of hours of gameplay, and it's not just mission either. The graphics, controls, story, and most of all, the crime is all awesome. Not suitable for children under 35!
I bought this game last winter when it was still new because everyone was talking about how fun it was.At first, I didn't want to buy it because I really don't like car games.  But I gave it a chance and it ended up as my favorite game of all time.  And really, it isn't all about cars.You take the role of a man who was betrayed by his girlfriend during a bank robery and left to take the blame.  You first start out in "Portland Veiw" where you must go around doing missions for people.  Many of the missions are killing your assigner's enimies.After completeing so many missions in Portland, you move onto a place called Staunton Island.  And after that, Shoreside Vale.The missions aren't plain and boaring, they have a plot and tie in with the story which has many twist, turns, bumps and curves in it.And when you get tired of doing missions, you can just go around, "barrowing" the best of cars and crusing around or just running around around by foot and starting fights.  There are also side missions such as a taxi driver which you have to option of doing after you steal a taxi.  Then there is a police officer type of mission you can do when you have a police car and even a paramedic mission you can do when you have an ambulance in which you pick up injured people and drive them to the hospital in a sertain amount of time.Grand Theft Auto 3 has a lot to offer and is a "must-have" for people who have a Playstation 2.  (Just keep the kiddies away from it)

Wing Commander: Prophecy is without a doubt one of my all-time personal favorite games for the PC. Aside from the fact that it gracefully and heroically retires Christopher Blair (Mark Hammil) from the series, the  game is an expertly crafted piece of entertaining with only a few  (stylistic) flaws. It also improves greatly over Wing Commander IV: The  Price of Freedom by making combat missions longer than the video cut  scenes, something that dogged its predecessor greatly. Prophecy has such  eerie underpinnings that work together with the game and live action  cinematics to make for an awesome story. It is also the start of a new  generation.After the defeat of the Kilrathi by Blair in Wing  Commander III: Heart of the Tiger, the Confederation finally has peace with  regards to their once feline adversaries and the Cult of Sivar. But there  in lies the crux of the matter for an ages old Kilrathi prophecy points to  a time when darkness will descend upon the universe and the Kilrathi will  die, bathed in their own blood and their once mighty claws no match for the  coming evil, a time that they call Kn'Thrak, (A translation that means  either `darkness' or `evil'). And it all begins with the destruction of a  Confederation survey ship analyzing the destroyed Kilrathi homeworld in the  Kilrah System by an unknown race.There Shall Come A timeWhen one who  has the heart of a Kilrathi,but is not Kilrathi born, shall  raincleansing fire down upon us,and Kn'Thrak, a time of great  darkness,shall embrace us.We are then taken to the TCS Midway, a  gargantuan super carrier that will be the focus of the game and your home  base for the duration. It is truly a magnificent ship and about the same  size as Darth Vader's Super Star Destroyer-about 8,000 meters in length. It  acts as a mobile base for the Terran Confederation and designed to be the  center piece of a larger armada. It is here that we meet Lance Casey-your  character-who is fresh from the academy and son of a famous TCN pilot. We  also meet up with old Wing Commander alumnus-Maniac (Tom Wilson) who takes  every opportunity to belittle Casey until getting his comeuppance in the  worst way and by numerous members of the Midway's crew.Basically  it's your job to figure out just who these new aliens are and what they  want. What they apparently want is to slaughter everyone and everything  they come across, which is great because that's why you're here! There are  heaps of missions here and they are all a great deal of fun. Missions range  from standard Combat Air Patrols (CAPs), to seeking out and destroying  capital ships, taking down freighters and search and rescue missions. One  of the most memorable moments of the game is a missile launch, especially  the Swarms, which leave twisting contrails as they streak off towards their  targets. Origin really did a fine job on the new fighter designs-they no  longer have the blocky, slab-like look that Price of Freedom had, but  instead have a more graceful, rounded look. Most of these ships are also a  joy to fly, conveying a great sense of speed and maneuverability, though  less so with bombers like the Devastator.Sid Mead (of 2010 &amp;  Blade Runner fame) was hired on to design the alien Nephilim/Phylum  fighters and capital ships, and produces true wonders! The fighters have a  beautiful aquatic-insectile look to them while the capital class starships  resemble nothing most people have ever seen. They are both fearsome and  invoke no small amount of curiosity from the player and made me want to  find out more about this dark and enigmatic race.Mission designs  seems to have been a priority at Origin, because they are expertly crafted  and bear much resemblance to Freespace 2, and lack the time-sensitive  nature that plagued many of the X-Wing &amp; TIE Fighter missions from  LucasArts. I also retract my title comment in my Freespace 2 review-Wing  Commander: Prophecy is as good a game. The missions take priority over the  cut scenes, the post flight ones become annoyingly repetitive, as there are  only 2 or 3 to see and you see them often. Beyond that this is Origin's  swan song as there doesn't seem to be any movement from them to sequel it  beyond Secret Ops which only adds new missions, good as they are. This is a  fantastic game-it both looks and plays great while possessing a solid and  engrossing story. Superb!

When anyone looks back on 2001, and tries to choose the best game of the year, Grand Theft Auto III is the obvious choice. Not without its fair share of controvesy and complaints from shocked parents, this Mature rated game is just that mature. Children really shouldn't play this at all. Cursing is not as apparent as the scare tactics would have you believe, and when you do shoot someone it is pretty gory, but you usually don't have to. Some of the missions revovle around "working girls" and this can be a cause of concern. If you are mature enough to handle all this you should defineatly buy Grand Theft Auto.It has more to offer then any other game I have ever played. You can play the missions for the mob bosses in pretty well any order you want, or you can steal an ambulance to do the ambulance missions, a firetruck to do the firetruck missions, and a poilce car or a tank to do vigilante missions. If this doesn't tickle your fancy, you can just go around the huge 3-D enviornment of Liberty City and go on your own crime wave. Liberty City is huge and you steal any car that's not tied down and drive till your blue in the face. Very simillar to the gaming experiance on Driver II. Or you go around on foot, like a prototype version of Max Payne. Driver II plus Max Payne equals a great replay value. This game is definatley worth your fifty bucks.There are three huge areas, Portland, where you start out, Staunton Island, then Shoreside Vale. Each area adds some new cars. Cars aren't the only way to travel in Liberty City though, you can go by train, by subway, by boat, plane, and on foot, at different ocassions through this great game, that never gets old. There's really only three buildings you can go into to but the game doesn't lack for anything as a result. You can go into a gun shop called Ammu-Nation, spray shops, and 8-ball's bomb shop. There's seven gangs, a great cast of characters and great writting, with great graphics,sound, and value.A Video Game Website's RatingGameplay- 9Graphics- 9Sound- 10Value- 10Tilt- 10Overall- 9.6SuperbMy RatingGameplay- 9.5Graphics- 9Sound- 10Value- 10Tilt- 10Overall- 9.7SuperbBottom Line: Grand Theft Auto III is the game to own and if you are mature enough to handle it, buy it, you won't be sorry. If you feel you are too weak hearted, rent it first but trust me, the game is the best to come along in years.

This expansion was a lot of fun to play. Nowadays, you can buy it (used) for a few bucks, so the price is right; originally, it was overpriced given the (short) length of game play. Like the original, the graphics are good, the sound effects well done, and the controls are easy to use. It's a quality WWII shooter WITHOUT the blood/gore and foul language that most modern games include. I played single player only. 2.40 is the latest patch for the game. The game runs fine on Windows XP Home SP3. It's a game that I plan to replay in the future.This expansion covers...* the Battle of the Kasserine Pass* the fall of Bizerte* the Battle of Monte Cassino* the amphibious landings and defense of the beachhead at Anzio* the battle of Monte BattagliaInstead of buying this version of the game, I recommend buyingMedal of Honor 10th Anniversary Bundle - PC, which includes:1) Allied Assault2) Spearhead Expansion Pack3) Breakthrough Expansion Pack4) Pacific Assault Director's Edition5) AirborneVisit my Amazon Collections to see my 4-star and 5-star PC games:http://www.amazon.com/gp/customers/A12LH2100CKQO/collections

After buying it for my DS, I disappoint that the only language that handles is English, unlike the The Sims 2 DS that detects the origin of the DS and selects the language in automatic form. I had to sell it in auctions by Internet to buy the version to me of the Gameboy Advanced

PS Vita Travel PouchI bought the vita travel pouch right after I got my vita to help prevent scratches when I take my vita outside or on vacation. You open the pouch with a zipper revealing a piece of fabric in the middle. It divides the case into two sections. You put the vita in one side, I put the screen facing the fabric because it softer. On the other side are two mesh pockets for accessories. On the fabric that divides the case are four slots for vita game cards. The case also has a little hook which a strap can be attached too.The case is very durable and protects the vita perfectly.
The pouch is made out of soft material but has very good interior padding to protect your Vita (front and back).Not sure if this is of importance to anyone but my previous HORI case had a horrible stench that has contaminated my Vita - the fabric on this one smells nice and will help preserve the original new manufactured plastic of your Vita.
I was searching through the booklet and came across the name "David Kaye," I thought I've seen this name before, so I went here to find out more. After searching Metal Gear Solid and finding out that the Ninja is played by Pinky from Pinky and the Brain and that Liquid Snake was Ryudo in Grandia 2, i search this game and there it was: David Kaye as Clark.

This case is roomy, but if you decide to leave just your PS Vita in it alone it still provides great safety.  The case is actually a soft case and not a hard fabric.
A few of the levels in this game aren't medievil,such as the gardens,the observatory,the academy,and the museum.But some such as the tomb,hall,sewer,cathedral are.Perhaps that's the only problem.You can play as DanHand,half head,half hand to get into small passages too.You also go boxing,when Sir Dan's friend,The Professer puts it on a Frankenstein-like body.You can even play without Sir Dan's skull on.And in the tomb you have to solve a puzzle of rescuing the Egyptian princess,Kiya.The main plot is that your favorite skeleton knight is awakened by a mad wizard named Palethorn,with the pages of Zarok,(remember that big chinned dress wearing madman who trapped the mayor,awakened the dead zombies,and tried his best to kill Sir Dan?) So Dan is awakened to attack the awakened dead.This game may be challenging though.And also you know,I suggest you buy the strategy guide.Get this game,it's fun.

I read reviews for several cases but this one seems to fit my needs to a T!  I travel a lot and love bringing along a handheld gaming device.  This case holds the Vita, games and accessories in a soft, cushioned container.  The zippers function smoothly.  Unfortunately, I won't have a PS Vita until the ACIII Liberation bundle is released.11/01/12: Received my ACIII Liberation bundle last night!  Will be trying out the pouch this weekend while I'm out running around.
Holds itself and the content in it well but don't expect it to protect your stuff if you drop it from a height that might break your stuff due to its soft elastic-y material. Best used for convenience as it let you put your vita and accessories in it. For me, I stuck both my Vita and PSP 3k in it and still had a bit of space left for a couple/few mem cards, vita cartridges, and/or PSP UMDs without any of them conflicting each other as there are a couple of nylon-made things separating each section that doesn't take up much space.Very convenient so great product to have.
The Uncharted Series has been a really good series and when Bend Studios announce Uncharted: Golden Abyss for the PS Vita I decided its a most buy. Putting the game into my PS Vita and starting the game noticing a big difference of graphics from a regular PSP game from a PS Vita game. Just Like most all Sony games they push the system and utilizes all its features. Uncharted Golden Abyss does that.Controls:Uncharted: Golden Abyss uses all the features that the PS Vita has to offer. From the two analog sticks to the touch pad in the back and touch screen in the front. UC:GA plays just like any other UC:GA games but with added features. I find this a big Plus since it made the game more fun and challenging. The controls are little awkward at first since the PS Vita is bigger than a normal PS3 controller. The touch screen is use when need to throw a grenade or to dust of artifacts for clues. Also when getting close quarter combat the player most swipe his finger on the direction the game tells the player to swipe. When climbing the player could also use the touch screen to guide Nathan to climb with a single touch. The Rear Pad is used to climb a robe or to rotate an artifacts. UC:GA also uses the PS Vita's Motion Sensing to take pictures and other stuff. After awhile the player will get use to the controllers.Graphics:Uncharted series is well know for its graphics. Just like any other uncharted games. Uncharted Golden Abyss have the best Graphics so far on the PS Vita. The beauty of the game makes this game so good for a handheld game. the PS Vita is the closes you will get to a PS3 game and Uncharted Golden Abyss is the one that shows it. With some minor Screen tearing Uncharted does everything good on the Graphics.Sound:Uncharted: Golden Abyss have some amazing music. The Sounds Effects of the guns and explosions are the same as the ps3. The voice acting is perfect. Dont have much to talk about graphics.Story:Nathan is on another mission to solve a 400 year old massacre of a spanish expedition. With his old friend Jason and Marisa. Jason back stabs and leaves Nathan and Marisa to find the true about what happen 400 years ago and to find out what happen to Marisa's Grandpa. As the story goes Nathan goes to the extreme and with cinematic driller cut scenes and situations will keep the player entertain.Overall:Overall Uncharted: Golden Abyss is just like the other Uncharted games but portable. The graphics and sounds are there and the gameplay is the same. the story will keep you want to play more. It takes a good amount of hours to past this game and for added challenges one could go back and find all the artifacts and pictures. I will recommend this game to everyone who has a PS Vita and who love the uncharted series. this game could be the reason you want to buy a PS Vita.

I am the biggest hardcore player on SOCOM II. Online as of May 32st 2005, I have about 6100 Kills and 3500 Deaths. I am not just a hardcore fan, I am also pretty good. Now, there are many many things in this game to go over, and I couldn't possibly do it all. First off, do not bother getting this game to try the offline expierience.. it's well not worth it. With that out of the way, let me get down with the online play. Here are the POPULAR levels, my ratings, and how they stack up to me.( I most likely will not remember them all.. sorry. :( )OLD LEVELS:Frostfire: 10/10 : This level takes place on a very large ship, and it's at night time, but it is not that dark. The main thing I love about this map is how it is all flat, allowing for quick kills, and a lot of fun. A main feature about this level though is probably the tunnels, in where the Terrorists normally ' Camp ' from the SEALs with a shotgun and wait for them to come down. This level is different from the old version simply because the tunnels are connected. This is BYFAR my favorite map of SOCOM and SOCOM II. It is also one of the most popular SOCOM II maps. ( Most likely #3 ) Advantage: Most Likely TerroristsDESERT GLORY: 9/10: In this level, the SEALs must extract the hostages from their cells while the terrorists try and protect them. The title of the level is basically what the level is like. A very desolent level with a lot of sand and run down buildings. There are buildings to camp out in, stuff to hide behind, and it's just a great. This is also a very popular online map. ( Most likely #2 )Advantage: Probably TerroristsNIGHT STAKLER: 6/10: To many people, this reminds them of DESERT GLORY at night. But to me, I see it as a much different level. Though similar in design, this one is in mid-night ( so its not too dark ) and instead of extracting hostages, you have to plant a bomb. This level is similar to DESERT GLORY in some ways, but this level is bigger ( i think ) and not as fun. ( there are too many sniper positions.. it's almsost impossible to hide from them! ) This map, AS WELL is also a rather popular online map. ( Probably about #6 ) Advantage: Possibly the SEALsNEW LEVELS:CROSS ROADS: 8/10: This is the first level I played for SOCOM II online. This is litterally ALWAYS full of people in the public rooms, and is very, very popular. This level has the SEALs starting at one corner and the Terrorists starting at the other. You have to find the bomb and plant it at the opposing base. This level reminds me of a fancy middle-east market place for some reason. This level is pretty average to me, thogh. This one like i said is EXTREMELY popular. ( Definitely #1 ) Advantage: None, in ' Clan Wars ' this is normally the tie-breaker.There is many more maps, but those are just a few. I will now goto the guns ( I will try to list them all )SEALS:M4A1: 10/10: Great gun. Shoots fast, accurateM4A1SD: 10/10: Great gun. Shoots accurately, good for headshots, silencedRA-14: 9/10: Not bad of a gun. Accurate, takes off heavy damage.IW-80 A2: 10/10: Should be used by ' noobies ' very good accuracy, very good shooting, but considered a ' ***** gun 'AK-105: 8/10: Not too bad. Similar to the RA-14 but shoots slower.HK5: 6/10: Only good if you are good at getting headshots.HK5SD: 7/10: Only good for getting headshots, accurate.HK5K: 7/10: Horrible accuracy, but fast shooting, so almost a guarenteed kill.12 GAUGE PUMP: 4/10: Useless unless in tunnels on Frostfire!TERRORISTS:AK-47: 6/10: Not very good. Bad accuracy, not very good overall.AKS-74: 6/10: Similar to the AK-47.STG-77: 8/10: Similar to the SEALs HK5K , to me. Good for headshots.552: 6/10: Seems useless compared to SOCOM 1. Very weak.552SD: 6/10: More useless than 552; very weak, but silenced.9mm SUB: 7/10: Similar to the SEALs HK5K, good for headshots.TA 12 GAUGE: 6/10: Dont bother. Use the M3M3 12 GAUGE: 9/10: Automatic, Awesomely deadly, horrible on long range.NEUTRAL GUNS ( used on both sides )M16A2: 9/10: Only gun in the game that shoots on burst, similar to IW except harder to use, must tap trigger, deadly accurate.M14: 10/10: Unbelievebly powerful. Only 20 bullets. Accurate. Considered a ' noobie ' gun by some people.M60E3: 7/10: Considered a ' noobie cannon ', a lot of bullets, bad accuracy, good for killing someone during their reload time.M63A: 7/10: Considered a ' noobie cannon ', a lot of bullets, bad accuracy, good for killing someone durring their reload time.Now, this is how many bullets each gun has per clip.M4A1,M4A1SD,RA-14,IW-80 A2,AK-105, HK5, HK5K, HK5SD, AK-47, AKS-74, STG-77, 552, 552SD, M16A2: ALL HAVE 30 BULLETS9mm SUB: 60 BULLETSM14: 20 BULLETSM63A: 60 or 65 BULLETS ( sorry, i'm not sure )M60E3: 100 BULLETS12 GAUGE PUMP: 8 BULLETSM3 12 GAUGE: 12 BULLETS ( I think. )TA 12 GAUGE: 12 BULLETS ( I think. )Well, I did not include PISTOLS or SNIPERS in there, but i will now.For SEALs, use the MARK 23, MARK 23 SD, or SP-10 for a pistol, and a M87ELR for a sniper.For Terrorists, use the DE.50 or MAYBE the Model 18 ( the only automatic gun in the game ) for a pistol, and the M82A1A for a sniper.That is finally the END of my LOOOONG SOCOM2 review, and I hoped it helped you out.

NFL Street is an awesome game, but it could have been better.I mean when it comes to music and graphics, this game  is #1.There's music by Lil'Jon, the Bravehearts, Nas, Korn, Baby D,Bone Crusher, Dru, KaySlay, Three 6 Mafia, and so much more.And there's no penalties but there's out of bounds. Not to mention cool tricks like Reverse Pass, Flea, Go Long, and FreeFire. And again the graphics are awesome! But to every good side, there's always a bad. And this games bad is that it a cheating game. I caught the ball, right, and when the away team's best tackler fumbled the ball all the way to my side ofthe field, they called it an safety. And one thing that just ticks me off, that really makes me want to just get up and slap somebody's moma(not litterally)is that every time I throw the ball, it is either an interception or a fumble. The only time it isn't is when I have a game breaker. So to all you weak minded people, rent the game to see if you like it first, But ifyou ask me, it's just a waste of a good $50.00.

This sequel to the oddball hit Loco Roco falls in the categories of both "whimsical" and "eccentric".  It's not a puzzle game, but you need to solve puzzles.  It's not a twitch game, but from time to time, the way you twiddle the triggers is everything.  It's not ultra-realistic, and yet physics is an important part of gameplay.In Loco Roco 2, a world of cute creatures made from simple shapes has been overrun with some odd colorless creatures from another world.  They've corrupted the color with black blobs and it's up to you to put things right.  You play a cute little yellow blob that grows bigger as it finds things to eat.  Movement in Loco Roco 2 consists of using the shoulder buttons to tilt the world this way or that and make your blob hop up and down--and it comes down to timing the tiliting/sliding action with the hops to get the blob to go where you want it to.  Your cute little blob is made up of (and can break itself into) bunches of little blobs, and from time to time that is exactly how you have to get through parts of each level.  Levels vary enough to be interesting, with sliding on ice, bobbing on water, or slipping through pachinko-like tunnels in "little-blob" form enjoyable.Everything seems simplistic on the surface, but it can get fairly complicated if you're one of those people who wants to experience it all:  hidden areas, minigames, alternate side goals and more are embedded in the game.  You can replay levels, and the levels can "Level Up" which apparently makes it easier for you to find more goodies.  You also find other characters who become playable as you go along, with slight differences in how they behave.This colorful, simple-shape world is backed by a soundtrack reminiscent of Sesame Street:  it's very childlike and cheery.  While you're playing the game, it adds to the experience.  However, I've found that anyone *not* playing Loco Roco 2 who gets within earshot finds it annoying (and I can't imagine buying the soundtrack CD that's offered here and actively listening to it outside of the game).  Children will most likely enjoy this game, but smaller children who are just getting into gaming would probably have a hard time understanding some of what is expected of them:  they'd probably be more prone to tilting the PSP and expecting things to roll or slide than they would be able to figure out the shoulder-button mechanics.  I expect that the very small will enjoy watching big brother or sister (or mom or dad) while they play, as its Baby-Einstein graphics can make Loco Roco 2 almost hypnotic at times.If you like a bit of puzzling and don't mind a bit of arcade button-mashing, Loco Roco 2 will provide you a gaming experience that strays outside of the mainstream.  Its content is definitely safe for children, and makes a nice break from the typical, "you have bad guys, and you have to shoot/kill/explode/bop 'em on the head" gameplay mechanic that permeates many games.  Its eccentric style may not be for everyone, and its soundtrack may overrun your tolerance for sweetness, but I think it's just part of an excellently-crafted package.  I haven't found everything (or even completely beaten) Loco Roco 2 yet, but I definitely see myself getting there.
Sim City 4 is an awsome game. It is very detailed and complex, a game for a thinking person. The financial stratigies as well is the business and polotical aspects are well covered in this game.

And... if you get bored... there is always a disaster or 2 to throw at your great city.Hit th edownload button, wait a couple hours (the download is 1.2 Gigabyte) and  enjoy!

Jak and Daxter once again disobeyed the Green Sage, and wandered off into Misty Island, an island full of evil creatures and mysical ecos. One of the ecos are Dark Eco, one of the most dangerous toxins known to man. It changes you at random. You could turn into a scientific nerd, an attractive jock, a rabbit, an ottsel, or an insane madman. Two of these things become reality to Jak and Daxter .As they arrived on the island, they noticed something wasn't right. As they moved in to investigate, the saw two warlock and witch looking monsters, ranting about how to "take over the world." Jak and Daxter ran off, but, before they could, poor Daxter fell into a pool of dark eco, and emerged an ottsel...the rest of the story you can figure out yourselves...Jak and Daxter:The Precursor Lagacy was one of the first Playstation 2 games released. With state of the art graphics, witty comeback and an enchanting plot, this is a must have. Buy it if you're a fan of Mario, Banjo-Kazooie, Crash Bandicoot, Tomb raider or Spyro.

This is one of the greatest adventurous challenges to land on Earth. Ratchet & Clank is actually funny, action/adventure where you must save the galaxy from the scoundrel, Chairman Drek and his robotic crew. Ratchet & Clank join together to stop this evil madman. This is nothing compaired to Jak and Dexter.

What's the news on DRAGON AGE 3 ? Will we see Morgan back? Will the Grey Wardens discover the ritual of how Human, Elves, Dwarves & Quitari maidens are converted into Brood Mothers that result into the origins of Hurlocks, Trolls, Shrieks & other Blight Creatures? Will we get to see HAWKE's sister & brother as well as Cassandra?
Dragon Age: Origins was a decent game, but most of the good content are DLC and must be paid for to get the full enjoyment for the game. At the beginning, the player customizes their character to play with, with their race, class, origin (background story), along with how they look like. After they accomplish their origin story, evenually all 6 of the origins (City Elf, Dalish Elf, Human Noble, Dwarf Commoner, Dwarf Noble, and Magi) will come to Ostagar and becomes a Grey Warden. Soon the city is attacked and destroyed, the only survivors are the player and a junior Grey Warden named Alistair. The player is able to recruit characters from throughout Fereldon, the kingdom in which the story takes place. The player's decisions and dialogue, as well as gifts, will influence the party members' approval, which is how much they like or hate you. Having a high approval for characters will give a boost on their stats and for certain characters, a chance for romance. On the other hand, if the approval rating is extremely low, the character may leave or betray you. The recruitable characters in origins are Alistair (human warrior/templar), Morrigan (human mage/shapechanger, Leliana (human rogue/bard), Oghren (dwarf warrior/berserker), Zevran (elf rogue/assassin), Wynne (human mage/spirit healer), and Dog (Mabari Dog warrior). Later in the storyline, at the landsmeet, the player can recruit Loghain Mac Tir (human warrior/champion), but then will risk Alistair leaving the party permanently. The player is supposed to use treaties to recruit armies from different areas of Fereldon to fight the Blight, a army of Darkspawn (tainted enemies) that are led by an archdemon taking the form of a dragon.
Dragon Age 2 is an amazing game. Some have complained about the reuse of enviroments, but this is common in BioWare games. It is seen in games such as Mass Effect and Dragon Age Origins.  However it is more prominent in Dragon Age 2.  With that being said I was so enthralled in the story and characters as well as the character character development (and character links to Dragon Age Origins) that I hardly noticed the areas i was combating in.  Dragon Age 2 is one of the best games I have ever played and I cannot wait for Dragon Age Inquisition. Dragon Age 2 is a must play so that way you can import your world relevancy in to Dragon Age Inquisition and understand the story, of one of the greatest RPGs ever made
Well after I gave poor reviews to Everquest, Everquest II I am giving high reviews to! My hat goes off to sony for making an amazing game. Everquest II is the paragon of fantasy games. Almost all my quibbles I had about Everquest are fixed with Everquest II. I played Everquest for a while and got bored and fustrated that the fun didn't really begin until I became a higher level character. Also solo play and death in Everquest was not fun. It seemed unsurmountable to solo a character past level 20. Well sony listened to players carping criticism and made a better game with Everquest II.Improvements:1) The death system is more congenial in everquest II. You don't loose your body, you don't loose experience, levels, the only attribute that is affected in death is wisdom, you can still equip all your items after death.2) In my opinion graphics transcend any game to date including Doom 3! Surreal graphics, character detail is immaculate, lighting and reflection affects are resplendent. This game is a pearl! My paladin's pulchritude left me stunned. Those incredulous graphics come at a cost though, it requires a goliath of a system to play this game well. My desktop is rigged with a 3ghz processor, 768 megabytes of ram, a 10,000 rpm hard disk - RAID configured, and a Geforce 6600 GT with 128 megs of VRAM and my computer is still not effacacious enough for this game. The ultra high graphic settings in Everquest II can freeze my computer with ease. So I can only image how eye-popping this game can be! The game recommends to play the game at ultra high (maxed out) video system you should have a video card with 512 megabytes of VRAM, YIKES !!! For now I can only play it at a resolution of 1024 x 1280 pixels on a High Quality setting.3) No kill/loot stealing ! This is a treasure trove. I wallow this in everquest II once you attack a monster that monster is locked with you. A little lock appears at the top indicating to other players that kill is all yours and other players cannot barge in and kill the monster ( steal your kill and your experience and loot from that monster). This was an unsurmountable problem in Everquest that vexed me as a player, because some players  were inconsiderate and plundered my experience points and spoils! This is probally one of the biggest reasons why I prefer this game over World of Warcraft, in World of Wacraft no such system like this is in place other players can pillage your earned loot without reprimand. I speak from my own personal experience.4) I wallow in the monolithic labyrinth of timorous passageways and chambers found in the dungeons in Everquest II !! What an improvement the dungeons are from it's predecessor. The dungeons were not all that arousing to me in Everquest, except for mistmore and kurnst. And what is nice about it is a wide range of characters from many different levels can savor these dungeons. I fell in love with Stromhold ! Given my druthers, this is my favorite dungeon. I can still gain experience from this dungeon even at level 27.  The level range of the monsters in this dungeon are from 15 - 25. I have seen characters as low as level 13 and as high as level 30 adventuring through this dungeon. This is a dungeon you can revist over and over again as you level up and pioneer into unfathomable depths. This dungeon doesn't look like a hundred other dungeons, it is a novelty and has its own look. Graphically one of the most jaw dropping zones.5) Even green players can venture through entrancing dungeons and caves. This wasn't true with everquest before the expansions. The origonal everquest was unfriendly to new players, it was only until later after the expansions that they added oddments of new zones and features for the inexperienced characters. YOu can participate in a raid at only level 23 in this game ! In everquest Raids were origonally only reseved for high level characters.6) Equiptment and spells were basic and only a small farrago of items to choose from. The crafting system in Everquest was elemtary and crude. Everquest II is a stark contrast, a conglomeration of hundreds of arms and incantations to pick from. An motley of mythical, legendary, fabled and treasured loot.  Crafting is unparralled in Evequest II. Players can become apt in their chosen craft in little time. Better crafting systems create a more robust economy. The economy in this sequel is so volatile it is surreal ! Spells can be upgraded from other players that specialize in scribing scrolls. All my items I wear are handcrafted by other players. There is just something special about being able to wear items other players tailored specifically for your needs !7) Solo adventuring is actually an option in this sequel. Cresting to that elusive level 60 can be concievably be done alone in this game without any other players help. I enjoyed the fast clip I could level up while playing solo in this game, this was a pampering change compared to its predecessor. This sate my appetite for an online game that had an oustanding single player experience. Leveling up is a lot faster in EQ II also because you never loose experience or levels ! You don't have to worry about recovering a body in order to level up, example in everquest whenever I died I couldn't kill anything or level at all period because all my stuff was gone left on my body somewhere !8) The principal cities in Everquest II, Queynos and Freeport, sate my fantasy reveries. Queynos I found a serene solace where my character would retreat to ease the days tensions. The king arthur atmosphere of the city made me feel as if I was repute and wore a laurel over my head. I had a profound feeling of chivalry and swagger.  Freeport was a becon for vile irreverence and servitude. NPC's were contempt and shallow in this city. The city's sky was marred by the gloom of the precipice turrets and pallisades.cons:1) I think the general opinion that the party system is flawed in Everquest II is a cogent argument. Although I am sure Sony carefully crafted the new party system, anyone who has played the game can't deny the inherent shortcomings. The party system in other games ,like for example World of Warcraft, does not bludgeon the players when they make a fatal mistake. I do not like groups sharing experience debt. This can make playing in groups an irremediable calamity. Players do not like losing expeirence and if I was the cause most players wouldn't hesitate to chafe me with a pompous lecture. Other players would get infuriated and berate me if I died, one group booted me out of the group when I died. I quickly learned some players are pious and haughty about this game. This game overall is quant and pleasing even with its flaws.

The release of Lord of the Rings: Return of the King for xbox was much anticipated by many avid gamers, myself inculded.  When I first purchased the game, I was amazed that there were three different paths that you could take in the game (unlike the Two Towers).  The three paths are: The Way of the King, the Way of the Wizard, and the Way of the Hobbit.  The first battle you are automatically thrown into, however.  This is the end of the battle of Helmsdeep!  You are playing as Gandalf the Gray and must thwart the orcs and save Helms deep!  After you have beaten this level, however, you are free to chose which path you want to take first.  The Path of the King is the hardest and starts off with Aragorn, Gimili, and Legolas going to the undead to enlist their help to fight the Orcs.  The Path of the Wizard is slightly shorter, but not easy.  Here you play only as Gandalf the White and are involved in everything from the destruction of Sauron's tower, to Minas Tirith where you have to run around and knock off the orcs and the bombard towers, to the Courtyard of Minas Tirith where you are charged with protecting the women and children from the orc onslaught.  Lastly, the Path of the Hobbit is hard, but fun.  You play as Sam, most of the time and have to go through everything the hobbits went through in the movie.Once you complete all three paths, you will be able to play the Black Gate level.  Here you can pick from any of these characters (Gimili, Aragorn, Gandalf, Sam, Legolas) and you will have to fight , along side your allies to defeat the armies of Sauron outside his own Gates.On Completion of this level, you will be able to partake in the final level of the Game (The Crack of Doom).  Here you will play as Frodo and have to fight Smeogol inorder to kill him and destroy the ring.  Smeogol is particuarly difficult mainly becuase he is so fast and his hits take down your health fast.  Once you have beaten this level..CONGRATULATIONS!!  Now you can use cheats.  There are two bonus levels (the Palantir of Sauroman) that you can fight to get all of your characters up to max. level 20.  Now you can use all the characters (Gimili, Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pipin, Legolas, Aragorn, Feramir, and Gandalf).As a last note...after the completion of any level, you will be able to buy upgrades for your character with exp. points!  And even better..you can go through the game with a friend!  Co-op missions allow you all the same level, except with a friend by your side!PROS:-  Excellent Graphics-  Co-op missions-  Tons of Levels to play-  After you complete the Crack of Doom, you can go back and replay any mission you want-  Great and useful upgradesCONS:-  On Co-op its not split-screen, you and your friend are on the same screen (which I like but some might not)Hope this helps!

Like The Two Towers before it, EA's Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is pure hack &amp; slash action.  Loaded with even more action than the last game and containing plenty of extras that fans of the films will enjoy, you are thrown head first into battle the moment you load the game as you begin fighting in the ultra epic battle of Helm's Deep from Two Towers.  From then on, Return of the King basically follows the three seperate paths of Gandalf, Frodo, and Aragorn; while allowing you to play as Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, or Sam in different scenarios.  The hack &amp; slash gameplay against hordes of enemies mirrors that of Two Towers, so those who enjoyed that game will most likely enjoy Return of the King.  The graphics are somewhat better than before with some improved character models, while the game's sound and music are excellent.  All in all, fans of the Lord of the Rings film series owe it to themselves to pick this game up; it's the best video game to use the Lord of the Rings license yet.

Dragon Age Origins: Ultimate Edition is a great package.  You get Dragon Age Origins, as well as all of the DLC for the game.  Dragon Age: Origins is one of the best RPG's you will ever play.  Though the graphics as of today are a show their age, the game is still one of the best stories you will ever encounter.  Also, Origins sets up nicely for Dragon Age 2 (which you can import your save data for world relevancy.

Sim-ers have always wanted pets. The additions of fish and hamsters were rather unsatisfying (and sometimes lethal) additions. This new expansion packs will allow your sims to have dogs, cats, parrots, turtles and lizards as well.Lots of new social interactions have been added, althought the Sims website has not been specific as to what those are. Your neighborhoods are bigger - 30 lots each which you can zone for commerical or residential use.  Also there are new homes, new parks, a new cafe, new shops and a farmer's market! Your new dog or cat can be brought to these locales and used to interact with your sim neighbors.  Just like in Downtown, time freezes when you're in the community sections.Each neighborhood will include a pet store, where you can choose from 12 different cats (e.g., black cat and siamese cat), 12 different dogs (e.g., dalmatians, beagles, french bulldogs, spaniels, rotweillers, labs, greyhounds, german shepherds to name a few), 2 different birds (lovebirds and parakeets), or buy a turtle, lizard or fish.  The Maxis folks haven't forgotten any of the details of pets, if you buy a male and a female of the same species, they just might have babies, dogs and cats (and dog and cat people) might not get along, and Kitty might take a liking to your bird or fishBeware - your doggies and kitties (but not the other animals) need to be trained and cared for so they don't go to the bathroom in the house or rip us the trash.  Don't worry - Maxis is kind enough to provide a dog trainer if you're feeling lazy. But, your pets are just like a member of your family - they will have needs and skills which can be acquired (through positive and negative reinforcement). Just like people, you have to develop a relationship with them.  And just like your people, they can die of neglect, so be careful!  Dogs and cats will also misbehave and get grumpy if you don't take care of them.  Dogs and cats can also be entered in pet shows with prizes for obedience, tricks and good pet mood.  You can't bring your pets downtown (although you can probably pick up a date in the pet park) but your whole family (including your pet) goes on vacation with you.There's new stuff for your house too - you can can garden! Grow 4 different veggies in your patch (you have to buy seeds), careful gardening will result in a crop which you can sell (at the farmer's market) or store (in your new kitchen pantry). You might appreciate your pets here as you'll need to watch out for rabbits, gophers, mice and, as Maxis says ominously, other "unwelcome animals that come a callin'." (Mice, which your cat can keep away, will join roaches as house pets.) There will be 125 new objects for you and your pets (no details on those yet either), a new decorator set (New Orleans French Quarter), new skins and 5 new career tracks (fashion design, chef, vet, teacher, circus performer).  Among the new objects are new chairs, new tables, new fountains, espresso machine, pastry cart, spiral staircase, and pet-oriented objects like food bowls, catnip, dog beds, treats, squeak toys, doghouses, pet gyms, chew toys, and scratching posts.

PETSOh, sure, you can get fish or a guini pig without Unleashed, but if you want a more interesting pet, you should get this expansion. Unleashed gives you dogs, cats, birds, turtles and iguanas. There are many different breeds of dogs and cats, and a few different types of birds.Dogs and cats become part of the family, and get the run of the house (even though they shouldn't be able to open your doors). A canine or feline pet can give lonely Sims more social time, and prevent the less outgoing Sims from getting depressed. Unfortunatly, you can't make the dog/cat eat, sleep, or play on command, and you can't stop it from drinking out of the toilet or relieving themselves on your carpet.THE NEIGHBORHOODWith the Unleashed expansion, you now have a total of 41 lots! You also have the cool option of making a community lot. You  can build restaurants, markets, pet shops, and other places for your Sims to socialize. What's really cool is that you don't have a budget to worry about!Another nice addition is that now you can build a house before your Sim moves into it. Half the fun in The Sims is just building the houses!OTHER BONUSESNow your Sims can live off their own land by tending a garden. After you harvest, choose to put your vegetables in a pantry for later or sell them at the market.Unleashed is a great addition to The Sims. Anyone who enjoys The Sims should definately pick this one up.

You also have the cool option of making a community lot. You  can build restaurants, markets, pet shops, and other places for your Sims to socialize. What's really cool is that you don't have a budget to worry about!Another nice addition is that now you can build a house before your Sim moves into it. Half the fun in The Sims is just building the houses!OTHER BONUSESNow your Sims can live off their own land by tending a garden. After you harvest, choose to put your vegetables in a pantry for later or sell them at the market.Unleashed is a great addition to The Sims. Anyone who enjoys The Sims should definately pick this one up.
I'm a genuine Sims enthusiast, but I'm kind of disappointed by this latest expansion pack.  It has some neat stuff, though.  About 8 new outfits for men and women, and 2 new outfits for girls and boys.  There are also some new adult heads.  And of course there are new floors and wallpapers.  (But this isn't too thrilling because you can download just about any kind of floor or wall or outfit off the internet!)  There are a few new doors (including a saloon door and restroom doors for male/females) and some windows (none too exciting), 2 new staircases and a transporter/elevator thing.  Add to that, some new shrubs, fences, and a cactus, and your Sim's yard can look really neat.  Indoors, there's new furniture.  They've added some new bamboo stuff, so if you want to reinact &quot;Survivor&quot;, that shouldn't be a problem.  They've also added new decor and accessories in the themes of Western, Disco, Warehouse, and more.  Then comes the fun stuff: a bubble blower, a buffet table, a cake for a dancer to pop out of, a light-up dance floor, a dance cage, etc.  Plus a new option to hire a caterer.  However, the price of this game seems a little steep for the amount of new stuff you get (which aint much).  But if you love the Sims and can't get enough of them, this is bound to brighten up your little Sim houses and make things a little more fun.  So... this is not a must-have but it's still pretty cool.  (Note: I have a newish computer and with this latest expansion pack installed, the game runs a lot slower than it used to... that's kind of frustrating.)

Your sims are like your second family. Now you can adopt a cute kitten or puppy, or even get budgies, lovebirds, turtles, iguanas and goldfish!There are all sorts of accessories that come with the pets, too. There are different sizes of cages for the birds, a fishbowl of course for the fish. There are lizard cages and turtle cages.For the dogs and cats, there are climbing toys, squeeze toys, food dishes of various sizes, and an assortment of sleeping containers. You can go with the inexpensive curl-up spot to the deluxe canopied princess bed.The birds and reptiles are just bought "as is", but when you buy your puppy or kitten you can choose its gender and from 15 different types. For cats, go from siamese to striped to minx with no tail. For the dogs, you can get 101 dalmatians, or maybe a terrier is more your style? The web also offers many, many other skin types if your favorite breed doesn't come with the software.The pets are GREAT. The cats hunt mice, the dogs learn to sit and stay. You can play with your parakeets, taking them out on your finger. I have 3 parakeets at home and they chirp like wild when the budgies come on the screen! So the sounds are definitely very good.In addition to the pets, this expansion also offers five new careers - education, fashion, circus, culinary and animal care. You can grow food in your garden if you wish, and there are new places to visit in town, including a pet show to show off your new friends.But the highlight of course are the pets. You can't control them - you just interact with them. But the interaction can be quite fun. Before you know it, other neighborhood pets will be wandering by to say hello! A must-have for any Sim lover, it really adds a lot to an already addictive game.

The Sims 2: Free Time EP gives you Sim the opportunity to have hobbies.  Sims can now have many interests which include Cuisine, Nature, Music and Dance, Sports, Fitness, Arts and Crafts, and Tinkering plus a few others. You can use older items from the Sims to build Sims interest in their hobbies.  The easel is builds up interst in Arts and Crafts, the telescope increases interest in Science, and the swimming pool increases interest in Fitness.  Sims can "tinker" with the showers, bathtubs and garbage disposals.  It also inclues new items like the car for Tinkering, a pottery wheel and sewing machine for Arts and Crafts, and ballet bar for Music and Dance.  When Sims build up interest (similar to building skill points) they open up different options like the ability to talk about their hobby, read about their hobby, and blog about it.  They can also subscribe to hobby magazines and gain memberships to clubs on secret lots.  When the interest is maxed out Sims get "in the zone" and their needs go down more slowly.  Sims also get a Lifetime aspiration meter and can get a Secondary Aspiration.This EP also includes some much wanted new items for babies and toddlers.  There is a new style of baby furniture items, including a crib with a canopy, and the activity table which toddlers and children can build their mechanical and creativity skill points.  The activity table is my favorite new item included in this EP.The downside to this EP is that it has some problems.  The Sims needs decline much more quickly with this EP.  It's is hard to build up hobby interest when the Sims energy, hunger, and hygiene go down very quickly.  Another issue is that the nannies refuse to use any of the new baby items that came with Free Time.  They won't put the babies in the crib and they won't use the new changing table.  Instead they lay the babies on the floor and change them in the middle of the room, leaving a dirty diaper laying there.  Other people have complained that the EP is incompatible with the kitchen and bath items from the Kitchen and Baths Stuff Pack.  The Sims cannot tinker with the new showers or tubs and they can't get leftovers or make platters with the new fridges.  However, EA games does have a patch on the Sims 2 website that fixes some of these issues. I think this EP is definitely worth getting but it definitely requires the patch.
Even if you aren;t the most romantic kid on the block, you'll love Maxis's third expansion pack for &quot;The Sims&quot;: Hot Date. Not only does this pack add new skins (faces and outfits), objects, (such as the heart-shaped hot-tub), and wall/floor coverings, it also adds the all new &quot;Downtown&quot; area and dozens of new interactions (such as Suave kiss, Jump-Into-Arms hug, and Check Out). Downtown is a great new place because it now allows your Sims to go out to dinner, shop for new clothes, and meet new people. Also, if that isn't enough to do, you can add to the compilation of Downtown lots already given to you with the game by creating your own. Add a mall, restaurant, whatever you can think up to entertain those interseting little creatures, the Sims. After you have purchased The Sims, Livin Large, and House Party, purchase Hot Date. It will add a little romance to your Sims' sad lives.

First there was Half-Life, a game released by Valve Software back in November 1998, and it was good,  Then came Team Fortress, the multiplayer MOD add-on, and Opposing Forces; they were also good.  Half-Life: Game of The Year Edition soon followed as did the Adrenaline Pack and Counter Strike.  And now Sierra brings to the masses Half-life: Platinum Edititon, and it is terrific.Although Team Fortress and Counter Strike are availabe for download this is still an excellent package that belongs on any first-shooter aficionado's shelf.  The complete package contains Half-Life: Game Of The Year Edition, Opposing Forces, Team Fortress, and Counter Strike.  To state that Half-Life is a brilliant game is like stating that the sun shines brightly in space.  You have to own this game to appreciate it.System requirements are a Pentium 133 with a 3D accelerator card as an option. The game can be run in software but I've always run it with acceleration.  EAX and A3D are also supported for 3D sound as well.Half-Life: Platinum Edition is well worh the dollars and is a perfect introduction to the Black Mesa universe.

I am a big fan of Kurosawa (Seven Samurai, Ran). I have also read Shogun by Clavell as well as Musashi and Taiko by Yoshikawa. I even play the board game by Avalon Hill - Samurai Sword, previously known as Shogun (check it out on this site). Of course, this is one of the period that the PC game Shogun: Total War Warlord Ed. is dealing with - 16th Century Japan. It also deals with the Mongol Invasions of Kublai Khan. I have been playing it for several nights now and I can honestly say that my wife is getting just a bit ticked off with me because this is all I want to do when I get home - play this game! It's highly addictice if you get around all the game controls, but not in a Diabo II (mindless RPG) sort of way. It is addictive because it really sets up the atmosphere of 16th century Japan beautifully - from the basic military units, the special units (emissary, ninja, geisha, priest), to the music - kodo drums and all!

Valve has made itself distinct in the PC world of gaming. We've all played through at least one session of Gordon Freeman clobbering some headcrab, have fond memoriories of a killer game of Team Fortress, and each time we see the fat man with the knob on his dome, we recognize how much skill Valve has. But Valve take the easy way out, by making the Orange Box a smourgasboard of games, but small ones.The Orange Box is a great game deal, there's no denying that; the entire Half Life 2 collection with the 2nd sequal, the much innovative, mind-blowing Portal, and one of the origonal class-based multiplayers, Team Fortress 2. While there is 5 games total, the only true full game is the origonal Half Life 2. Both sequals are just episodes(half a game), not a full fledged 20+hr game, which goes the same for Portal, Valve's interpetation of a test lab rat. Among all the gold(or orange) in the Box, Portal truly is a diamond, by circling around a wormhole-generator gun as the main gameplay mechanic, using it to solve puzzles for a appliance company. Seems simple enough, but innovation is just breaking into games now(outside Nintendo). Portal is enjoyable enough, fun enough, and brillant enough to stand on it's own two feet, but Valve gives it 4 support beams to fall back on, channling the Box as a pilot game to lauch a hopefull franchise.After hitting the snooze button for 10 years, Valve woke up to the fans call of a 2nd edition of Team Fortress. Instead of following the sequal norm of an upgraded graphic engine, Valve rehauls the whole look, flip-flopping over to a Pixar-type look, Incredibles, if I had to call one out, but ramped up violence/blood is what slappes the M on the box more than anything. Valve keeps one eye on TF2 online, now giving patches and updates for the unpopular clases, which keeps gameplay fresh and stops Valve from pumping out another full fledged game. Team Fortress has a great online community, but thats just it. It's ALL online, nothing else. No offline services, which isen't to bad, but when fans get love affairs for certain maps, the play-feild gets real stale.Even though Valve gave us 5 games(4shorties) it's has all the makings for the perfect game sequal: a strong foundation to build off of(Half-Life 2), fresh new ideas, while still keeping to it's roots(Episodes 1 and 2, Portal), plus, a killer multiplayer function(Team Fortress 2). Valve put all of the ideas in the same box, but just put barriars between them.
The Half-Life 2: Episodes are solid expansions of the quality people have come to expect from Valve games. Like the older Half-Life 2, they are well received by critics, well-supported, widely loved, and continue to build on one of the FPS genre's most defining franchises. No video game library is complete without the Half-Life series.Half-Life 2: Episode 2 also contains several fun Steam achievements that will be displayed on your Steam community profile page after you've attained them, distinguishing you from lesser gamers who have not. The HL2: Episodes continue to build on the ground breaking story originally laid out by the older Half-Life games. For those who have not yet played Half-Life 2, I strongly suggest going with The Orange Box, which comes with a couple other quality Valve games which are also worth playing (though not as good as the Half-Life games in my opinion); namely Team Fortress 2 and Portal. The Orange Box is the best deal you'll find in gaming right now, and Amazon has it at a good price, so I highly recommend that if you don't already own most of the games in the Orange Box.Half-Life 2: Deathmatch also provides a multiplayer component to the Half-Life 2 set. While the Half-Life series' multiplayer leaves something to be desired, the single player component of the game is of absolutely unrivaled quality. There is no series I would recommend more highly than the classic Half-Life series, widely regarded as containing some of the best video games of all time (most notably Half-Life 2 and the original Half-Life). 5/5 stars - a must have for any PC gamer!
We're slowing getting toward the ultimate boxing game. This is a big improvement in many ways over the last Fight Night game. However, although it is realistic in a lot of ways it seems as though you are able to throw way too many punches per round. I had an Ali vs Tyson match last night and the punch output was ridiculous. Ali threw everything at me but the kitchen sink including countless arcade-like power-punches! I landed a lot of good punches playing as Mike but they didn't seem like they were that effective. Everyone knows that if Mike hits you with a clean full impact punch, you're gonna get knocked down at the very least! But then again, I had played a few matches as Thomas Hearns and I was able to box just as he did.The lighter weight matches seem more realistic in that there is a higher punch output which suits the game better. I'm happy that they included a great deal of legendary fighters like Chavez, Duran, Hagler, Hearns, Foreman and so on. But I cannot see why they couldn't include Joe Louis, Rocky Marciano, Larry Holmes and Bernard Hopkins. I'm hoping for that either in the next game or an expansion pack. Anyway, I highly recommend the game! It ranks alongside of Knockout Kings 2001, Punch Out! and Victorious Boxers 1 & 2 as one of the very best boxing games ever created!
The best way to get into Half-Life is to own it and every element of it so why not own it for the price of one game! If you are like me you like to have it all. I started playing the Half-Life games, purchasing them one by one spending alot of money, but it was worth it. But now since all the games are bundled together you can take the same path many people have been doing; starting at Half-Life and working to Counter-Strike and being a Half-Life MASTER for cheap!Half-Life -- You are Gordon Freeman, a research associate at the Black Mesa Research facility. It was just another day at the lab until your experiment blew up in your face. Now, with aliens coming through the walls, a military death squad on the rampage, and your panicking colleagues at the top of the endangered species list, you need to scramble to stay alive.Team Fortress Classic -- This online action game features a wide array of character classes from Medic to Spy to Demolition Man enlisted in a unique style of online team warfare. TFC has been downloaded by millions of people, becoming one of the most popular online action games of all time.Half-Life: Opposing Force -- Return to the Black Mesa Research facility as one of the military specialists sent to eliminate Gordon Freeman. In addition to its exciting single-player experience, Opposing Force features a large collection of fresh multiplayer content including new weapons, player characters and 15 new multiplayer maps.Half-Life: Counter-Strike -- The ultimate multiplayer gaming experience, Half-Life: Counter-Strike combines all the elements of the Half-Life online universe with all new single- and multiplayer content. At the heart of this package is the Counter-Strike MOD, the number one played online action game built as an add-on for Half-Life. Counter-Strike is team-based, and casts players in the role of terrorist or counter-terrorist. Also included are three new MODs created by some of the top level designers within the Half-Life community.Counter-Strike has been the last big Half-Life mod out since Team Fortress Classic and will be in heavy competition with Team Fortress Classic 2 when that ships.Just do yourself a favor and play all of Half-Life. It is a fun and extremely exiting adventure that you wont regret!

I was anticipating this one for awhile, as the release date was pushed back multiple times, which initially caused me to worry, &quot;Are they pushing it back because it's so awful they dare not release it?&quot;  Well, KK2k1 is finally here, and the wait was worth it.This series always had so much potential in its earier incarnations.  But the boxers were always too unresponsive, play was too slow, and sometimes the AI was a little too brutal to the point where what was meant to be a boxing sim turned into a Ready To Rumble style arcade slugfest.  Well, fear not, as the control problems have been solved, and we are left to gaze upon the best modern console boxing game available.KK2k1 has TONS of real guys in all 3 weight classes: Ali, Frazier, Joe Louis, Sugar Ray Leonard, Sugar Ray Robinson, Holyfield, Lennox Lewis, Butterbean (!), Hagler, Camacho, De La Hoya, Spadifora, Julio Cesar Chavez, Hurricane Carter (from the movie &quot;The Hurricane,&quot;) Jake LaMotta (from the Deniro film &quot;Raging Bull,&quot;) Rocky Marciano, Frank Bruno, Alexis Arguello, Ike Quartey, Pernelll &quot;Sweet Pea&quot; Whitaker, Jack Dempsey, and even more that I can't remember right now.  Not to mention the female boxers.  The roster is almost perfect (Though no Tyson, he's got his own really awful boxing game on PS1, and no George Foreman.)  There are even a few hidden characters, like Oakland A's slugger Jason Giambi.There are several modes available to fit all tastes.  Slugfest mode basically echos the Ready To Rumble series, you take 2 boxers, with a very close camera view, and you just wail on one another.  Exhibition mode pits any two real boxers against one another (regardless of weight class.)  Career mode is the best though.  You create your own boxer, then put him through a series of fights, just like in the old Punch-Out for NES.  The guys you fight in that mode are classics!  An old gray-haired guy with the nickname of &quot;Old Bones,&quot; and other colorful characters.  The fights start out easy, against no-names in sleazy corner fight joints.  Then they progress to longer bouts in more impressive venues against real opponents.  You not only get to customize yor boxer, but you also get to choose your gym, and your training team, each of which gives you between-match points to build your character's ability levels.  There are also training sessions between matches that supply you with more points to better yourself.  Very realistic, and very fun.  The last mode is a &quot;Fantasy Fight&quot; mode that pits real boxers (often of different time periods) against one another in &quot;what might have been&quot; scenarios.As for the gameplay, it is top-rank.  Each boxer will have punches that work for him.  As far as traits go, some boxers are speedy, some have awesome stamina, or maybe great power, some have sturdy chins that take a beating, and some get cut very easily.  The combinations make every fighter different, and you have to know what they do/don't do well so you can plan accordingly.  Wailing away at the head of someone with a 99 rating for Chin will be like wailing away at a brick wall.  Each fighter has strengths and weaknesses that must be found and exploited.  This includes your champ as well.There are 4 basic punches mapped to the four buttons: jab, cross, hook, and uppercut.  Body punches are achieved by holding L2 and hitting those same buttons.  There are many different punch combos to utilize, some work better than others depending on your boxer.  The control is very easy to learn, yet takes time to master.  It isn't nearly as difficult to dance around the ring as before, but if there is one problem with the game, it is the same one that has plagued this series from the beginning: getting out.  It is easy to come in and land punches, but backing up to get out isn't always as responsive as you would like it to be, resulting sometimes in your opponent getting a parting shot that wouldn't have landed if the control had moved your guy when you told it to.  But other than minor control stickiness like that, there is really nothing bad to be found.There are real fight venues (Madison Square Garden, Caesar's Palace, Wembley UK) real referees (Mills Lane) real ring announcers and real commentators that make other EA Sports games sound ultra-lame in comparison ....  No doubt about it, this game is the pinnacle of boxing titles.  It has all the realism of a real fight and all the fun of the best console boxing games to come before it.  Did I mention the great soundtrack from rappers that can actually rap?  Well, it's got that too ....  This game has everything going for it, and gamers like me that have been waiting for a good boxing game for ages will eat this up.  2001's first &quot;must-have&quot; PS2 title.

As I mentioned in my review for Prototype, this game (Infamous) has little in common with the other aside from you controlling a guy with new superpowers in a fully explorable and quarantined city killing bad guys. This game opens in the fictional Empire City as it suffers from an enormous explosion that almost completely levels one of the city's three islands. After the explosion, bike messenger Cole MacGrath awakens in the center of the explosion's blast crater and soon finds that he has been endowed with the ability to channel electricity and use it to fry his enemies. As he grows accustomed to his powers, life in Empire City starts going down the tubes: the government has quarantined the city due to some kind of plague that seems to be driving people mad, gangs have divided up and taken control over all three of the city's islands, most of the police have either been killed or are hiding out in fear, and everyone else is struggling to survive in this modern day wild west. Cole has the power to change things for the better, bringing hope and peace back to the city... or he could simply make things better for himself and ignore the needs of others. Regardless of what road he chooses, Cole will undergo many missions in order to find a mysterious device called the Ray Sphere, which is what caused the explosion and gave Cole his electric powers. These missions will involve Cole restoring power to the different sections of the city, taking out the gangs/police patrolling the streets, and a couple missions where you protect a friendly target from enemies. There are also many side missions where you destroy reinforced buses armed with machine guns that attack the city, track down hidden enemies, follow enemy messengers without being spotted to a drop off, put a stop to gang wars, and much more. Similarly to Spider-Man 2, Cole can access these missions by approaching citizens who call out to him. Cole has a karma meter that will go up after good acts or down after evil acts.He soon gains three electric abilities that he can perform on wounded enemies and civilians; he can restrain, heal, or drain them of their bioelectric energy (bioleech). Healing civilians grants him positive karma points, while restraining civilians and using bioleach on civilians or even enemies gives him negative karma points. Killing civilians and police also of course gives Cole negative karma. This can be a pain for those who want to be good guys since the civilians tend to sometimes run straight into the middle of a shootout between Cole and his enemies and get themselves killed. At least those who want to be bad don't have to worry about collateral damage, they can go nuts. There are also some good and evil side missions which grant further positive and negative karma points respectively. Cole can work for justice and do things like herd prisoners to a police station, join the police on raids against gangs, and capture enemies without killing them; or he can be a bad boy and herd captured gang members to a group of rival gang members for execution, join gang members on attacks against the police, and assassinate people. There are also many set-pieces and random encounters where Cole will be faced with a moral dilemma and must choose to either make the right or selfish decision, and these choices give you the largest amounts of karma points. The game kind of goes into freeze frame mode while Cole weighs the pros and cons of his two possible choices. Most of these "moral dilemmas" are pretty black and white, making it obvious which decision you should make if you know whether you want to be good or bad. For example, when faced by a guy who's barring your progress through a door because he's worried about his wife, you have to decide whether to tell him that his wife was killed or you can simply zap your way through the door and the guy himself. There is one moral dilemma during the last quarter of the game that will give you pause and make you actually think about which decision you should make, so more of the other moral choices should have been like that.Now for the good stuff, Cole's powers and abilities. He starts out with a regular electric zapping attack called the Lightning Bolt that allows him to shoot at enemies from an over-the-shoulder perspective at a distance, as well as an Electromagnetic Shockwave where Cole shoots out a short-range wave of electrical energy that could blow enemies or even cars back. During the missions where he goes through the sewers to restore power to sections of the city, Cole will acquire new electric abilities such as Shock Grenades, Megawatt Hammers (balls of electricity fired like missiles), Precision (a more powerful, long-range lightning bolt), and Lightning Storm (I'll let you see that one for yourselves). Most of these powers and other abilities can be upgraded through the EXP Cole earns by completing missions and defeating enemies. There are a couple of other electric powers Cole acquires that depend on whether he's good or evil, although more wide-range area-of-affect electric attacks would have been nice. He can even beat up enemies with electrically charged melee attacks, mostly punches and flip kicks, but you'll be using his ranged attacks a lot more than his melee ones. All of Cole's ranged attacks, as well as one specialized melee attack, use up power nodes from Cole's energy meter, except the Lightning Bolt which has infinite "ammo". Cole can increase his energy meter after collecting a certain number of Blast Shards which are scattered all over the city.There's no visible health meter, but as Cole receives damage the sides of the screen get splattered with blood and everything goes black and white with lowered sound as Cole is near death. His health will regenerate if he keeps himself from suffering further damage, but absorbing electricity from power sources like light poles and generators will not only regenerate his health, but also refill his energy meter. Plus, make sure to keep Cole out of the water, for obvious reasons. Small puddles won't hurt him, but waist deep water is less than healthy for the guy. Cole also specializes in parkour/urban exploring, so he can jump across light poles, powerlines, and rooftops. He's also very adept at climbing up and down buildings by grabbing onto window sills, pipes, railings, and other available handholds; in fact, he's a little too good at grabbing these things and sometimes has trouble simply letting go of these handholds and standing flat on a rooftop. Despite his gifted climbing skills, Cole can't climb up chain link fences, which simply doesn't make sense. Later on, he'll be able to travel through the city more fluidly by gaining the ability to use his electricity to grind along train tracks and powerlines, as well as use Static Thrusters to glide over slightly longer distances. Somehow, Cole's electric powers allow him to survive drops from very high buildings; it's convenient, but confusing.The game's combat is a bit repetitive, but still fun and challenging. The three islands of Empire City have been taken over by three gangs: former drug dealers in red hoodies who have been mutated into Reapers, homeless people who encased themselves in trash armor to become the Dust Men, and the secret organization with ties to the Ray Sphere called the First Sons. Most of the guys in these groups shoot at you with assault rifles (and incredible aim), but they also have their own guys who were affected by the Ray Sphere and have their own powers like telekinesis, invisibility, and smaller scaled electric powers. Aside from the Blast Shards, Cole can also track down and collect Dead Drops left behind by an undercover agent who infiltrated the First Sons, which are all audio recordings that reveal interesting background information. The story is also told through many in-game cutscenes and several comic book themed cutscenes between chapters that look like they were pulled right out of a comic book. These scenes give the game a nice look, as well as a cool storytelling element when Cole narrates them.The cutscenes change somewhat depending on whether you're good or evil, but not too greatly; the more noticeable differences between being good or bad are reflected through the way the city changes along with Cole. If Cole is good, the city begins to appear more well put together, posters are put up depicting Cole as a hero, citizens cheer for and praise the hero, and Cole himself looks just like the way he does on the game's cover. If Cole is evil, the city remains a dump, posters are put up showing how "infamous" Cole is, citizens will cower in fear or attack the villain, and Cole appears more grimy and pale... and uses cool looking red lightning. The game's graphics are pretty nice. While Empire City doesn't vary too greatly in design, it's still modeled well with its many buildings and tree-filled parks. The characters also have good designs, especially Cole and the main villains, of which there are three and they serve as the game's entertaining boss fights. Aside from the somewhat repetitive combat and a couple of movement glitches here and there, this game has a lot going for it: a good story, interesting characters and enemies, cool powers, nice graphics, and tight controls. If you want to take part in the origin story of the latest superhero/supervillain, then I suggest buying or at the very least renting this game. Totally worth it.
My son like the game thanx it waz jus wut we ordered we will b ordering more games later thanx again
This game is great. Love the over the top karmic strikes and different powers plus Delsin is sarcastically funny. Its a little short in my opinion but with the karma system it has a good replay ability also really enjoy the paper trail missions. Already passed the game with hero karma, working on villain next.
Sure Infamous Second Son is short but I'm expecting some downloadable content soon to spice things up a bit. I loved Infamous 1 and 2 to the point no one will ever replace Cole in my heart.  Cole was THE MAN!  Delsin Rowe would have to be pretty awesome before I would embrace him as the new face of Infamous.  Delsin Rowe is no Cole and I'm happy he never tries to be. Delsin Rowe is his own man.  Cole was pragmatic almost sensible unless you made him mad.  Delsin Rowe is younger and more a wisenhiemer, always ready with the smart*** wise crack.  Tagging every nice spot he see's. Delsin Rowe is a young guy who makes up his mind he is not going to put up with the crap DUP is doing to otherwise good people.Delsin Rowe is smart enough to resist the DUP brain washing news spin cycle that labels everyone with unique conduit powers an instant bio-terrorist.  I love the message in Infamous that says do not be a sheep.  The other totally cool thing in Infamous Second Son is that it lets you choice your moral nature.  I was not always a paragon, I was not always the good guy.  Sometimes I killed a few good guys who got in the way to get the bad guys.  I love how Infamous teaches that despite all our humanity none of us is perfect.  Infamous Second Son gets me viscerally excited often during the game my true darker passions are at play which sort of shows me how much work I have to do in becoming more humane.  Oh yeah I love the story, I love the character its all good.  I upped my rating to reflect new information I was provided.Some reviewers say Infamous Second Son is not funny.  They must not have done any of the Spray Paint mini missions.  The graphic spay can art is funny.  The fact that you must start the artwork is fun.  The fact that the final concept is revealed only after a blackout screen is hilarious.  Delsin Rowe says more than his share of funny things.  Also when Delsin Rowe does the power dive as he becomes the BOMB his grinning I really love this facial expression is priceless. I like that Delsin Rowe is so laid back.  I enjoyed killing all the drug dealers whenever they appeared.  I enjoyed blowing up those DUP sentry towers and their crawer squad vehicles.  The fact that Delsin Rowe's lady friend calls him as he is climbing the "Space Needle" was awesome and funny.People say Infamous Second Son was repetitive well you are fighting an army of occupation.  Occupying armies are not known for their inventitiveness. Ask anyone who has been in the real army.  Armies are about olive drab sameness at the grunt level. Armies of occupation thrive on maintaining the good order using the exact tools seen in the game.  Checkpoints, street level traffic control.  Solders walking around their posts being borded stiff most of the time till you show up to blow their shift with life treatening excitement. All the battles were just right in their difficulty. Oh man this thing has replayability all over it. The graphics were first rate.  The game play mechanics while not perfect were a great improvement over Infamous 1 and 2.  The Delsin Rowe character is more sticky, agile and quick.  The Delsin Rowe  responds better to controller input than any Infamous game ever.  As for frame rate drop or lagging of any kind performance issues I have not seen none.I waited for Second Son patiently for years.  At first Second Son was scheduled to release in December 2013 I brought a PS4 especially to play Second Son.  They pushed the Second Son release out to April and I returned my PS4.  The ONLY reason I brought my PS4 a few days ago was so I could play Infamous Second Son.  Yes I love this Infamous franchise that much. I di dnot expect to really like Delsin Rowe since he was more young and wild than Cole.  To my surprise I ended up loving Delsin Rowe  like a member of the family, he earned his place in my heartfelt respect on his own merit.  I paid full price for Infamous Second Son and I do not feel ill used at all.  Matter of fact Infamous: Second Son is one of the best video purchases I've ever made.  Now all I must do is wait for MASS EFFECT 4 and Borderlands 3 in PS4 format.This Infamous Second Son ROCKS some reviewers think otherwise but, in my honest appraisal I can't find much to hate about this game.  Bring on the Downloadable Content and give me an excuse to play Infamous Second Son again and again!
Acrobatic and electric, inFamous is fun from beginning to end.  After a mysterious accident gives him his awesome electrical powers and destroys most of the city, protagonist Cole must navigate his way through the ruins of the city to unravel the mystery behind the destruction and what part he played in it.  I use the term protagonist because Cole does have several opportunities to choose which moral path he can follow.  He can choose to be benevolent and use his powers to save his fellow citizens or intimidate and crush those that oppose him.  The story essentially follows the same arc regardless of which moral choices you pick but some of the subplots and side missions will be affected by those choices.  Either way you will end up will a truly awesome array of powers and the chance to roam the decimated city at your leisure.  One thing that the creators did note, and that I found on my playthoughs, is that the hero path is more difficult.  There are more defensive/escort missions on that path and collateral damage can be your worst enemy.  The tight free-running controls and intense powers make this a real pleasure to play.  Highly recommended.
What would you do if you had super powers? Become a hero or become a villain? inFAMOUS gives you a chance at both.
Infamous Second Son is a beautifully crafted game that compliments the series, yet is also capable of standing on its own. The graphics are superb and the gameplay is full of action. This game does a wonderful job of showing off the potential of the PS4.You are Delson Rowe, younger brother of a newly elected sheriff. You accidentally siphon the powers of a so called "bio terrorist." This leads you and your brother to Seattle, Washington.In this contemporary Seattle, the Department of Unified Protection (DUP), led by a ruthless woman named Brooke Augustine, hunts bio terrorists. Augustine has powers of her own, and she has bestowed some of her powers unto the DUP troops under her command. DUP has militarized much of the city, and they run patrols as well. DUP's oppressive presence is evident in the attitudes of the people.Your goal is to stop the DUP and its powerful leader. First, though, you need to increase your powers, or you'll be no match for Augustine.Seattle is divided into districts. Each district has main story quests, along with many side activities. You gradually erode the DUP's presence in a district by doing all of the activities, then challenging the DUP in a district showdown, in which you must defeat a group or groups of DUP soldiers that are dispatched to your location.You will gain powers through main story quests. Other powers are purchased by collecting blast shards, which are also used to upgrade your powers.It's autumn, apparent from the colorful trees. The rain effects look great and don't hinder performance at all. I noticed no framerate issues regardless of all the action in the populated city. I did notice some infrequent texture tearing in the form of fallen enemies meshing together like a two-headed, four-armed and -legged mutant.You'll gain four classes of powers, not counting melee. The effects are stellar, and the visuals of Delson recharging his powers are literally the coolest thing I've seen in a game in decades.I would like to see more story implementation in the side activities. Much time is spent in combat, exploring, and doing side activities. It's easy to forget what the main mission is because it's so easy to get side tracked. Once you hit the main story icon, however, you quickly get back on track.The controls are excellent. The map and powers tree are easy to understand and navigate. This game looks and plays like a dream. The great thing about Infamous is that it warrants two play throughs---one as good and one as evil. Each has its own particular powers, and the story tilts to go with whichever side you choose. The world and your character no longer turn gray when playing evil. Now it's just Delson's clothes that change color. Of note, only the decal on Delson's default vest changes to represent his karma (good or evil). Decals on the bonus vests do not change.One thing I don't particularly care for is the requirement of creating a separate online account with a computer in order to experience the additional content in the game. This content is called "Paper Trail." It offers more things to do as content is periodically released. I think this should be downloadable from the PSN store, not require the player to log on to an account with their computer. I think this is a hassle. This is the only hang-up I have with the game.I highly recommend Infamous Second Son. It's a blast to play and the graphics are nothing short of awesome. If you're a fan of the series, you'll appreciate the improvements in Second Son. If you're new to the series, you're in for a treat.
This is definatlly 1 of the best gamecube games ever.  I never knew wut it wus until i played it for x-box.  I thought it wus really kool.  Than i found out it wus for gamcube and i wus soo excited.

I earned the platinum trophy of the first 2 Infamous games ( look me up: iceveiled). This is the best infamous game to date. Cole was an unlikable, brooding grump who didn't appreciate his powers.Delsin embraces his powers positively. It's way more fun to play as him. Sure he's a little cocky, but there's a humanity to him that's endearing. What I'm loving the most, and what surprised me the most, are the graffiti mechanics and how it has you hold the DS4 controller upright like a can of spray paint, using the right trigger and motion controls as if you were holding a can of spray paint. Brilliant. I never saw it coming but it's that little artistic touch that sold me from the start. I find myself seeking out the graffiti spots when I go to a new zone in Seattle just to see what's next (whoever designed the graffiti art at  Sucker Punch needs a raise.....the graffiti art is both clever and endearing).Delsin's powered up smoke ability where he launches up to the sky/camera and grins his charismatic, knowing grin before he plummets to the earth never got old and always brought a smile to my face.Series fans: if you're reluctant to dive into the sequel because of the character change, fear not. Delsin is freaking awesome. The story is memorable and the powers you adopt along the way are fun as hell.Greatness awaits with this game.

Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus is one of the most beautiful platformers I have ever seen. And Sly Cooper is, inarguably, the most charming platform character to appear on a system since the talented, impatient Sonic the Hedgehog won gamers hearts on Sega Genesis in the early '90s.

It has been 8 years since Sly 3. I thought that Sly 3 will be the final game for Sly, but I was wrong. The game takes place after Sly 3 and the pages of Sly's book, Thievieus Racconus, started to disappear and it is up to Sly and his gang to travel in time to solve everything about Sly's ancestors. This game is awesome and hard.Main characters: The Cooper gang, a group of friends who met each other at a orphanage. Sly, the leader of the entire group and a master thief like his late father and ancestors. Murray, the muscles of the group, and Bentley the brains of the group. Carmelita M. Fox, a tough vixen cop also Sly's nemesis and romantic interest.The Cooper Clan, a group of thieves also Sly's ancestors. Rioichi Cooper, a thief, a master ninja also a master sushi chef in Federal Japan. Tennessee Kid Cooper, a thief in the Wild West. Caveman Cooper aka Bob, the oldest and the first Cooper clan member. Sir Galleth Cooper, a thief also a honorable knight in Medieval England. and Salim Al Kupar, a thief who stole treasures with the forty thieves in ancient Arabia.Villains: Cyrille Le Paradox aka The Collector, a thief like the Cooper family, and the main villain. El Jefe, a Cuban tiger who is a ruthless mercenary. Toothpick, a ruthless armadillo gangster and a greedy "sheriff" in the Wild West. The Grizz, a black bear who is a former pop artist and a art thief. The Black Knight aka "Black Tyrant" a large armored soldier with a mystery past. Miss Decibel, a British elephant who is a classic singer and she had a accident in her past leaving her unable to sing.Gameplay: Some chapters are hard and some are easy. The controls are easy and they stay the same from the 3 previous Sly games. In this game, you will play all of the gang members also Sly's ancestors. The treasures are back, the clue bottles are back and you will purchase new badass moves from thief net. Like the previous Sly games, you will get jobs to do and fight the boss. The environments are crazy, beautiful and they make the treasures and the clue bottles hard to find. For the first time, this game had masks for you to collect. If you collect all of the masks, you will get many unlockables, if you get all of the treasures, you will get a surprise that I cannot tell .Graphics: WOW, the creators did a awesome job making Sly 4 and the graphics are beautiful, sharp and crisp.As a fan of Sly Cooper, I gave this game and the rest of the 3 previous games 5 stars
Sly 2: Band of Thieves implies, there are now three characters to play around with. Bentley and Murray played supporting roles in the first game, but this time around they are fully playable and fleshed out characters in their own right. Bentley is a nervous green turtle who supplies the brains behind the operations by making the plans for the gang and taking care of all things computer. Murray is different in every way as a burly hippo who provides plenty of punches, belly flops, and all around brawn to get the dirty work done.

This is one of the best games I has ever played.The worlds are much bigger, the moves are cooler, and you get to play as Murray, who now refers to himself as "The Murray" and Bentley along with Sly.There is this one move with Sly when he throws a bomb that confuses the enemies in the area into killing each other.It is very fun to watch.You can stealth kill and pickpocket this time. There is also a new system called the Thief Net  that allows you to sell your loot for moves online.The game is longer and more complexed this time.In the game, the Clockwork parts are stolen by the Klaww gang and you have to get them back or face the thousand year old menance again.So far I am on episode eight, the last episode.This game surpasses the first one by far.Oh, and Carmilita has a new partner,who is a quadrupel-crosser.Buying this game is a must.

Back when i was still looking for the first Sly Cooper game, my mom asked this guy at a store if they had Sly 1.  The guy said no but asked if she wanted to buy Sly 2 instead.  She said no, but asked if it was any good for the future.  He said "Well, you know why they call it Sly 2 don't you?  Because it's twice as much fun!"  He couldn't have been more right!  I beat the first game, so i decided to move on to the second game.  I loved the first game, but it was short.  This is much better.Rather than just playing as Sly, you can play as Bentley or Murry.  Sly is still my favorite, but Bentley and Murry are both great too.  All of them have their own special abilities that make them useful for all kinds of situations.Sly:  He's good for pickpocketing and sneaking around anywhere.  Unlike the other two, Sly can slide on ropes, climb up pipes, and get to other areas Bentley or Murry couldn't normally get to.Bentley:  In hand-to-hand combat, Bentley's probably the worst out of the three.  Don't let that rattle your bars, though.  Bentley is the ultimate in stealth.  Just use his Binocucom (did i spell that right?) to shoot darts at enemys to put them to sleep.  When they're making ZZzz's, plant a bomb and get out of the way.  Your foe's about to go up in smoke.Murry:  Murry is useful for one thing: fighting.  Murry can knock out any enemy you come across with only a few punches.  He's not the brightest bulb in the box, but he's a fun guy to play as none the less.This game is great.  In the first game you were battling the Fiendish Five.  Now, you're going after someone else.  In Sly 2, you're after the Klaww Gang.  Your main enemy before was Clockwerk, right?  And, if you beat the game, you kicked his butt, right?  Well, now you're going to save his butt.  That's what i said.  You're going to save Clockwerk's butt.  Well, not really.The Klaww Gang must have heard about you kicking Clockwerk's butt, because they went to the lava pool where you did the kicking and stole Clockwerk's parts!  (Whoa!  For all of you out there who took that the wrong way, let me remind you that Clockwerk was a machine and his "parts" are, for example, his tailfeathers, his wings, his eyes, and even his heart.  Now, i hope we have that cleared up.)  Anyway, you have to get those parts back before the Klaww Gang does something with them.Also, some new characters are being introduced, along with the Klaww Gang.  Carmelita is back, but now, she has some assistants.Constable Neyla:  I think she's supposed to be some kind of white tiger, but i'm not sure.  She's about as sexy as Carmelita, so i guess that's why they are working together.  Even the greatest thieves can't excape sex appeal.  Neyla has a way with words and can make anyone trust her.  But can she really be trusted?The Contessa:  OK, i have no idea where we got a lady crossed with a spider as a criminal psycologest, but who would expect a racoon working with a hippo and a turtle?  I never liked the look of Contessa, but now that i have gotten to her in the game, i dislike her even more than before.That is as far as i'm going to go.  I've got typers cramp.  Anyway, i hope you consider this game.  If you havn't played the first one yet, play it, just so you can get a feel for the set up.  Also, you may want to see what Clockwerk is about.  The game is short, so it won't take you long to get to Sly 2.  Both are worth the money.  They belong in anyones game collection.  (Dang, i didn't know i typed so much!  This thing is looooooooooong!)

My real reason for playing this game is both simple and embarassing.  I bought it used for my PS2 only to discover it had trouble plaing on my old model.  It then sat gathering dust until I bought my PS3.  So after an uncertain futre, it has become the first test of the PS3's interplatform compatability.Heaven knows what I expected when I cranked up the game - certainly the lavish explosion of graphics and action that appeared.  It's easy to see, once you start playing, why this game quickly became a favorite of platform and action advention players alike.  And even I, someone who prefers the RPG genre, was quickly drawn into the experience.  the people who put this game together knew how to get the most out of a PS2.You find yourself in a mythical version of Greek mythology as Kratos, a Apartan warrion who, in a moment of rashness, promised his soul to Aries if the god would save his life.  Aries comes through, but abuses Kratos' trust, tricking him into the destruction of his own family.  Kratos desperately seeks to forget the horrors of his misdeeds, and, when offered an opportunity to seek out and destroy Aries, snaps up the opportunity.This is going to drag you through an unending supply of Greek scenery - hacking, maiming, and generally slaughtering everything you meet.  You will get new weapons and magic, power them up, and generally run a bloodbath for the 40 hours or so it takes to play through.  This kind of exhuberant athleticism accompanied by flying parts is sheer fun.  Lots of puzzles must also be solved and some incredible bosses.  You're going to die a lot in the process, but the game generally puts you back someplace reasonably convenient.I don't think you can go wrong with God of War, and I  can testifiy that it survives the trip to the PS3 without a hiccup.

Since I was about 9 years old, I always wanted to pilot a Veritech and finally, with Robotech: Battlecry I got my wish--sort of.  The greatest thing, to me anyway, is that you can change modes on the fly, which gives it about as much realism as you can expect without being in the cockpit.  I love to come screaming in on some Battlepods in Fighter mode than snap to Battloid mode and land in their midst to blow the heck out of them with my gatling gun.  The versatility of being able to choose which mode I want to play in makes it a lot more fun than if you were stuck to one mode per mission, as I suspect would have been the case in the 8-bit days.The biggest disappointment is of course that you aren't Rick Hunter, so you don't get to do all the cool stuff like battle in Saturn's rings or on Mars--Earth's orbit is the farthest you get until the very end.  The story itself is pretty neat and I couldn't believe how it ended, which didn't leave the possibility for a sequel.  I almost--ALMOST--cried at that point for my poor guy who had been through so much.Well anyway, some of the missions are a lot of fun, like the colossal dogfight where you have to save Rick Hunter's bacon, and others are the annoying protect missions like where you have to defend the townspeople of Gravestone and the one where you have to escort the Cat's Eye and somehow defend it while it flies straight and level through a gauntlet of enemy fire.  When I first bought the game, a few of those missions prompted quite a bit of screaming and swearing--much more than a grown man should do at a video game--but ultimately I got lucky and beat them.  There are plenty more of the fun missions than irritating ones.The best mission to me was the one where I finally got to pay Hiro back for bossing me around all the time by disabling his Destroid.  That's also one of the easier missions, but it's just so sweet to knock out one of those whiny, helpless, useless Destroids.As for repeat game play, there's not much to it after you get all the awards and mechs, but sometimes (like right now) I like to go back and start over again to beat it all over again.  Only of course this time I have the invincibility cheat so no Zentraedi can touch my VT.  It's also fun after you have all the mechs to go back and try missions again with an S, R, or Armored Veritech.There's not much more I could have asked for from this game.  It was well worth the money I paid not just for it, but for the PS2 I bought pretty much for the expressed reason of playing this game.  I wish and wish TDK would come out with sequels for the Hovertanks and especially the Cyclones, but I'm not sure it'll happen.  Even better would be a game where you could do all three.  How much fun would it be to blast Invid with a Veritech?  Or Battlepods with a Hovertank?  The sky's the limit.

"Stranger's Wrath" is a very original shoot-em-up game which also has mild puzzle and strategic elements.  You control The Stranger, a mysterious bounty hunter who wields a crossbow with unique ammunition: little animals that you find hopping around dusty canyons and remote valleys.  Each of the ten or so kinds of animal ammunition has a different effect, such as distracting, stunning, or blowing up your enemies.  They're all pretty cute and some even make comments to you as they sit on your crossbow while you're stalking bad guys.In "Stranger's Wrath" you're mostly accepting missions from townsfolk to capture bandits who are kidnapping, stealing and otherwise terrorizing the local citizens.  A typical mission involves infiltrating an enemy compound, killing or capturing all of the henchmen, and then cornering and nabbing the boss at the heart of his lair.  Each enemy can either be killed or captured (and put in your bottomless bag of enemies).  Capturing is more difficult (especially in the case of the bosses) but nets you a more lucrative reward from the townspeople.  You can buy a few items in town which give you minor upgrades, but mostly you play with the Stranger you start out with, getting access to new sorts of ammunition as you advance through the early missions.The graphics are pretty good in "Stranger's Wrath".  A lot of the game is set in an Old West environment, and you can practically taste the dust when you're in the tired old frontier towns.  Some of the bosses' lairs are interestingly convoluted industrial complexes, and the outdoor environments are sometimes lush and pretty.  The sound effects are a satisfying collection of thunks, squeals and pings.  The voice work is over-the-top and cartoonish, which befits this funny and sometimes silly game.I do have a few complaints.  One is that the developers didn't implement a "difficult" setting, which means there isn't much incentive to replay the game -- I sold it as soon as I finished it.  Otherwise I would have replayed the game at least part of the way through to see if it improved with more challenging enemies.Another gripe is that while the game seems like it should be good for kids, with its cute ammunition and variety of amusing animal-ish characters, there is some swearing in the game that contrasts with the rest of the cartoony environment.Still, I enjoyed "Stranger's Wrath" and it was satisfying to finish it.  Invading enemy compounds and experimenting with different combinations of ammo is fun, the story and setting are odd but worth experiencing, and the game is different enough from every other shooter to make it a worthwhile play.
Nearly 4 years since this game was released, and it's still so unique and fun.  Hubby and I haven't gotten around to buying an Xbox 360 yet, so I was looking for games for our regular old Xbox.  I ended up buying Oddworld Stranger's Wrath used in 2006, and it's one of our favorite games.  I bought it for myself, but my husband has played it through at least twice.  It gets brought out every year to be played again, it seems.The live ammo fits in with this game so well, and I haven't gotten tired of the Chippunks telling Stranger that he's got something hanging from his nose.  My two favorite weapons of choice are laying traps with the Fuzzles, and rapid firing the Stingbees like a machine gun.  Sniping with the Wasps is pretty fun, too.The character of Stranger is so.... Clint Eastwood, I guess you could say.  Tough, and doesn't say much.When it comes time to get an Xbox 360, I have a feeling we'll keep the old Xbox around just so we can play Stranger's Wrath again.
The first thing you notice when this game begins are the incredible graphics. They profoundly showcase the capabilities of the XBOX. no matter how chaotic the screen becomes, frame rates never miss a beat. The draw distances are also incredible. Bushes and shrubs are visable form across a lake or valley. This western themed universe is supremely well pulled off with the efforts of artistically  talented Lorne Lanning and crew. At times I explored and hiked around simply for the sake of seeing the world.The sound is just as good as the graphics. Dolby surround compliments the graphics dynamically. Sound effects are crisp and clear. The ambient sounds of the environments are aslo very well done, from lapping river currents to snapping machine gun fire. Voiceovers are fun and nicely performed, though at times it can be difficult to understand Stranger.Stranger's wrath uses some well implemented tools to keep the game interesting. The game functions as a normal FPS and seamlessly switches to third person at the touch of a button allowing  the player to run and fight hand to hand. During First person,  Stranger uses a double barrel crossbow which fires live creatures that you must often catch to use. This feature is novel and allows a huge deal of replay value as you find different combos to better bounty your prey.Stranger's job through most of the game will be to bounty outlaws. Obviously you'll be paid more to bring them in alive than dead. Bringing a boss in alive is a test in patience and at some points seems almost impossible. However, due to character development, Stranger will not bounty hunt the entire game. His chracter becomes more and more interesting and in Oddworld fashion, he is charged with the task of saving the world.If this is what Oddworld Inhabitants can do now, future projects will be highly anticipated.Pros:Great graphics and sound, very high replay, excellent character development and novel approach to "live ammo"Cons:Can seem linear, very hard to bounty bosses alive
Fifteen years ago Peter Senge wrote a book called "The FIfth Discipline."  It depicts the essentials of "systems thinking" and informs us that unless we think in terms of complex interactive systems, we run the risk of creating unwanted outcomes.  All of life is about "side effects."The creators of the original Sim City had this very much in mind.  In this game, while there are robust graphics, there is no intent to have us do "virtual reality."  In fact, it is about as far away from "FPS" gaming as you could imagine.The lessons taught are depicted in other reviews here;  perhaps the most important one, though, is that everything is interdependent.  There is no decision here without a series of good and bad consequences (unless you cheat).  The learning value is enormous;  I hope that this important goal is not forgotten in further developments of this great game - which, by the way, is sort of overdue!!

One of my favorite Xbox games along with ESPN NBABasketball 2k4. I really don't think a NFL game canget much better than this. There is nothing likeplaying a franchise mode in the NFL Madden. Youhave what seems to be unlimited create playersand it sure helps in NFL Madden. And you havethe ownership mode. Is there really any reasonto play any other mode?? You control the cap, theparking prices, food etc..... You add things tothe stadiums to help draw fans and you can evenmove the franchise(Which really isn't a good ideauntil you have played several seasons) to otherlocations to draw better crowds.The action is really good and pretty realistic. Ihaven't seen all this 30 sack nonsense that oneposter claimed. Sure the offensive line strugglesto block at times, but that's why you need good WR'sto make plays in a hurry. Also, having good TE'sseems to help. Also, to help the offensive strugglesI get a moble QB as you do sort of seem like a sittingduck with a Kerry Collins or Kurt Warner as a QB.I like that you can create a good deep playbook. Tobe honest, I'm a playaction pass type of guy. I loveto use the run to set up the pass and there is alotof plays that fits my desire. One thing that bothersme is that the computer doesn't use the running gamevery well. They often abandon in it favor of the passwhich results in alot of sacks and unbalanced passingstats.I would suggest this game to any NFL gamers and afterthis one you probably will not need to buy another NFLgame for a long time. Just too much fun with the ownermode and the spring training mode.

Long ago in ancient Greece where gods, sorcery and demons roamed there lived an ex-sparta named Kratos (Voiced by TC Carson) who was a living breathing slaughterhouse that made a deal with the god of war known as Ares (Voiced by Steve Blum) who made him slaughter his own wife and daughter thus he forever barred ashes on his skin from them magically forever. Now the time has came as the other gods like Zeus (voiced by Paul Eigin) are furious about what Ares is doing in Athens causing destruction and mayhem as they sent out Kratos to find Pandora's box in a way to destroy him as he must face other enemies on his way.co-starring the voices of Linda Hunt as the narrator and Rob Paulsen, this is the ultimate Playstation 2 adventure ever conceived. This brilliant mix of fantasy, slash-and-hack and action-adventure is a great combo for this game and has been a groundbreaker since 2005 when it debuted on the PS2. The game has originally in the gameplay and the story is obviously influenced by Greek mythology as if this was influenced by 1981's classic "Clash of the Titans" but with a fresh approach.  There are challenges that you must solve that aren't too hard at times and the visuals on the game characters are just incredible. There is some brief nudity and tons of graphic gory violence like ripping harpies apart with your blades as it's no kids game, there are other weapons you can use especially magic and tons of surpises. A must play game for any hardcore gamer!

God of War is amazing! Everything is perfect about it, the story line is great, the intricate puzzles make this action-adventure game even better. All of the ancient greek mythology gods and monsters are in this, such as hydra, minotars, ares, zeus, athena, and much, much more. The hacking and slashing and magical powers along with awesome combos maks God of War an excellant game to replay over and over again.

A long time ago I picked up a role-playing game at Gen Con titled "Abyss" which was a reimagining of "Dante's Inferno" on steroids. It was gloriously violent, decadent, and imaginative.  When the Open Game License was released for Dungeons & Dragons came out, I was convinced this was the chance for "Abyss" to triumphantly return and, after tracking down the license holder and a publisher, wrote an entire book for the game.  But then the 4th Edition of D&D; was released and the publisher's interest waned. "Dante's Inferno," the video game by Visceral Games, is what I imagine that tabletop game would have looked like.When I completed my manuscript I sent it to my cousin, arenowned scholar)on "Dante's Inferno."  He demurred criticism, explaining that he had never played a video game before (it was a tabletop game remember) but that he appreciated the effort.  I imagine that's the response most people familiar with Dante Alighieri's "The Divine Comedy" will feel about this game: it's not very accurate, but if the kids are interested in literature that's a good thing, right?In the video game, Dante Alighieri (Graham McTavish) is transformed from an Italian poet to a Templar Knight on the Third Crusade. A deeply flawed warrior, he manages to break his vow to Beatrice (Vanessa Branch) before slaughtering Muslim prisoners of war at the city of Acre.  Sin and death surrounds Dante, from his doomed fellow crusader and brother-in-law Francesco (Tom Tate) to his brutal father Alighiero (JB Blanc) to his forlorn mother Bella (Pollyana McIntosh).  Dante's disillusionment is central to the belief that as a Templar his soul is untouched by the murders he commits - it is a credit to "Dante's Inferno" that it takes on such weighty matters as the Papal Bull of the Crusade. But Dante is one tough mother, so when he is stabbed in the back and death comes for him, Dante wrestles the Geiger-like scythe from him and proceeds on a quest to return to Beatrice...only to discover that Satan has absconded with her soul into hell.  Thus begins Dante's descent, accompanied only by the poet Virgil (Bart McCarthy).And that's the part we've all been waiting for: fighting in literature's most infamous hellscape. The nine circles of hell are lovingly (hatefully?) inspired by Hieronymous Bosch and other medieval artists: ferrying with Charon, battling Minos, resisting Cleopatra, slaying the many-mouthed Cerberus, facing his father's greed, and overcoming the gigantic fire demon Phlegyas.It's impossible not to learn about the original text by playing "Dante's Inferno" - a quote flies at you every time you die.  There are a variety of damned souls throughout that can be saved or condemned through mini-games which in turn gives you new powers, all of them drawn from the poem.  You can't help but admire a game that's willing to teach you a piece of classic literature even as you beat it up.There are a lot of flourishes in "Dante's Inferno" that have nothing to do with the poem and everything to do with its predecessors, "Devil May Cry" and "God of War," from the big honking scythe to the fact that Dante can fight for up to ten seconds in mid-air, from the completely unnecessary tassels that dangle from his arms to the power-ups that reward you for button mashing.  This is a game where strategy is not so much rewarded as beaten out of you. And yet "Dante's Inferno" is also a jumping, puzzling game, brutally uncompromising in sending Dante to his doom.  The medium difficulty is just about right for fighting but makes many of the other challenges too hard; the easy setting makes the various puzzles surmountable but the fighting too easy.By the sixth circle the creative team behind "Dante's Inferno" seems to have run out of steam.  Whereas in the previous circles we were gifted with whirling two-headed demons that spilled gold, corrupt infants with blades for hands, moaning temptresses with tentacles unfurling from their abdomens, and shuddering behemoths of disgusting filth, the sixth circle just starts repeating itself.  We get horned demons, then horned demons with axe and shield, and then horned demons with wings and two swords that can turn into flames.  The eighth circle with its ten "bolgie" is the worst, as a narrator explains the sinners and sins rather than actually showing them - after spending hours with wailing corpses flailing, boiling, and skewered, it's obvious the design team ran out of ideas and budget. Things don't pick up again until the last circle, when you face down Satan himself.  Compared to earlier battles, the final fight was a cakewalk.The end of "Dante's Inferno" isn't the end of course - in the game or in the poem - but it will be interesting to see if Visceral Games can make Purgatory just as compelling.
I have played some of the top rated games like Okami on the ps2, Resident evil 4, on the ps2, and Alien vs predator 2 on the pc.  This one has got to be the best out of all the ones I have listed. This game was awarded 2005 game of the year and I can see why. The graphics are the best I have seen on the ps2. It is kind of like  watching a movie. You play Kratos, who has to defeat the God of war, Ares. It is an epic quest that will reveal kratos dark past and the future. You fight different kinds of mythological creatures. The undead legionaire is a reanimated souls trained by Ares. The hydra is a snake-like beast that likes to terrorize the ships on the Aegean Sea. The Minotaur is a bloodthirsty creature that is half-man half bull. You even fight a cyclops that is a one-eyed behemoth. The gorgon was once a woman with long hair and was punished by Athena and was transformed into a snake-like creature and the hair was transformed into snakes. These are some of the creatures you will fight in the game. It has a lot of unlockable stuff when you beat the game like different costumes. It has an easter egg and it is a number you call 1-888-447-5594 when you break open the statues of a minotaur and Ares at the end of the game. It is only a free call in the U.S. and Canada. Another one is 1-800-613-8840. If you have not bought this game, go buy it now. You won't regret buying it.

Fans of the God of War franchise will be happy to find that both God of War 1&2 are now both on one single disc for the Playstation 3. Both God of War and God of War 2 were a couple of the most succesful games on the Playstation 2, taking place during the times of Greek Mythology. A man named Kratos is on a revenge quest to destroy the gods who have betrayed him. Weilding the dual blades chained to his arms, Kratos faces down hoardes of Mythological beasts such as the minotaur, the gorgons, Chimeras, and many others. These are very gory however, and should never be played by young children, teens and adults only. This game is a definite buy for any fan of God of War, or any Ps3 owner interested in the games.

Buffy The Vampire SlayerYou can see why Electronic Arts has turned the cult TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer into a game - the show is a confection of implausible plot-lines, undead creatures and superhuman martial arts.The result is a third person action-adventure game, hugely influenced by the Tomb Raider series. The gameplay consists of beat-'em-up vampire-kicking action, interspersed with the odd puzzle-solving sequence. What makes it a must for Xbox owners is its sheer authenticity: virtual Buffy really does look like Sarah Michelle Gellar, and spouts the same lame Valley Girl one-liners. The control system also shines - it manages to avoid Tomb Raider's fiddliness, yet as you progress through the game, you accumulate a huge amounts of satisfying special moves.Mind you, the basic ability to drive stakes, mops and broom handles through the hearts of vampires is surprisingly cathartic in itself.Decent graphics, seamless construction of levels in which the plot unfolds plausibly and cameo appearances from Buffy's partners in undead-bashing add up to a game in which you really do feel in control of Buffy - a popular fantasy among TV-watchers, one suspects.Buffy The Vampire Slayer has no glaring flaws and is a must for Xbox owners in general, let alone fans of the TV series. One of the best Xbox games!

For me, the game is thorroughly entertaining and follows many of the characters to a &quot;T&quot;, including Angel and Cordelia as the were in Season Three of Buffy, with Angel being Buffy's lover, and Cordelia contstantly trying to underplay Buffy's heroics. The characters even look like the actual characters as played by SMG, Allison Hannigan and the others, in almost an earily realistic way. The characters lines are smooth and very realistic, making the characters the most realistic looking characters in video games to date.What's the game about? Well, in assuning that you're somewhat vaguely familiar with Buffy, (and shame if you're not) two old enemies of Buffy's return; Spike (before he and Dru broke up, and before the leash was put on Spike) and the Master(who was killed in the season 1 finale). It seems as though the Master is using Spike to help him pick up right where the Master left off...on trying to bring Hell to Earth, and Buffy must go on a quest to stop the Master, and eventually saved the Earth from Hell...again.Of course, all of the witty banter and insults that were popular in the series are in the game, and there are tons of weapons that Buffy can use, including a water gun that squirts both Holy Water and Hellfire, a razor-sharp blade that can be either a hand-held weapon or a boomerang, but nothing beats a good old stake through the heart. Of course you can just use the very elements around you to kill the demons, my favorite is kicking a vampire against an overturned table, or a oil drum that automatically explodes when broken.Of course, Spike and the Master aren't the only vampires who are in the game. There is an endless army of vampires and demons, demon dogs, flesh eating spiders and other things that make Buffy say &quot;gross&quot;.I'm hoping that they put out a sequel to the game in time for next fall, maybe next time using characters from the later seasons, as I sadly missed Dawn and Anya in the game.

When I got an Xbox this past Christmas, the game I wanted most was none other than Buffy The Vampire Slayer. A game which is based on a tv show starring Sarah Michelle Gellar that's based on a movie starring Kristy Swanson. However, when playing the game, YOU become the star. I found myself imediately drawn to this concept and when I began playing the game, it was better than I had imagined!Easy to use controls let you move around and explore Buffy's world to it's fullest. Whether you're jumping off of a cliff, opening up a door, fighting for your life or interacting with other characters, game play has never been made so simple.The fighting style of the game is also easy to learn. Unlike many other fighting games where the combos are so intricate and complicated, these combos are made simple just by holding down certain buttons that make Buffy's moves deadly.The graphics on this game are so amazing, any fan of the tv show will be drooling over them. From the facial expressions of the vampires (squinty eyes, wrinkled face, pointy and blood dripping teeth) to a simple walk in the cemetary (where the moon casts detailed shadows of trees onto the ground), the sights will leave you in awe.The sound to me is what's most impressive. Granted, I have my Xbox hooked up to some kick ... speakers, but you can tell just how much thought was put into this game just by turning up the volume. Obviously, there's the repetitious, but humorous  voice overs provided by the stars of the show (SMG, Nicholas Brenden, Alyson Hannigan, Charisma Carpenter, David Boreanaz, Anthony Stewart Head, James Marsters and more), but what you'll really wanna sink your teeth into are the sound effects.Such ear candy includes Buffy grunting and panting as she jumps or falls, in some parts you can hear the sound of her flesh sliding against steel as she "shimmies" across poles from one rooftop to another, the deep throated growlings of a vampire/demon continuously give the game it's creepy vibe and listening to the eerie and unsettling sounds of children laughing while your down in the dark underneath the church may give you more than just the wigs.Basically, this game is a ten star game. I got it about two weeks ago and I've almost got it completed. Not to say this game doesn't have it's challenges, I just love it so much I've been playing non stop.I really enjoy being in Buffy's world and becoming the slayer. I've been waiting for a Buffy game way back since the Sega Dreamcast was making it. All I can say is thst it is well worth the wait. You won't believe how good it is. All I could ask for after this is a nice sequel. One that takes place in the tv show's present where Buffy is taking on the first evil who can shape shift into anyone that's dead including past baddies such as Drusilla, The Mayor, Adam and Glory. Also, it would be really fun to be able to interact with other characters such as Joyce Summers, Faith, Tara, Anya, Jonathan, Riley, Dawn and those 3 creepy bad guys from the Emmy nominated "Hush" episode.

Okay, I'm not a fan of Buffy and here's why. I am a fan of parapsychology. The study of ghosts, and vampires, and other mythological monstrosities has been an interest of mine since I was a child. Vampires are my favorite monsters because when used correctly they can be a very deep and compelling monster, on that serves as a symbol for what we as a society have become.My book shelves are jam packed full of vampire literature, from the works of Bram Stoker to the great works of Anne Rice, to the not so good, but still kind of fun work of Laurell K. Hamilton, to the masterpiece of storytelling that is Vampire: The Masquerade, and its many companion game books, or novels based therein, to Hunter: The Reckoning, and so on. I'm no stranger to vampire mythology, both from a modern, and a historical aspect.It is because of my background in this field that I have always detested Buffy, and their portrayal of vampires. Vampires do not lack a soul. If you take away the soul you take away the vampire's meaning for existence, and usefulness in a good story. They become wallpaper for action flick, and nothing more.I have only watched a few episodes of Buffy, and no offense to Buffy fans the show is too juvenile for my tastes. However, I'm still looking for a must have title to sit next to Hunter: the Reckoning in my XBox collection. This game may very well end up being that lucky title. This game does almost everything right.The control and camera scheme is very Soul Reaver like. This made it very easy for me to get into the groove of the game play. My only complaint is that the combat seems a bit simplistic. I find myself kicking my way through out the baddies and the punching seems pretty much ineffective, plus I don't want to risk breaking the sharp objects Buffy can carry.Another minor complain is the dialogue. Since I'm not a fan of Buffy the bad puns are big time groaners. Although she does have a few good ones, a lot of the puns are just bad. There's also a lot of repeated lines throughout the game play that are repeated so much it gets annoying. It's tempting to hit the mute and leave it on mute until the next cut scene.The lack of variety to the vampire models is also a complaint. How many times do I have to kill that guy/girl? The Xbox could have easily handled a larger variety of models. The zombies of Nintendo/Capcom's Resident Evil had a great deal of variety. There were very few zombies that looked identical to each other. More variety along these lines would have been nice for the vampire bad guys.Graphically, Buffy falls somewhere between Eternal Darkness, and Resident Evil. It is step up in character models, but Eternal Darkness was sharper and crisper, still it is impressive graphically, but not as impressive as Resident Evil. Some of the characters don't look as good as others. Buffy and Spike look great, as does her mentor whose name slips me. Xander is okay, as is willow, but whoever that other cheerleader is (the brunette) looks terrible. Again, the models look better than Eternal Darkness, but ED is sharper and crisper, but the game is still not quite on par with RE. I guess Capcom raised the bar unreasonably high, as critics like myself will always compare horror titles to RE.Definitely a game to buy, I think. But it may not be for all non-Buffy fans. The dialogue can get quite tacky.

This is a great game...it definately brought something a little different to the table. It is somewhat similar to GTA. Here are some of the differences I foundgetaway pros1. the story line is more suspenseful thus making it more interesting that GTA2. The graphics is much better3. The jamaican accents are real(thank god)4. you can escape the cops5. The cops and some bad guys will give up if you hold one of theirs as hostage.getaway cons1. you are only limited to only 3 types of weapons2. There are no chopper, bikes or planes3. Cheat codes are ...4. not as entertaining as GTA (vice city)I guess the ultimate game would be a cross between vice city, getaway and hitman

The Getaway, of course, has been compared to the GTA series since it came out. But the truth is, it's not even close to it. It is much more realistic, with no health meter and it doesn't tell you how much ammo you have. It is extremely realistic. It takes place in London, and the city is done amazingly, right down to the last shanty, and it's huge. It takes forever to get from one end to the other.The game starts out with you as Mark Hammond, former member of the Collins gang. You just got out of jail, but your wife gets killed and your son gets kidnapped. You go out on a quest for revenge against Charlie Jolson, criminal mastermind and the man who stole your son. You end up doing jobs for him with the promise you'll get your son back. You have twelve missions with Mark, then you go on to....Frank Carter. A vigilante cop, also obsessed with nicking Charlie Jolson. You have twelve missions with him too, and at the end, Frank and Mark's stories intertwine and they end up working together to rescue Mark's son and bring down CharlieThis game is awesome. It is so realistic and very worth it to buy, but I hear its not a good idea to get the second istallment, Black Monday. But the first one is great. Highly suggested

Non-linear gameplay in Liberty City is an extrememly fun and rewarding gameplay experience.  There's no question that when this came out in stores it was everyone's favorite game.  Mafia, Columbian Cartels, and Triads were some of the main gangs that inhabited the streets.  There's almost nothing about this game that isn't challenging except stealing cars when there aren't any cops around.  This game is still fun, but if you've played Vice City or San Andreas before this, than it's not that ammusing.

There's almost nothing about this game that isn't challenging except stealing cars when there aren't any cops around.  This game is still fun, but if you've played Vice City or San Andreas before this, than it's not that ammusing.
I couldn't stop playing.  I was in the mood for a short campaign, but I happily sank 50 hours into this baby.  The main missions weren't that great, but the hit missions and favors made up for that.  The free form overworld play was the greatest.  I loved taking over all the fronts, rackets, warehouses, hubs, and compounds.  Early on, the bank heists and racket truck jacking was a scream.  I could still play for several more hours dynamiting the final safes, holding up all the banks at once, getting all the execution styles on gangsters and crooked cops, and robbing the sewer boys and the gang near the former Cuneo compound.  So much to do in this game, and all of it is fun.  The controls for shooting, driving, and hand to hand combat were superb.  So the graphics weren't great, not a big concern for me.
Even after playing Vice City long before I finally picked up a copy of GTAIII, I can say that I was thoroughly amazed!  Every angle and aspect of the game is nearly perfect, and in many ways I believe GTA III to be better than its amazing follower, Vice City. For one thing, the city, in my opinion, is better, and the lights and sounds will surely dazzle any sane gamer. On the downside, GTAIII is not as long and not as "amazing" as Vice City. However, any gamer should treat this game with respect, for it spanned a host of sequels, not just GTA Vice City, but Mafia and The Getaway as well. GTA III does it better than any of them. For any person who does not know the layout of the GTA games, it takes place in a freely-roamed city. There are missions from many colorful characters throughout, but now you are a criminal in an expansive city. For any FPS lovers, there are no 007 missions where you just go around shooting. This is a new kind of game, a kind where you can run around hijacking any car off of the street and killing whoever you may want to. Of course, there is much more to GTA games than just that, and any gamer will be entertained for hours by this "mafioso masterpiece!"-Maxim. My rating-10!

Why compare this game to Mozart? They are the same:  Genius in Simplicity.I loved this game.  I am actually surprised that even more people have not played it.  It has the highest rating ever from PC Gamer (98%).  Think about that:  Alpha Centauri is 2% away from being considered The Perfect Game.Why? Strategy that is detailed but intuitive.  Diplomacy that is believable and matters.  Game balance.  A fun storyline.  An intelligent AI that does not have to cheat to win.But by far my favorite part of the game is the technology aspect of the game.  Each new future technology (some truly vague) is introduced with a sound byte from a faction leader, but more important is WHAT these leaders say. Philosophy, religion, literature, hard science, Emmanuel Kant, Aristotle, even Military Cadences are used to provide atmosphere to the game.  This is a game that respects the gameplayer's intelligence.  Additionally, the future technology tree has been well researched.  Just go to the back of the well-produced Alpha Centuari manual to see the vast bibliography of Science Textbooks, Hard Science Fiction (Think Stanley Kubrik's 2001) and Soft Science Fiction (Think Star Wars or Star Trek) that the game draws influence from.  I have a PhD in Molecular biology, and I must endorse the technology tree as an excellent model for speculating how humanity's future knowledge-base may be represented. Particularly interesting is how different civilizations are based on faction instead of nationality.  However, nationalistic stereotypes are represented.  The communist/socialist faction is represented by Chairman Yang (Chinese).  The Gaia mentality is represetned by Lady Dierdre Skye (Celtic/Irish).  The University faction is represented by a Russian Scientist (Academician Prokhor Zakharov), and the UN peacekeeping faction by a Ghandi-like figure in Commissioner Pravin Lal.  There are others, to be sure, but these are the most egregious.Regardless, the game is an outstanding mix of fun, a stytle of gameplay that does not require excessive detail to be considered intelligent, great presentation values, and an overall attention to polish even in the smallest details.  There is precious little that could be changed in this game.  To quote Salieri describing Mozart's music, &quot;Displace one note and there would be diminishment. Displace one phrase, and the structure would fall.&quot;

I know this is a game that came out before the World Cup, but don't think it came out after the World Cup, Hwang Sun Hong is the only star player for Korea, Woon Jae Lee has only a rating of 64, the bets players are Hwang Sun Hong 80, Kim Byung Ji 80, Ki -Hyeon Seol79, Chun Soo Lee 78, and Jin Cheul Choi 76.  Only official Korean chant is Ee-ku-ra, which means win, but thats it, no Taehanminguk, O Korea, and etc.  For you Fifa fans, they have up to 42 teams not ounting All American, All Asia, All Europe and etc.  They go as far as to Senegal!  The game also is way too easy, if you try to win you score too much, if you try to keep the score fairly close like 1 to 0 you give up too many goals and your palyers are too tired, save your money and get Fifa 2003

I really enjoy this game.  There are seven fractions that all broke up when they landed on the planet.  You must choose to represent one.  There are several changes that this game made along with improvement, A.) There  is now a concel that all the countries make up.  When issues arive they all  go to meet on the issue.  You can run for planetary governew where you are  essianly the leader of union.  I really enjoy this and it opens up the  option for a diplomatic victory.  B.) You now have boarders.  This is  simple where your city limits are.  An improvement for a possible AC2 would  be that you can move the boarders by notation and not but building a city.The one thing I did not like about this game was the tech tree.  I never  felt like I was in charge.  Only having seven diffrent fractions,  (countries) may seem like a down fall but if you stick with one fraction  you will become bitter rivals with other fractions.I would highly  recommend this game.  There is the enivitable question of wiether it is  better than Civ2.  That of course is tough compition but considering that  Civ2 came out a few years ago AC was able to update some parts.  I think AC  has a slight egde but CIV2 was more impressive for its time.

Get to it!  Pen up some smooth-hitting flows because that li'l freestyling pup from his 1997 debut has returned to the PS2!  Togged up in his claret beanie, some big ol' baggy pants, and a pair of funky red shoes, Parappa The Rappa must prevent his hometown from being dominated by the infamous Noodle Gang!  Suffusing burger joints with their noodles, the folks at Rappa's town fight back to regain their beloved, high-in-saturated-fat, heart-attack-causing cow patties.  Okay, so the third story in the series is not as charming as the first lovey-dovey one, but hey, the reasons why so many have hailed the first Parappa game as a brazen title is completely unbroken third time around (including Um Jammy Lammy).  Parappa The Rappa 2 simply rocks despite its lack of reconstruction or wave of advancement to its genre.The first one in the series was a landmark of beaming personality with its vivacious character designs and dainty backgrounds.  Its retrospective of colors and paper-thin models  were something to stare upon and talk about.  Parappa the Rappa 2 looks almost indistinguishably equal as the first but better.  Reintroducing all the attitude along with spiffier character visuals, the game runs smoother and juicier with a rich audio eminence.  Parappa's transposable charm is all rendered in the graphical ambiance as with the affluent scenarios found throughout.Although fairly undersized in length, with only eight levels, Parappa The Rappa 2 tenders what previous attempts have bided.  The saying, "if it ain't broken don't fix it," perfectly suits the nature of this game.  Basically, the player must tap in specific buttons in a rhythm in simon-says style.  Several buttons will appear on the screen and its up to the player to correctly hit the buttons displayed or commanded.  At the right bottom of the screen, the player's rating level determines how well the player is performing.  Obviously getting a good rating will advance players onto the proceeding stage.  The rating ranges from the lowest of "Awful"  to "Cool" as the best groove.  Should the player mess up on the button tapping, his rating will plunge from "Good" to "Bad" and finally "Awful."  Perfectly clocked in rhymes will have the player ascending on his rating.  If the player wishes to reach "Cool," then he must freestyle in between the commands given on screen by pushing any button as long as it goes with the flow and does not interfere with imperative commands.  Offering a two player battle mode and loads of button-smashing humor, Parappa The Rappa 2 doesn't shed anything quite new, but casts all the fun from as a splendid pastime.Of all the elements in Parappa The Rappa 2, the return of imaginative characters and their remarkable voice-overs is unsurpassed.  The music throughout the game drifts like a brilliant rap, presenting an appealing and positively inane (in a good way) tunes.In short, Parappa The Rappa 2's abrupt end left me ravenous for much more play.  Quite possible to be finished in one sitting, the game just begs for additional levels and challenge.  The overall quality in the game gleams, shimmers, shines, and what not, but the quantity of the game is the weakest constituent.  Even with its two player battle of the best freestyling spin-off, Parappa The Rappa 2's biggest quibble is the question of buying or renting it.  But don't let its shortage cloud your judgment because the game is just one of those games that'll you find yourself visiting over and over.  Though, next time around, Sony should flesh out a solid line-up of challenges and different play modes.  Boil it down and what you have is another fantastic party game.

I'm not going to give away any plot points because this game is much better enjoyed when you don't know what to expect.  I have finished it once and am already looking forward to my next playthrough to see how different choices affect what happens.  The graphics in this game are outstanding, particularly the photo-realistic character models.  Sony used an orchestra to create the soundtrack for this game, and it is better than typed words can convey.  Think Silence of the Lambs in terms of tension being built up perfectly.  It's also in the back of your mind the whole game that you can get one of the four characters you control killed if you make bad decisions or fail to get them out of danger.  Characters are well developed and likable enough that I cared about keeping them alive, not just to get the best ending.  The game is divided into chapters and sub-chapters, and if you're unhappy with what just happened you can choose to restart from an earlier point.  You can also do so to see how each decision plays out, though I never did because it felt like cheating and largely spoils the game's huge replay value.  Knowing that your actions can and will permanently alter the course of the game and story creates incredible anxiety.This is the first time I have ever enjoyed using the six-axis controls in any game.  At one point I had a guy by the collar and decided to rough him up for information.  By shaking the controller up and down I began shaking the suspect until he talked.  For someone who is not a fan of analog sticks I was amazed by how natural their use was throughout the game.  Each action sequence consists of a button pressing/analog stick moving minigame.  While such minigames have become common and are generally starting to feel overused, every button press in Heavy Rain feels natural within the context of the action onscreen.  When running for your life you choose a direction to push and dodge obstacles accordingly.  You push buttons to punch, kick at or dodge the weapon of your assailant.  You have a window of opportunity to make the correct button presses, which changes based on the difficulty level you choose (you can change the difficulty setting at any time during the game).  Different animations result with each success or failure and accumulate during each minigame until you pass or fail it.  There are also a number of times during the game when you unexpectedly have to react with a single button press.  The only control issue I had was getting used to holding R2 to walk, then using the left stick to change direction.  After countless games where walking is done entirely with the left stick alone I spent the whole game fighting my natural instinct.  They set it up the way it is because cameras are fixed and change routinely as you move through an area.  If you simply hold R2 you'll keep moving straight, but if you fiddle with the left stick you unintentionally change direction every time there's a camera switch.  It's a small price to pay in exchange for fixed cameras that never get stuck on things or end up at bad angles.  Since spotting clues in each room is vital to the game working, Sony made the right choice here.  You can even push L1 to change cameras at almost any time, allowing you to focus on either your own character or the person you're talking to.There have been a lot of video games with much hype around them that failed to deliver, sequels that play it too safe and lack originality, and blatant clones of successful franchises.  Heavy Rain is very original, full of suspense, good writing and voice acting, nice graphics and tremendous sound that set the right atmosphere, and very good controls.  This game is why you bought a PS3 and cannot be missed.  Those blockbuster action and FPS games can wait.  Heavy Rain should be your next purchase.  You will thoroughly enjoy it, and we need to support sales of titles that dare to innovate.
Pros:+Gorgeous Graphics with some great anime cutscenes+An engrossing storyline+Really loveable characters+Easy to become acquainted with+Surprisingly large amount of customizationCons:-For those looking for innovation they won't find itThe PSP has slowly been gaining a lot of RPGs and tactical RPGs.  In late 2007 we saw the release of three Strategy RPGs in particular.  Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions, Disgaea: Afternoon of Darkness and Jeanne D'arc.  While Final Fantasy Tactics and Disgaea were two fine ports from two fine systems, Jeanne D'arc stands on its own as an original creation.  The result is a beautiful, simple SRPG that while it doesn't change the face of the genre, it's a game that manages to be fun nonetheless.The story of Joan of Arc has been told numerous times.  However, it's never quite been told like this.  That is to say the story itself mixes in Fantasy with History.  In short, any student hoping to use this game has an interactive history lesson won't find it.  On the other hand, though, the story is well told through some fantastic Anime cutscenes that are by far some of the best to grace the PSP thus far.  There are some great characters to accompany you on your travels as well.  It also helps that the game has some spectacular voice acting with French accents that aren't overdone, but aren't too tame either.  The cel shaded graphics looks absolutely astonishing as well.  The environments are enormous and detailed.  The enemies are also pretty detailed as well.  In terms of production values, Jeanne D'arc exceeds by being both artistic, and showing what the PSP is capable of doing.  It's very rare when a game does both very well, but Jeanne D'arc does.A beautiful game can't stand alone without some good gameplay to go along with it.  Luckily, Jeanne D'arc has some good gameplay too.  It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but the simplicity of the game makes it so that there is no need for overly long tutorials that plague a few other tactical RPGs.  While this can be a little annoying for those who dwelled into more complex SRPGs such as Final Fantasy Tactics and Disgaea, it does have a few traits that make it overall fun to play.  As usual, you'll control characters on a grid and there are a set of objectives.  In some missions the goal is to defeat the enemy leader while making sure a specific character doesn't fall.  In other missions it's simply to crush all the bad guys.  The game adds a twist on this as well.  You must finish the battle in a certain amount of turns or its game over.  While this is a nice twist it's hardly something that merits being included.  You'll finish most battles long before you get that warning telling you how many turns are left.Much like other SRPGs you'll have a set of commands to attack your enemies and use skills.  Unlike many SRPGs, though, the counter attack rate in Jeanne D'arc is through the roof.  The good news is that this makes the battles go faster. That may be one of the things that helps this game out.  In many SRPGs battles are slow winded and last for a long time.  In Jeanne D'arc they go relatively fast.  In between turns you'll also see enemies and allies shout things out.  For a moment this is alright, after a while it gets annoying.There are skills at work in battle.  You can equip certain skill stones to let you do things like cast healing spells or perform special attacks in battle.  Equipping skill stones doesn't just grant you abilities or status enhancements.  It's also there to raise affinity with the three spirits, Luna, Sol and Stella.  There is no one spirit greater or more powerful than another.  This works in a Rock-Paper-Scissors, fashion.  One spirit is stronger than one but weak against the other.  This puts a lot more emphasis on strategy.  Some attacks deal far more damage based on which spirit you are affiliated with.  The same thing works for your enemies.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Jeanne D'arc is that the games transformation system.  Jeanne can transform once she has enough SP.  This gives her a significant boost to her stats.  It also gives her the ability to take another turn immediately after killing an enemy.  This is great, but because of the increase in stats in some areas it makes the game unreasonably easy.  That doesn't mean the entire game itself is easy.  You'll find that in many maps you're outnumbered.  And that a mishap or two in your strategy can cost you the battle.  Jeanne D'arc may be a simple game to learn but it can be a bit tough to master.Jeanne D'arc also sounds masterful.  The soundtrack is beautifully orchestrated.  While at some points the music can be repetitive (particularly hearing the "Enemy Phase" music over and over again), it still sounds absolutely fantastic.  If there was anything holding Jeanne D'arc back, it would be the games lack of voice acting.  While you hear a lot in the animated scenes, you don't hear them that much beyond that.  It'd be nice if some of their battle callouts, for example, were screamed out.  This is a minor problem and in no way detracts from the game itself, though.Any PSP owner looking for a fun, engrossing SRPG ought to look to Jeanne D'arc.  It's incredible story, simple battle system and good use of customization and balance make it an engrossing adventure.  It may not reinvent the wheel, but that keeps the game from being a needlessly complicated endeavor.
While this is not a perfect game, it does have the distinction of being one of the most unique gaming experiences I've had, and definitely has hands down the best looking characters and facial animations in a game to date.There's that old clich&eacute;' that's always used, "it's so real it's just like watching a movie," and that's usually not the case, not even close. Heavy Rain however, lives up to that, as this is as close to an interactive movie we've had in gaming. I guess to be completely accurate, I shouldn't say Heavy Rain resembles a movie as if graphically it's photo realistic and nearly indistinguishable from a movie (although what I said about facial animations still holds true). I guess it's like a movie in terms of characters, narrative, and cinematic storytelling.This is pretty much the video game version of the Choose Your Own Adventure books. Despite what other reviewers may say, this is definitely a game of quick-time events, where you choose what happens next either by succeeding or failing at said event,  but it's done seamlessly and intuitively so as not to seem like a gimmick. I'm not the biggest fan of this type of gameplay, but what kept me intrigued was the story, which I felt was the strongest part of the game. I'm not a movie expert, but to me personally this game's story rivals the stories I've seen told in crime/mystery/drama type movies. All the characters had depth that made you care about them, and the way we go from controlling one of the four main characters to another is just like when a movie cuts from the main character to a secondary character in a different setting. I wanted to go forward to learn more, and as the game concluded, and we learned who the killer was, I was definitely surprised, but it made perfect sense. It was a motive you could believe in.  Everything fit together perfectly. Unlike a movie (or a dvd with no extra bonus features), this game has the advantage of having multiple endings, and by multiple, I'm talking double digits. But for me, once I got my one set of endings, I had NO inclination to play it again to explore other gameplay possibilities or endings. This was due to two main gameplay flaws that I was not about to subject myself to sit through again:1) The walking controls are ridiculous. There is no reason why I should have to hold down R2 to walk. As it is, if you use the left analog stick without the R2 modifier, your character basically tilts their head in that direction, allowing you to sort of move the camera that way. No, THAT should be what the modifier does; Have the analog stick move you by default, and ONLY if you choose to want to look in a direction should you have to press R2. Think about it, at any given moment,  were you doing more walking or `head tilting' in the game? In fact, did you ever head tilt other than those few moments where you're prompted to by the game with that little circular motion thing telling you to search your surroundings? Maybe once or twice right? See my point?2) Also, the walking is way too slow. It's too drawn out. I can't play through the whole game again with these slow motion walking characters. I realize this is probably a realistic pace to walk in, but since it's a game, they should've given me the option to run (how's that for the use of the R2 button eh?), or at least speed up the default walking speed. It feels like a chore to move from one spot to the next. Again, had they let you move with just the left analog stick, MAYBE this wouldn't have been as big of an issue (believe it or not, holding down R2 is actually fatiguing).3) Ok, this one isn't so much a flaw as it is personal preference I guess. With the game's environments looking as great as it did, it sure would've been nice to be able to interact with it more. At any given point, you might be in a room with some of the most detail you've seen in a game, but unable to do anything with it other than doing that damn head tilt or switching between the two default cameras to see what else there is to look at. Generally speaking, some of the button prompts you get when you walk up to an object to interact with it isn't really even an interaction at all because it's not YOU doing it. Essentially, you're just triggering a cutscene by choosing to wash your face, or picking up that object off the ground.  What I would've loved to been able to do is switch to a first-person view and look around and have fun. All those fun environments to check out in first-person: the night club, the party mansion, hec, inside of the apartments. My guess on why you couldn't do this is because these are all pre-rendered scenes, and you're not really moving a character and exploring, so much as "moving the picture to the left or right" and seeing what else is on the canvas. With it being pre-rendered, the objects you want to examine in detail simply cannot be viewed from "that angle," because there's no instance of it from that perspective. Hmmm...but then again you have those handful of levels where it's a third-person above the shoulder view, and it does feel like you have a free camera to rotate around and work with (like the police station).  Oh well, I can't explain it from a technical level, that's why I'm in school for game development :) All I know is that  these wonderful environments they created felt all too much like a movie since all I could do is WATCH IT.Again, that third and final complaint I wouldn't defend too strongly, I concede that these types of gameplay mechanics could just be a function of the kind of game it is, and that me complaining about that is like complaining that a basketball game doesn't have enough Platforming elements to it. It is what it is. Had the controls not been flawed this game would've been amazing, and had tons of replay value. But even as it is, this is unique game with a deep, engaging story, and a perfect soundtrack. Definitely a must rent, or buy it if you don't mind the control problems, or if you're really really into QTE games.
System Shock 2 is hard to categorize, because it blends several genres and styles of games so well. It's a Role-Playing First-Person Shooter Science Fiction Survival/Horror game, with some extra twists here and there. If you wished Half-Life was more like Deus Ex, or you wanted to play the more violent and scary parts of Thief with 22nd century firepower, this is the game you want to play.Though it's getting a bit dated now, this game was far enough ahead of its time to still be very playable. Where the original System Shock made history as a remarkably immersive story-driven first-person shooter, the sequel goes even further with complex character development elements usually only seen in role-playing games. The graphics scale up smoothly enough to still look impressive on today's faster, higher resolution (and higher polygon count) displays, the sound is of sufficient quality to still be just as effective as most newer, more technically advanced productions, and of course, a great story is never obsolete.Once you get into a game this immersive, you forget about the technical details that may no longer be as cutting-edge as they once were. Just turn off the lights, plug in your headphones (or surround-sound if you have it), and try to stay alive. If you happen to forget that it's just a game, this one can really scare you. Definitely not for the faint of heart.The biggest flaw in this game is that the developers just didn't have enough time to fully flesh-out and polish some of the later parts.  Certain areas are just less expansive and detailed and finely-tuned than others.  The game doesn't significantly suffer from what's missing.  It just could have been that much better.By far the most common complaint about this game is that the weapons break too fast.  Personally, I don't consider that a flaw.  I like the extra stress factor of having to keep an eye on the condition of my weapons.  Unlike most First-Person Shooters, your resources are very limited in this game.  Throughout most of the game, you will very rarely have enough ammo to stop worrying about making every shot count.  There are a limited number of weapons available, and if you keep firing one until it jams, you have to either expend other resources to fix it or deal with the fact that you have one less gun to work with.If you really don't like worrying about broken weapons, there is a way to reduce or completely disable weapon deterioration.  It's not a menu option you can switch on and off within the game, but the release notes file on the CD explains how to do it, and it's not difficult.One complaint I've heard about the end of this game is that there are two "final battles" at the end, and the second one is disappointingly easy.  I didn't feel that way because I recognized that the first final battle was the climax, and then when there was one more confrontation after that, I thought of it as more of an epilogue than a challenge.  This is something gamers just aren't used to, and the only other game I've played that had an "epilogue" after the final confrontation was Half-Life, which has been accused of having the worst ending of any game ever.  The ending of System Shock 2 isn't nearly that bad, but it can be disappointing if the relatively short final areas have left you expecting more.Unfortunately, due to the particular circumstances of the closing of the company that developed the game, Looking Glass Studios, it is very unlikely that there will ever be a third System Shock game.

This is a perfect game for people who like a very artistic, environmental, and unique game.  Most games can be decribed by referring to other games, but this one definitely stands alone.The visuals are outstanding.  The graphics almost look like they were painted onto your screen.  (If you have a TV with component inputs, it's worth getting the cabling for it for this game.)  The colors shift from soft to sharp at different points in the game, and they do a great job of drawing you into the experience.The story turns out to be an incredible part of this game.  As you hunt down these lumbering hulks, you begin to feel a sense of sympathy with some of them.  For a game to invoke any kind of emotion is quite an accomplishment.  I'd love to continue talking about the story, but I don't want to give any more away...The score works perfectly within the game.  As you approach, survey, and finally begin combat with these giants, the music changes to fit the feeling of the action.  The developers obviously put most of their efforts into creating an enveloping experience, and they succeeded.There is very little that is at all negative about the game, but I've hit a couple of points where the action gets heated and the frame rate dropped rather low.  Fortunately, they designed a rather clever workaround: if the frame rate drops, the frames start to blend together smoothly so that you don't get any kind of stuttering.The gameplay is solid, although adjusting to the controls takes some effort.  The fact that there aren't armies of meaningless enemies between you and the collossi just adds to the ambiance of the game.  The fact that you don't level up, find new weapons, gain new strengths, etc. really adds to the feeling that you are nothing but a tiny fly compared to these hulks.Overall, it is an outstanding, artistically brilliant game that really draws you in and doesn't distract from its very single-minded focus.  Add to that a brilliant score and a great sense of atmosphere, and you've got a great, unique game.
Based on the other reviews I wanted to completely finish this game before throwing out my two cents. I just finished it today so here it goes.For veterans of the SRPG genre this probably won't offer any significant challenge. However that shouldn't be a deal breaker. This game brought a lot of other elements to the table that were quite fun and engaging to play through. That being said it's a great game for beginners or casual players of SRPGS.Be prepared to read. If you just want to dive in and blow up your screen that won't be happening here. In between every battle there are cut scenes and dialogue bits that can be time consuming. I personally enjoyed it because it proved that the storytelling aspect was just as important as gameplay. While the story itself wasn't anything ground breaking it was certainly creative, solid and engaging. Cut scenes were nicely animated and voice acting was pretty spot on. The overall art direction may seem bright and fluffy but there are more than a few surprisingly morbid/disturbing points as the plot unfolds. Sound is OK- after a while you might want to go into options and turn the music down and leave the EFX vol. up.As you progress through the game new characters join your party. The characters are individually bound to a kind of weapons proficiency: sword, battle axe, dagger, bow, staff, whip, and lance. In most battles you can play anywhere from 5 to 7 characters. This gives you a wide range to play around with strategically. Along with weapons proficiency you also collect skill stones which you can later on "bind" to create more powerful stones. These stones come in 4 different flavors: Offensive abilities that use MP and are connected to each characters' weapon proficiency, Passive skills (often buffs or counters), Magic abilities (which any character can use keeping in mind that some of these skills use a lot of MP), and finally inherent passive skills which are again bound to a characters' weapon proficiency that often add a boost of some kind when equipped. Ultimately each character will be allowed to equip up to 6 skill stones and after you've collected or created a good chunk of these stones you have a surprisingly large palette for customizing each character every round before battle.Along with skill stones is a feature that implements "spirit affinity"- sol, luna, and stella. It seems a little complicated at first and certainly isn't crucial to pay much attention to until further into the game. It essentially works, as many people have said, as a sort of "rock, paper, scissors" dynamic wherein each affinity has a strength and weakness to a corresponding affinity (luna is stronger over sol but weak against stella). The game provides tutorials on how to use this to your advantage in battle. Each affinity will come in the form of a skill stone (passive) that you can equip in any combination onto each character based on the enemies' affinities with the objective of making your party just a little bit stronger in both offense and defense. Anyhow, it's an interesting concept that misses the mark just a little bit for me but nonetheless can be a huge factor in whether or not your battles last a long time or are over more quickly.On the topic of battle length, YES there is a round limit implementation. If you play smart and don't screw around this will never be an issue. From start to finish I never once had to replay a battle because I exceeded the round limit. Some people have complained that this is a cock block to grinding characters or whatever- as the game progresses it will offer "Free Combat" areas on the map which although still have a round limit are excellent opportunities to grind your heart out or play with group and skill combinations. I personally will spend a lot of time doing this and I think it took some of the challenge out of the game in later levels because I turned a lot of my group into absolute beasts. Also there are skill stones that will give a character extra EXP points if you find you have some folks lagging behind. Anyhow, it's up to you, just sayin' the option is there.Oh and the armlets. The storyline will explain how these came to be, why they exist and how to use them. They are essentially worn by only a few and, when "charged" (similar to MP) can be used during a battle for a few rounds to sortof hulk out a character. While it was an important element for the storyline, the actual feature may have been overkill with the skill stones and spirit affinities- sometimes it makes things altogether too easy. I didn't use these very much and the game would have no doubt been a lot more challenging without the option.Despite there being a fairly large party of players at your disposal there were only one or two I didn't feel some kind of connection to. Throughout battles and cut scenes and everything everyone seems to have something to say or some little dialogue bubble that pops up that gives you a sense of who they are. One person is a little whiny and meek (while still being a badass), one is cocky and flirtatious, one is a meat head, etc... I thought this was pretty impressive considering some games just completely ignore these peripheral characters that are there the entire time.Alright so in a nutshell-PROS:- The story probably won't really blow your hair back but it's solid and unassuming. And if you have trouble delineating between the factual history of St. Joan and a fantasy interpretation involving beasts, demons and dark elves then I'm not really sure what to say to you.- Despite it straying a bit from traditional skill leveling and character customization, JoA gives you plenty to play around with in a unique (but not earth shattering) format as well as a variety of characters.- In terms of handheld titles, this is an easy one to pick up and play for short bits of time here and there. You have the option of both a hard save in between battles and quicksave during battles.- It's like ocular candy in both presentation and animated cut scenes.- Overall difficulty level is perfect for beginners of SRPGS and would probably be considered a "light read" for veterans.- At this point JoA costs, what, like $5 ?CONS:- Some of the gameplay elements are creative but fall a little short in providing more balance to strategy- Music can become a little repetitive- Final boss battle felt more like a wet fart than a final battle.Yea, just go get it. It's a solid game. I've never played a "perfect" game but this one was just confident and fun. It's cheap and if you even remotely are a fan of this genre you will probably like it at least enough to be worth the cost.
It's a shame that a game that does so much right in so many unique and unprecedented ways should ultimately drop the ball so entirely with the story. WIth a game like Heavy Rain, you can't excuse a mediocre plot like you could with a more action oriented title; the story is really essential. This isn't to say that the experience isn't effectively dramatic. The mood is encompassing, and you certainly feel drawn into the world.The problem really comes down to the assembly of the story, and I'll offer up my complaints as best I can without giving away spoilers. Sure, it's a huge feat to have a branching, "living" story like this, wherein your actions determine the outcome of events. Nonetheless, the biggest complaints involve inexcusable plot holes. There's red herrings that simple get abandoned rather than explained away, and there's a handful of revelations that are frankly cheap and nonsensical.It really is a shame, because despite this huge irritation, I still loved the game. I would still highly recommend it to a stranger on the street, but if you're even mildly paying attention, the actual plot will fail you. This had the potential to be something classic; something we could call the first "The Silence of the Lambs" in gaming. The sloppy and occasionally stupid writing will prevent it from ever achieving that accolade though. Never the less, it's incredible, beautiful, unique, and probably unlike anything you've ever played before. This game will be remembered as a pioneering and bold new step in video games, but I can only anticipate that the games it will influence will pull off the narrative construction far better, and it will be hard to look back and excuse this game by comparison. In some ways it's a revelation, but I can't say it's a classic.

Ok, I'm going to be honest.  I LOVED the first Uncharted, and I actually bought it used, because well it was cheap, and I never really heard of it.  Well, that game was AWESOME!!  Hands down one of the best games I've played in a LONG TIME.  Second game came out, and I want it, but wanted to save money and buy it used again.  Well, I just happen to hear, that sales are not as great as they publishers hoped, so I'm calling out to all gamers who buy used games, and not buy this game used!!  BUY IT NEW!  If they make a Near Perfect game, and it doesn't sell well we got no one to blame but ourselves when we get junk games.  I got caught in the hype and bought Modern Warfare 2, and well, I still haven't beat the game, and the story line, wellll.. sucked.  It sells like hotcakes!  Not saying, it's a bad game, but all I'm saying is Uncharted 2 not only deserves  to sell a trillion games, but it earned it from all the hard work they put into it.  I'm BUYING new tomorrow, and I hope that other people will too.  Pass this one if you want, but seriously, don't you want more great games like this??Update.... Guess the game is about to hit 3 million!!! Guess they are getting those sales a little later.  This GAME IS AWESOME.  I've play it over and over again.  The online mode is also very good!  I can't tell you how much you feel like your playing a movie.  The voice acting, and animation is very realistic.  If you own a PS3 you need to own this in your library.
When this game is simply viewed as its own game and not compared to the first it is absolutely amazing game. I love the first crysis, but this game is still absolutely amazing, it's just different. I know they dropped the open world aspects of the first, and a few other things, but it's still a very good game. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and thought it a a good game. The story was good, I won't go into any sort of details on it, but I thought when compared to most other fps games the story in this game was actually pretty good. Obviously the graphics in this game are just incredibly stunning, and screenshots really don't do it justice. Going back and playing it a few years after it came out, it still is one of the best looking games on console. I would have only given it four stars because it wasn't open world like the first, and it doesn't have a few of the really cool things like the first did, but then I started to think about it and its still a fantastic game which definitely deserves five stars.
Ok, well, i just got the game today, and I've been playing for about an hour.  I have to say that the begining is very nice, kind of like a movie.  It hasn't been very challenging so far, and I choose the Expert level, having mastered the first game.  All I can say, is that they tried to give you something completely different as far game play.  I won't spoil the fun, by giving away what's different, but if you are a fan and have young kids (3,7), they will be captivated by watching you play or if they are old enough, they should have no problem playing themselves.If you are older and like challeging games, then, this may not be for you. This is very simular to the G-Force game. Cute and easy to play.I only played an hour, but I can't wait to contiune.  It is cute afterall.40 something with 2 young kids, and a gaming expert. I can't play violent games, so I have to play these games...  and overall they are fun.I give it 4 stars for it's potential to please and so far it has. I will update this as I play somemore.
don't get me wrong or anything, this game is great, but i think the camera moved a little too much. i was however displeased with the first-person view, i think this should be an option, 3rd or 1st person view. i played the game for about 45 minutes and i started to get dizzy and nausea set in.today i traded the game in because i wasn't going to play this knowing i would get sick. i took the game to gamestop and got a good trade-in value.sorry, i didn't get that far, i completed two missions and had to stop. but i gaurantee you'll love the gameplay. some people don't get sensitive to certain movements, but i do. i was so excited to get this game, i hated to trade it.i recommend this game to all serious video gamers.ps. (be forewarned) the guy at gamestop said he and alot of people get motion sick playing this game.i would say rent it first if you know you get motion sick.

I have waited a long time for this. So glad to see the favorites of yesteryear returning to Play Station in HD for the PS3.I bought these games for my children when they came out and we all fell in love with them. The kids are all grown now and on their own and we still love them just as much.Awesome job on the remake. I couldn't imagine just how different they would be in HD but when they are impressive on my old TV which isn't HD, that is going some. The quality of the picture is incredible.These games sure bring back a lot of memories. I hope you bring back more of them and please, they don't need to be like the games out today. That is part of what makes them so wonderful and entertaining. Keep the story line, the humor, and the all around good clean fun. Just never take away the charm of R&C;.
This is the best Action/Adventure game I have ever played.  The game play is fantastic and the graphics are phenomenal!  There have been a TON of reviews on here and those have probably covered just about every aspect of the game so I'll keep my review short and sweet.I would just like to point out one thing that doesn't get quite as much focus on this title -- the online play.  I'm not *usually* one to play online, but with this game the online is very addictive, immersive, and quite fun.  Even though I may get p0wned some of the time, I'm able to do a little p0wning of my own, and it is fun to do!This is the best game I have played on any system to date.  Recommended if you are a fan of the genre.*** UPDATE ***This game recently received Game of the Year for 2009!!!  If you haven't already, you have to get this game!
I bought this not really knowing what to respect. I knew about GoW release for the PS2 and the collection for PS3, but never bought as I always had other games that I wanted to play more...but if I would have only known I would have played this game years ago.ProsLControlsStory - Good enough to move the action along.Graphics - Cut scenes don't look very good, but the in game graphics are great...especially for a remake.Level design is great and the game is always challenging.Cons:Cut scenes look bad.Rear touch works find, but took a little while to get use to.Initial load time.It is kind of hard for me to write a review on this. Are graphics the best....no. Is the story great....no...Is the controls perfect...no. All of those things are good, so why did I gave it 5 stars...It is just plain fun and I can't put it down. Not many games pull me in to the point I play so much my thumbs hurt, but this is one of those games.
I realize that I am 3 years late on playing this game. I've had my PS3 since it came out and for some reason never gave this game a chance. I wanted to get this game before I spent $60 on the new one to make sure that it was my kind of game. Honeslty I would say that this is one of the funnest games out there. I look forward to playing this game all the way through before buying the new one. The creativity in this game is off the charts, it's in a way like Super Mario the PS3 version. It is more intuative than Super Mario and really isn't as simple as it looks but that is the best comparison I have for it. Kids can enjoy this game as much as serious gamers. I'm glad I'm a PS3 owner because I would buy one just for this game after experiencing its gameplay. This game is just simply fun. This is by far one of the best platform games out there. I can't wait to get to LBP 2 and hope that Sony makes this series a dynasty for years! If you enjoy this game I also suggest checking out Portal 2. They are in no way the same game or to similar honestly, except they are both platform/puzzle games and 2 of the best games you could own.
I read really good reviews about this game so I decided to check it out. I have to say, I'm impressed! It doesn't look like it would be a "strategic" game, but it is! It makes you think, and I think that's what makes it addicting. I only just started playing this game, but so far, I really like it!The good thing is that both kids and adults can enjoy this game. I'm 23, and I really like it. I work with kids who I know would like it too.EDIT: It's been months since I bought the game, and it's definitely one of my favorite games to play on the Wii. I taught my 2 sisters, and one of their boyfriends how to play, and they've all liked it!It's fun to play by yourself, and it's fun to play with other people (my sister's boyfriend got really competitive!)I seriously love this game!!

...  This game is a prime example of what can be done if a company decides to put maximum effort into there product.  This game is such a beutiful reminder of why we love the Twisted Metal series so much.  This easliy destorys the competion Carmawhat, Rouge who, Vigilante what #?The theme to this is Rolling Stones song Black, and it fits the idea for the game masterfully.  The contest now has some really freaky cahracters, doesn't matter if it's BRimstone the possessed priest, or Spectre the insane bride, you have some really sick characters.  Unlike the past two where we had Grannies and Hippies for contestants.There is so much destruction in this game that it is insane, and fun.  Virtually every thing can be destroyed.Overall this is well worth owning, no matter who you are (Unless your a tree hugging hippie who objects violence).

Music games have come so far since the original Guitar Hero hit the PS2. Four years ago, we tolerated questionable covers of some of our favorite songs, and even as more music labels started lending their talent to the plastic instrument titans, a handful of classic bands remained unattainable. We had the Stones and Dylan, but there was no way we'd ever see Zeppelin, Pink Floyd or the Beatles, right? Well, still no luck on those first two, but after some cajoling and (likely) a proverbial dump truck full of money, Harmonix somehow booked the Fab Four for their first video game tour in The Beatles Rock Band.Of course, The Beatles Rock Band is not the first band-centric music game in recent years. Metallica, Aerosmith and Van Halen have all received star treatment from competitor Guitar Hero, while Harmonix did release a pricy AC/DC disc last year as a Wal-Mart exclusive. But for The Beatles --arguably the most popular band in modern history - the developer suggested that a major overhaul was in order. And while the results may no necessarily live up to that initial announcement, baby-boomer Beatles devotees and hardcore plastic rockers should both be thrilled with the game.If you've seen screenshots or that surreal Abbey Road commercial, you know by now that the core game doesn't deviate much from the scrolling tracks layout established previously in the genre. And though The Beatles Rock Band does encourage the (much ballyhooed) harmonies, my family, friends and I were often too tone-deaf to really put this feature to use. But while the controls remain tried-and-true, it's the presentation that truly makes this collaboration a success.While the first two Rock Band games were always stylistically more dynamic than Guitar Hero thanks to numerous visual filters, this Beatles edition's attention to detail and psychedelic backgrounds raise the bar even higher. Shea Stadium and the Ed Sullivan set have been recreated beautifully, while the Abbey Road sojourns offer trippy music videos for the studio songs never performed live. Many of the latter transport the band outside of the studio completely. (You'll ride aboard the titular vehicle for "Yellow Submarine," for instance.)This visual fidelity means that the customization options had to be sacrificed. This is a worthy tradeoff, as it allows Harmonix to show how the band's costumes and style evolved along with their music. Seeing them get from their early 60s mop-top/suit getup to the bearded rooftop veterans just prior to their split is truly remarkable. And assuming that you're playing the 45 songs in the order recommended for the story mode, you'll see plenty of supplementary photos and archival video snippets to back up the artistic direction.As for the actual track list, many reviewers have already expressed frustration at the small song list. I, too, wish that "Strawberry Fields," "Norwegian Wood" and several others hadn't been omitted, but at least 44 of the songs are truly wonderful, with the early cover of "Boys" as the only oddity. Tracks like "Within You Without You" and the downloadable "All You Need is Love" show that sitars and string orchestras can be adapted to the plastic instruments as well, so songs like "Eleanor Rigby" are possible in the future.For many of you, the opposite may be true - you're so sick of band games that even The Beatles aren't enough to lure you back. If you fall into this camp, I'd urge you to still give this Rock Band a shot. The music is so joyous, the presentation so impeccable, that you may find yourself hooked all over again.--Reviewed by Justin Hemenway
Will supplement to what other reviewer's have said. Bought this for my wife. I have Rock band. Never owned a SingStar title before. If you like Karaoke this is the game for you. Much more difficult than the Rock Band vocals part, especially rapping which is tough. Resolution of videos varies from artist to artist, depending on resolution on which it was recorded originally (thus older videos or indie bands will have lesser resolution videos). Game with bundle brings 30 songs from different genres. Each additional song on the online store is $1.49. For those of you that are multilingual you can have access to some songs (limited still) in your language by switching languange. Right now the store has about 250 something songs (excluding the multilingual thing I said) with some known bands and some I have never heard off. Adding the PS Eye adds another dimension to the game. You can record audio only and video tracks and export them to a media stick. The online features are also very interesting. Quality of music is very good. Some people have complained of the volume of the vocal tracks, which I don't find so distracting. I seem to get more distracted by the videos (especially the Blink 182 video, which in some parts i just burst out laughing.) I liked the vocals for Rock Band more but I have only played Sing Star this twice. I think its a great party game provided your guests know some of the songs. I have heard that they will bring some new songs every so often on the store. Rock Band owners: Very little overlap in the songs in Rock Band and Sing Star!

They're bacccccccccck, and badder than ever!Twisted Metal Black is without a doubt the most disturbing game in the popular series.  Each character has a dark story, and is looking for an answer, but they need to win the tournament called Twisted Metal to receive thier wishes.  Characters from previous games in in here: Sweet Tooth, Mr. Grimm, Axel, Warthog, Minion, Road Kill and a batch of new characters.  I personally like the opening to Sweet Tooth.

At TGS (Tokyo Game Show) 2005, Sony of Japan announced that they were developing an original game for PSP: LocoRoco. Instead of the usual ports or re-creations or compliations of retro games, LocoRoco is a completely new venture. It focuses on a fictional planet where happy LocoRocos (yellow blobs) and MuiMuis (blue figures) live. One day, it is invaded by the Moja Troop, who eat LocoRoco. Your job is to tilt the surface to lead LocoRocos through their planet without getting eaten. You collect flowers, which gives you another LocoRoco. You can combine and separate LocoRocos, as well. You collect bugs as a food source for LocoRocos. Additionally, when you collect MuiMuis, you can get house parts.The game is very easy. As a PSP player of Tekken:DR, complicated combo moves and annoying nuisances with the analog stick make PSP games hard to play--especially ports that we're used to seeing on PSOne and PS2. With LocoRoco, you use 3 buttons during gameplay. The shoulder buttons (LEFT and RIGHT) are used to tilt, tapping the circle button separates LocoRocos, holding the circle button combines them, and holding down both shoulder buttons makes your LocoRocos jump. A lot easier said than done. A demo disc found at EBGames and a demo for download on the PSP Memory Stick show these capabilities and can be found for download at [...] You must have v2.71 for this to work, I might add.Besides a "career" mode, which pivots you into different courses with different color LocoRocos, there are "mini-games" like a Mui-Mui Crane, Chuppa game, and more. You must collect a certain amount of bugs/pickories every game to play these games. Also, there is the LocoRoco House Editor feature that allows you to create a house for your LocoRoco. I haven't yet tested it out but it is an excellent feature, I presume. By collecting MuiMuis in games, you get house parts and you can build a house for your LocoRoco.Besides all of the gameplay features, a large soundtrack is full of bubbly, interesting, and catchy jingles with unique voices. While some find it annoying, it is very catchy and it gets stuck in my head. LocoRocos even sing along in gibberish while the song goes on. MuiMuis do, as well. The graphics are 2D like Mario, which make loading times non-existant and shows off the capability of the PSP's high-performance graphics.In the end, LocoRoco is a game that is intuitive, simple, and beautiful to look at. It is fitted only for the PSP, and it should. Additionally, the gameplay is excellent, pivoting you into many different scenarios with many different characters (like Moja, who attack you or Chuppa, who catapults you into hidden areas). It is clearly worth $40--clearly.PROS-Intuitiveness and Simplicity: Easy to play, fitted for the PSPShows off PSP Graphic Capabilities: Beautiful to look atDifferent Maps, Characters, Colors: Very unique and freshNot a Port or Re-creation/compliation: A completely original gameNo Long Loading Times: 2D graphics prevents thisMini-Games: Lets you take a break from main gameplayCONS-Longevity: Only 40 levels makes you wish for more...Should've Used Characters More: Some characters pop up once...You have to pay money made in career to access mini-games5/5: FUN5/5: GRAPHICS5/5: GAMEPLAY4/5: PLAYABILITY19/20: TOTAL

A really interesting and fun platformer that anyone can enjoy (at least until BuiBui Fort 3).Oh, and did I mention it's fun?
In locoroco, the object of the game is to guide a little singing blob through a colorful level by tilting th planet, eating fruits to make you bigger on the way, and bumping into black evil blobs to make them stop eating you.Simple, yet, addicting, locoroco is the kinda game that makes you go, "five more minutes."Dont be fooled by the art and singing! This is in no way, a childish game(maybe just a bit) this game requires percise timeing and nimble fingers.BEWARE: listining to locoroco music may make you unintentionally singing it yourself. yes, its that addictiveA great game for anybody, locoroco is a must buy for a psp owner.
Simple yet extremely fun to play, LocoRoco is an excellent contender for the most innovative game of any platform this year (Okami is the only other contender in this area).  With a unique graphics style and easy to use but difficult to master gameplay, LocoRoco at first seems easy.  You just use the shoulder buttons to shift the world and help the LocoRocos escape the evil invaders.  Then you try to find all the LocoRocos per level, all of the MuiMuis and other bonus items and this game suddenly becomes a lot harder.  The brilliant thing is you can still advance even if you do not find all of these items.  With fantastic music and gameplay, this game is rapidly becoming my favorite for the PSP.

The GameNFL Street is seven-on-seven football where every player you pick for your team plays both offense and defense. On top of that, you can put any player at any position, enabling you to experiment with Warren Sapp at quarterback, Peyton Manning at nose tackle, Brian Urlacher at running back, and Peter Warrick at the corner.It's one of those games where football fans will be addicted after one score and the football haters will crossover when they see it because of the exciting gameplay that appeals to both sports and non-sports gamers alike ala classics like NBA Jam, NFL Blitz, and EA Big's other gem, NBA Street.As you play a game, it's not just about scoring points, it's about scoring points with style. The controls are simple as on offense you can lateral, hurdle, juke, or stiff arm, utilize your turbo to speed past defenses, and hit the showboat button to perform some of the most incredible taunts, high steps, and street moves imaginable, from dribbling the football along the ground like LeBron, to throwing passes behind your back, and even cannon-balling into the endzone. The more style you show, the more Gamebreaker points you accumulate.

As I said in the title, this is not a review. I just want to save like-minded people some time, and summarize what makes 2005 different from the 2004 title. While this isn't platform specific, the biggest upgrade this year is for the Xbox, as EA and Microsoft have finally settled, and online play has finally arrived via XBLive. I'd like to not assign stars at all, but Amazon doesn't allow for pre-release non-reviews. So I'm assigning 5 stars based on Madden 2004, and the promise of the following new features. It is not meant to be commentary about the 2005 title.I've done this for NCAA 2005 as well, but decided to adapt it for Madden as well. Everything in here is Madden-specific.GENERAL GAMEPLAY IMPROVEMENTS:- The hit stick: The Hit Stick is a brand-new control innovation whereby players can attempt to lay a big hit on their opponent by flicking the right stick. They are risky, as a mis-timed hit can be devastating to your defense, but it can all pay off with a huge hit and a fumble or dropped pass.- Reworked DB play/pass defense: Rebuilt from the ground up, with a focus on man-to-man coverage. Good DBs will now blanket their receivers better than ever before, and "shut down" corners will now play as such.- All alternate team jerseys are now available.- Updated player models for more intense realism.- Reworked stadiums, fans, and environmental graphics.- New running animations. "Over 1000 new animations added."FRANCHISE MODE IMPROVEMENTS:- Restricted Free Agents - Allow your young guys to test Restricted Free Agency.- Preseason Position Battles - Let two players who are similar in talent battle it out for the starting job.- Player Personalities - Players react to everything that happens to them and if things get really bad for them, they demand a trade. If you're not throwing the ball to your star receiver, you'll hear about it.- Franchise Tags - Tag players who refuse to re-sign with your team.- New Realistic Off-season Free Agency - Players no longer only care about money. They now look at your team, the players you have, your team prestige and lots of other factors.- Weekly Game-plan - Your coordinators provide you with a game-plan each week that contains keys to stop your upcoming opponents.- NFL Icons - They've acknowledged the stars in the NFL and they become Icons in your Franchise. These players influence free agents and affect morale if something happens to them.- Practice in Franchise - You can now practice with your current franchise team.- Improved Team Management - Teams intelligently manage their rosters now. They cut dead weight and sign regular season free agents.- Name Team Captains - You can now name your team captains every year in Franchise.- Rivalries - Rivalries are a new addition to Franchise this year.- Team Prestige - A new aspect of Franchise is prestige. Turn a perennial loser around to become a true powerhouse.- In-Season Player Progression - Players now progress based on how well they're doing during the season. Breakout players are rewarded for their performance.- Improved Draft - A ticker, announcer and trading during the draft highlight our draft improvements.- Change Player Positions - You can change the positions of players in Franchise every season now.- Storyline Central is a new addition to Franchise Mode this year that focuses on every story that is at the forefront in the NFL. The stories around your team now impact your team. If the rookie RB is pushing the veteran for playing time but not getting it, his morale will drop and it will affect his performance. You hear about the stories three different ways.1) Newspaper. Every team in Franchise has a newspaper from their local city that discusses only the stories that pertain to that team. We also feature USA Today, which is the franchise's national newspaper. In USA Today, the most important stories from the entire NFL appear.2) EA Sports Radio. They've added sports talk radio to Franchise, where host Tony Bruno breaks down the week's biggest stories. Each week's show includes call-ins, coach and player interviews, trivia questions and from time to time, Tony will rant about important issues in the NFL.3) Email. Every week on your PDA, you'll receive emails about everything going on with your team. You will receive emails from players, coaches, general managers, the PR department, etc.- Create-a-fan: Create your own dedicated crazy fans.

As I said in the title, this is not a review. I just want to save like-minded people some time, and summarize what makes 2005 different from the 2004 title. While this isn't platform specific, the biggest upgrade this year is for the Xbox, as EA and Microsoft have finally settled, and online play has finally arrived via XBLive. I'd like to not assign stars at all, but Amazon doesn't allow for pre-release non-reviews. So I'm assigning 5 stars based on Madden 2004, and the promise of the following new features. It is not meant to be commentary about the 2005 title.I've done this for NCAA 2005 as well, but decided to adapt it for Madden as well. Everything in here is Madden-specific.GENERAL GAMEPLAY IMPROVEMENTS:- The hit stick: The Hit Stick is a brand-new control innovation whereby players can attempt to lay a big hit on their opponent by flicking the right stick. They are risky, as a mis-timed hit can be devastating to your defense, but it can all pay off with a huge hit and a fumble or dropped pass.- Reworked DB play/pass defense: Rebuilt from the ground up, with a focus on man-to-man coverage. Good DBs will now blanket their receivers better than ever before, and "shut down" corners will now play as such.- All alternate team jerseys are now available.- Updated player models for more intense realism.- Reworked stadiums, fans, and environmental graphics.- New running animations.

If you're not throwing the ball to your star receiver, you'll hear about it.- Franchise Tags - Tag players who refuse to re-sign with your team.- New Realistic Off-season Free Agency - Players no longer only care about money. They now look at your team, the players you have, your team prestige and lots of other factors.- Weekly Game-plan - Your coordinators provide you with a game-plan each week that contains keys to stop your upcoming opponents.- NFL Icons - They've acknowledged the stars in the NFL and they become Icons in your Franchise.

You hear about the stories three different ways.1) Newspaper. Every team in Franchise has a newspaper from their local city that discusses only the stories that pertain to that team. We also feature USA Today, which is the franchise's national newspaper. In USA Today, the most important stories from the entire NFL appear.2) EA Sports Radio. They've added sports talk radio to Franchise, where host Tony Bruno breaks down the week's biggest stories.

If you want a innovative baseball expierence, then you must get MVP Baseball 2004. Ever since EA Sports changed Triple Play to MVP Baseball in 2003, it has been one of the top sellers in the baseball category.First off, MVP Baseball's hitting feature is 5 stars. It's like the right thumbstick is a bat. If you point the stick up, you will hit either a pop fly or if you have someone like Vladimir Guerrero, you will hit a homerun. If you point the stick down, you will hit a grounder.Pitching is also genius. You have the pitching meter, so if you choose to have a power up pitch, your pointer on the meter will go into the red zone. The harder the pitch, the harder it is to get into the green zone, which is accuracy. So if you need to be accurate, you may want to take some off your pitch.Graphics are the best in any MLB game. `Nuff said.But in a great game there is always bad stuff. I was pitching mike stanton for the Mets with 24 stamina and it was very simple to put your pitches anywhere. Once you get the hang of the pitching meter, it is very easy to throw difficult pitches. Also, if a fast runner, or even medium speed runner, hits a gapper, he will get an easy triple and even maybe an inside the park homerun. It always seems your chasing those long fly balls.But aside from that, the amount of extras are impeccable. There are retro jerseysfrom every team and 50 old school players. They have players like Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Jackie Robinson. Clearly, MVP Baseball is the best MLB game of our time, period!

As I said in the title, this is not a review. I just want to save like-minded people some time, and summarize what makes 2005 different from the 2004 title.  While this isn't platform specific, the biggest upgrade this year is for the Xbox, as EA and Microsoft have finally settled, and online play has finally arrived via XBLive.  I'd like to not assign stars at all, but Amazon doesn't allow for pre-release non-reviews.  So I'm assigning 5 stars based on NCAA 2004, and the promise of the following new features.That aside (despite it being a huge issue), the following changes come directly from EA Sports announcements.  What follows is verifiable on their website or with a few well-placed Google searches.  I present it for convenience.  These 'pre-release reviews' that always pop up for titles might as well serve a real purpose, besides of course the all-important "tHIs gAme iS dEFiNaTEly (sic) gOInG tO RAwK!!!" proclamations.  But I digress, the summary follows, I intend to keep my personal commentary to an absolute minimum;GENERAL GAMEPLAY IMPROVEMENTS:- Big hits:  The option to take a chance on really plastering another player.  Increases the chance of a fumble or dropped pass, but also the chance of you whiffing on the tackle.- Improved run blocking and new run animations:  No more getting stuck against or behind your own linemen.  Good offensive lines now open better holes and routes.- Home Field Advantage:  The bigger the stadium, the louder the crowd, the greater the impact.  Pumping up the crowd carries more meaning and response.  Visiting teams have to fight an uphill battle against the environment, based upon the strength of the home team's stadium and crowd.- Interactive Timeouts: You're now given a choice on which group to coach, it can directly address ratings and composure levels depending on those of your team captains.  You can now "ice the kicker" with timeouts, as composure is an issue for all players.- Match-Up Stick:  Player ratings (in game) can now change based upon the individual's ability to handle pressure.  You can now check composure and mismatches pre-snap.- Custom fans:  Set up your own 'crazed' fans with a variety of options, accessories, appearances, etc.  To add to the college gameday atmosphere, and...- Custom celebrations:  Choose to play a mascot, fan or player animation, decide between mild and extreme.- More "user" stats:  User pick tracking was well received, now more stats are tracked in this form in your record book.DYNASTY MODE IMPROVEMENTS:- Roster expansion to 70 (according to the producer, although 75 has been reported elsewhere).  It's been down at 55 for years, which has been a source of frustration for those who enjoy dynasty mode.- Top 25 Stadiums tracking:  In dynasty mode, you can build home field advantage where there was little or none before, the top 25 places to play are tracked.- Team Captains:  As part of a deeply enhanced dynasty mode, you can now name captains.- Program integrity:  Dynasty depth - keep tabs on your players, you can now suffer academic issues and/or team rule violations.  You choose how to discipline, and you can now actually lose scholarships, television exposure, and post-season play if you don't run a clean program.  It also speaks to;- Player transfers:  You can now lose athletes to transfers if they're unhappy, and feel like they should be seeing the field more.  You can also have players from other programs request a transfer in if you're not deep at their position.- Recruiting pipelines:  You can now build your presence outside of your immediate geographic region.- Improved scouting:  You can now unlock prospect attributes without offering a scholarship first.- Better defined offensive/defensive coaching strategies:  Speaks to play-calling, simulation and recruiting.- Accurate conference schedule rotation.- Athletes:  You can now recruit a kid just for his athletic ability, and define or switch his position on the roster later.  If you have a QB who would make a better FS or WR, you can switch him, and he will progress according to his new position, not the old.- More/improved Sports Illustrated stories, magazine covers and insight throughout the season.- More trophies.  Added support for the Rimington and Doak Walker.  28 bowl trophies, 49 rivalry trophies.- All-Conference teams.  To supplement 1st and 2nd team All-American tracking.ONLINE PLAY IMPROVEMENTS:- Opponent scouting:  They've added a new scouting report that allows you to check any player's (online) tendencies. You can look at their favorite playbook and formation, as well as look at how much they no-huddle, call hot routes, and audible.  It's meant to try and cut down on the number of games wasted to opposition that cheats or otherwise plays in a manner you're not interested in.- Quick tournaments:  4 or 8 player tournaments built right into the online system.- Even team mode:  An option that will allow an even playing field, regardless of the `real world' strengths and weaknesses of two programs/teams.- Improved leaderboards.- Minigames.That's all I've come across so far, but it's a factual aggregation of information, all directly from the source.  Either Electronic Arts, and/or Rod Moye the producer via an interview on EASports.  None of this comes through third parties, or speculation.  Given that, this looks to be one of the biggest leaps forward this franchise has enjoyed in some time.  Particularly for Xbox fans as they finally get online play, but really for everyone.

This game is epic and it spawned the best series of shooter game. The only thing i hate about this game is you HAVE to play as the bad guys, If you actually read the story about killzone you learn why the hellghast are all angry and want their planet back. The isa forced them off of vekta and made them move to the hellish iradiated planet hellghan but the people adapted and became hellghast. And they try to take back their planet vekta from the isa around 150 years later, i would have liked to play as hellghast rather than the greedy cocky isa.

After having embarked on a massive Exodus to the planet Helghan,the castaways of your home planet Vecta regroup and re-arm with vengeance in mind.It's up to you and some "tough as nails" squadmates to fend off the massive Helghast onslaught of your home planet with the help of some unique and powerful weaponry.

Ignore the nay-sayers and critics and experience one of the greatest battles the playstation community has ever seen. So hurry up and dive in, cause there's a world that needs saving.

All this game is fighting huge cratures known as colosuss and getting to them,which may not sound like much but after you fight the 1st colosuss you'll be begging for more fights aginst bigger colosuss!  I beat the 1st one at night and couldn't wait to encounter more the next dayI'm not an expert on graphics,but the colosuss look really good to me....and the whole world is quite a sight...The music seals the deal,once you start a battle some really great battle music that goes really well with whatever colosuss you're fighting (there are a number of different tunes) AND when you start to climb the colosuss and reach his weak point,the music changes,and it makes all the battles a lot more enjoyable.The story,it really doesn't seem to have one,its just 'defeat all 16 colosuss to bring your lady friend back to life"But all is explained in the end,but I won't spoil any part of this great storyThere's much to do after you beat the game,time attack mode is unlocked and if you beat it a certain amount of times you can explore new areas that where previously unreachable. I'm almost done with my 3rd time beating it...Highly recommended!  At $40,it's a steal!
