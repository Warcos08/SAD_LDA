There are two things to think about when talking about this game. One is the game mechanics themselves and one is the execution of the look and feel of the game. On the former the game lacks, but as far as the way the game looks and sounds you will be hard pressed to find a computer game that puts you this deeply into a franchise. Blade Runner is this kind of game.Westwood Studios decided to take a stab at the Blade Runner franchise and make a game so true to the movie that you would be hard pressed to tell the difference. I think they succeeded in this. They do it in three ways: Plot or story structure, visuals and sound. All of which holds onto an important credo: be true to the source material.The plot itself puts you in the Blade Runner world as a Rep Detec (a Blade Runner) on the hunt for a group fugitive replicants. Apparently this is all happening at the exact same time as the movie events as well (kinda like two different cases going on in the department). The mood and manner of the story is well done and they brought in a wealth of talent to do with voice acting, including a few from the original movie (Sean Young, Brion James, William Sanderson and more). Add some really nice cut scenes and you get a pretty theatrical experience. One "scene" where you walk out of your apartment balcony so see the city streets and skyline is almost worth playing the game alone.The visuals are stunning for when the game was made. Actually they still are. The backgrounds are pre-rendered with some interaction here and there. While that sounds like it makes a rather static game it does mean when you walk into a familar Blade Runner movie location you REALLY feel it. Down to the little details the background visuals really inspire.While the visuals are great I think what really makes the difference in this game is the sound. I think this game takes full advantage of having 32 channels of audio, and if it doesn't it sure does sound like it. Every location you go to is filled with environmental sounds. This more than anything else sucks you into the setting. Add to that the occasional cues from the Vangelis soundtrack (which mixes in perfectly by the way), PLUS the incredible voice acting, and the audio experience in breathtaking. Even with two speakers it's incredible. Add some surround sound and you will get lost in the game.Okay that's all the good stuff about the game, but I did say the actual game play was merely average. I meant that. The game is incredibly static. While you can travel all over the place and see the beautiful sites and sounds (which is a good thing if you think about it) the game will not progress until you take a specific action or interview a specific person. You play a detective in the game, but since the game is so linear you really don't get a chance to stretch your detecting skills much.Also while the backgrounds and static images or animations are incredible Westwood made a compromise and decided to reduce the resolution of the items that are more dynamic so more people with "average" systems at the time could enjoy the game. The end result is you are a very pixelated character and the characters you interact with are just as pixellated. While shading is not too bad on your pixelled self any time you compare with the backgrounds the difference is painfully obvious.So the game had pixelled characters and VERY linear gameplay. That's not the reason to get it. The reason to buy Blade Runner is to get yourself immersed in the Blade Runner universe. This, more than anything else, is what the accomplishes in spades.

There are many "buried treasures" in the Playstation One library, which is vast beyond belief, but Spryro 2: Ripto's Rage is one of the very best.  There are few games of this calibur and playability even on the vaunted PS2.  And in many ways, this game is more than classy enough both in conception, and graphical beauty to BE a PS2 title anyway.  Hint, to PS2 owners, add this to your library because as you know, you can play older PSOne games on your system and this is downright a steal at the price compared to some very expensive PS2 games that aren't near as good.This isn't a flight sim, a space shooter, a FPS where you look behind some gun trying to kill, it's not a strategy game (though some strategy plays a part), nor is it some Lord of The Rings type of mythical BS.  It's all about this purple flying, jumping, swimming (and more) cartoon dragon character.  Exploring and learning and collecting within a magical, dreamy, peaceloving, almost Wizard of Oz type land full of beautiful scenery and places, lots of strange characters and creature and things, and lots of pretty psychedelic colors, lights, and special effects.This game reminds me of a 3d Super Mario game, and while easy going (trancy, space-type music plays in some parts adding to the strange otherworldly experience), and a pretty simple platform game, that's its main beauty and playability.  This is truly like playing in a cartoon and not by any means a static cartoon, as the graphics are almost studio-movie quality in animation.  This game genre has been done in countless ways, but this really does rank up there with those long hour killing days of manipulating Mario around, but in a magical, fairy tale land all presented in intense colors and shapes and forms.  While the gameplay in Spyro is so simplistic on early levels that a 6 year old would have no problem with it, in a way, this is a game for all ages, and most 60 plus year olds would probably get a kick out of it too.  I'd also highly recommend it as a game parents can play along with their kids as its so much fun for both, with enough interest and playability and eye candy for both as well.For others between those ages, I can't recommend this game enough as just a pleasant, non-violent trip into a land over the rainbow now and then, and is even a good stress reliever in some ways.  A lot of PSOne games leave a lot to be desired, in these days of the second-generation consoles and higher end PC games, that usually means graphics.  Then again, a lot of the newer (and a lot more expensive) games of this type on those more costly systems, are great looking but lack gameplay.This is not only on a par graphics wise with most PS2 games, but in gameplay as well.  PsOne or PS2 owners alike will not be disappointed in spending the low price of this game to add to their collection.  I had tried lots of PSOne games (still don't have a PS2 but have seen enough to know what they're capable of graphically) before buying this particular game, and it was worth every cent, because for all practical (and graphical) purposes, this looks and plays a lot more like a PS2 game than a PSOne.  My first reaction upon playing this was just, "WOW."This is as good as anything on PS2, Xbox, or Gamecube, both graphically and in playability, period.  Easy, fun, relaxing trips with a goofy little purple dragon and tinkerbell, in a land of beauty and color and strangeness.  What more could one ask from a game?  Buy this now while you still can, whether you have a PSOne OR a PS2.  This is a real gem of a video game, for the kids, and for those so-called "adults" out here who are simply and forever will remain, kids at heart.

Okay, caveat emptor right here at the beginning, my eyes and vision, as well as other related physical and psychological limits are going downhill fast, in this, mad world, and I don't have nearly the time or ability I'd like to playing video games more often.  While I still think video game technologies and advancements have come a long way indeed, in barely a decade, a lot of the newer, FPS (first person shooter) games for the up-to-the-minute game consoles and PC, so popular these days (unhappily), leave me cold.  Rare is it these days, that a video game shows any imagination besides the same old tired shoot everything that moves genre.  With lots of gratuitous blood and guts and lots of very unpleasant events (GTA, et al), and silly music games offered with silly fake instruments and even more ridiculous results (folks, buy a cheap, REAL guitar, sheesh, learn a few chords, and let your imagination take you wherever), I wonder, even with PSP and Nintendo DS confusion, whatever happened to having FUN playing video games?I remember in the early days of the PSP, which I had considered buying at one time due to my vision problems, where early on, there were cracks and hacks out there, and even pushed by hosts of G4TV, back before G4TV turned to crap and got rid of most of their best shows, which allowed me to actually play Mario and countless other SNES and Sega Genesis, and other games.  I don't know if it's even possible to buy PSP's hackable version  to play old SNES and/or Sega Genesis classics, "THEY" probably put an end to that a long time ago.I, the humble, lower economic class owner of my beloved PS2, thus offer the following.While XBOX360/PS3/Wii fans may either live in nirvana of the new dayz or even long for a better (?) time, some of us older others remember and applaud when the GAME and PLAYABILITY was all important.  For us, so many of the "next-generation" efforts in the way of graphics, are amazing but it's "in the game" beyond graphics, and so is the case with earlier efforts such as this, Good old Sly Cooper, in his original adventure.Dazzling graphics are one thing, and this game equals anything found on the newer (post-PS2), if I many say so.  The colors and graphics here are second to none.  And while deep down, I still believe the first three original Super Mario games, and Mario World, all for the SNES, still define the height console video games ever reached, this particular game, perhaps like Mario 64 and other such, questions that theory/belief.  Not that other platform games, 2D or 3D haven't tried.  Witness Spyro, Rayman, and Crash Bandicoot, etc., for examples.  Take these general opinions and my personal philosophy of video games, for what its' worth.  But for any platform game lover, this is a must buy if you have a PS2 or PS3 capable of playing older PS games.While I cannot talk of the Gamecube or Wii endeavors with Mario, since I've never owned those gaming systems, I do own and have for some time, a good ol' new version of the PS2 (which may never die, Thank God), and of all platform games I've played for the PS1 and PS2,  this has to be closer to one of the best platform games of all time, and will I'm sure, not let down any casual gamer of any age.  Experienced gamers might find it a bit easy, but that is to be expected among most gamers.Sly Cooper is a sly fox, yes he is.  If one gets lost early on, as I did, I suggest you delete your saved profile(s), and start anew.  Because there can be frustrations early on if you don't watch and listen to your help characters, from beginning onwards through each completed stage.  Regardless of similar such games as this, this is fun and easy for all ages, and remains the best SLY COOPER game ever, and probably always will.  For any PS2 game player not familiar with Sly and his merry bunch of accomplices and beautifully drawn and colored graphics, and especially for any true fan of platform 3D games, this game remains one of the finest and most excellent overall platform games ever.If you can still play PS2 games on whatever system(s) you  own, and want a good, old-fashioned platform game, which is actually relaxing (no real timers hurrying you along) and easy but still challenging and quite cute at times without being unnecessarily frustrating, with superb graphics and replayability, you can't go wrong here.  This is definitely one of the PS2's finest efforts, and still holds up to this day, for both young and old gamers alike.  Dinosaur gamers like me with failing eyesight or cerebral ability to keep up with dozens of commands to make your onscreen character work, will love this, though advanced gamers, may find it the equivalent of one who mastered the Super Mario games trying to play Pong.Come to think of it though, Pong was, I still protest, a pretty cool game, and still is...as are the Super Mario games, and Tetris, and I'll just stop for now before I start discussing Ecco...

This is the best FPS exclusive to the PS2 that one can buy.  By far the best.  But is that saying very much?Alright, I know I gave it 4 stars; that's because it is a very intense, very addictive game.  Also, it has very many positive points, such as its high-speed action, well set atmosphere, and the panic inducing screaming that is always going on.Now this was no Halo killer, for this game had its flaws.  The graphics were not up to snuff with the latest PS2 releases, the audio fuzzes out, and the AI is...well...not smart.There were a couple of things missing too.  Having them would have made the game a bit extra special.The good points:  No PS2 exclusive FPS has the speed and fluidity of this game.  Finally, a run-and-gun that the system needed.  While pretty much all the other games were either pretty slow and calculating, or just plain bad, Killzone keeps the action alive constnatly.  It's linear setup keeps things moving right along as you jog from place to place, riddling your opponents with lots of  nice anmmunition.Also a good point is the atmosphere.  Few games have developed surroundings quite like this.  The destruction and the grime is so extensive that it simply makes you wonder...did little pixelated people really ever actualy inhabit this place?  The color scheme  is so bleak that it alone delivers a sense of hopelessness and the feeling that someone...something with glowing orange eyes is watching you.  Even the wind sounds, yes, the wind contributes to this.  The few things mentioned and many other little aspects all add to the environmental tension, and it is nice.Finally, although it gets annoying by the end of the game, everyone, I mean EVERYONE is screaming during gunfights.  The confusions that is heard over the gunfire is also key to the environment, as you the player know that the enemy is losing it just as much as you are.Alright...the bad newsThe graphics the graphics the graphics!!!!!!  Sometimes things just disappear and you can see through them, causing a bit of confusion, especially for the first time through the game.  If your TV has a very dark contrast, at some points it might be incredibly difficult to deal with whenever this problem happens.  The deaths that take place seem to happen in a total of 3 frames, and when characters die, they twist and contort in ways that...well...only jellyfish can.In addition, with all of the shouting, weaponfire, and machinery noise, sometimes the audio shuts off.  About 2/3 of my way into the game, my weapons stopped making noise.  This was a bit awkward.  Also, sometimes when your allies talk, the audio is so fuzzy that it becomes diffcult to understand them during or after a gunfight, especially one with lots of explosions.Also a flaw, the AI is not smart.  They will keep charging twoards you even if you're firing away at the heads; and it gets worse.  Alright so when I was playing in the final zone, as I descended a ladder, I landed directly behind an opponent.  Standing in front of him, facing me, was another one of his partners.  Neither came after me.  I was able to ascend the ladder again and pitch a grenade in their direction.  In any other game, I would have been long dead.Some stuff that was missing:There were no vehicles to commandeer.  Driving is never a bad thing.The weapons selection was somewhat limited.  Only about 10 weapons max were available.The multiplayer is less than mediocre.  The environments are horribly small and take you in circles...a lot.Overall, this game was very good.  But it had some flaws from keeping it from being great and deserving of a perfect 5 out of 5.  I found out that the initial perspective release date of this  game was Winter of 2005, but it came out just over a year earlier.  Even six more months of development could have fixed the flaws in this game.  Unfortunlately it was released to compete with Halo 2, and it didn't exactly compare.Good news though, the ending was very much left open for a sequel!!! :)

One of the most addictive games...I wrote a review on this game under the Xbox title a few days ago (5 stars), and now that I've conquered the Single Player mode and had time to sit back and enjoy other aspects of it, I'm itching to write another review with a little more insight... so I'll review the PS2 version of the title.  Hey, it's virtually the same game on both consoles, right?First and foremost, this game is one of the most addictive games I've ever played.  It's missing a few things, which I'll go over later, but the stellar gameplay and character involvement absolves it of its few issues.The single player campaign is one of the best I've seen.  Despite being completely linear (you can't make any choices at all, with the exception of choosing your girlfriend, but I don't believe even that has any real affect on the outcome of the game), it's a pretty interesting story and you find yourself taking a genuine interest in your clan's survival on the street.  There were one or two occassions when I desperately wished I had a choice to make because a plot twist ticked me off (it's not a cheap twist or anything, but you're forced to do something that, given the choice, you would likely not do), but it wasn't anything that affected my enjoyment of the game at all.  The story is simple, yet interesting.On top of a good story, there are a TON of customization options.  I won't go into the details of buying clothes, gear, jewelry, etc, but rest assured, it's all there and it's done very, VERY well.  In fact, the level of customization available for this game is beyond any other console game I've played.Anyway, this game REALLY shines in 3 major areas of importance:  gameplay, graphics, and sound:GAMEPLAY - 10/10I like fighting games, but I usually find myself getting bored with them after about 5 or 10 hours of play (Soul Calibur II is a good example - great game, but got boring).  I rented this game for a WEEK, and as soon as the rental period expired, I went out and bought my own copy of it.  There are several traits that shoot this game's replay value through the roof.  The first one (and most important one) is the fact that there are four very distinct fighting styles.  What's truly amazing is that the styles are so different, but the controls don't feel awkward if and when you decide to try a new one with a new character.  That's quite a feat to achieve.  These different styles all have their distinct advantages and disadvantages, and later on in your character's development, you can pick up two secondary styles in addition to your primary one in order to balance your character out.  The second trait is what you can do after beating the game.  Obviously, you can go through it all again with a whole new development strategy, or you can play any of the 80 characters in one-on-one, 2 vs. 2, free for alls, etc.  I've put around 20 hours into this game so far, and I'm still itching to play it.The fighting mechanics themselves are first-rate.  As I mentioned in my other review, controls will likely feel a bit sluggish for your first few matches.  But as soon as you start developing your "speed" attribute, that feeling will quickly fade.I did find the default difficulty to be a bit too challenging.  I knocked it down to "Easy" and it felt pretty good for me.  You might find "Medium" or even "Hard" more to your liking, but the point is that you can adequently adjust the CPU's skill level.GRAPHICS - 10/10Of all of the console games I have played or seen firsthand, Def Jam Fight For NY has the best graphics, hands down.  Each of the arenas are visually appealing, and the characters' detail is absolutely amazing.  There's not much to say in this department other than "the graphics kick !#$".SOUND - 9.5/10The sound is almost perfect in this game, and if you can play the game in 5.1 surround, you'll get some serious kick out of your speakers.  From the great voice acting to the bone-crunching sounds of limbs grinding and breaking, you can easily tell that sound was a serious priority for this title.  The ONLY reason I don't give the sound a 10 is because the music gets old (I'm not a hip-hop fan, so maybe this is just my problem) and you can't load your own custom tracks (only applicable to Xbox, I assume).  Seeing as how most EA titles use their branded "EA Game Trax" (or whatever it's called), it's a very strange omission for this title.CONSOkay, now for the bad news.  Coming up with something negative to say about this game is difficult.  It's production values are first class, so I almost feel guitly writing this.  But, hopefully, these things will be corrected/added in the next iteration of this series.  None of these should be deal-breakers for ANYONE considering this game, but they're things that would only make it better in the future:Online Play:  The game has good multiplayer features to it, but it's all limited to living room game parties.  What do you do when your friends go home and your wife won't let you wail on her for a few rounds (by the way, kicking the snot out of Carmen Electra has a very disturbing satisfaction to it)?  Being able to jump online with the character that you've created and nutured would be at the top of my list of requests for the next title.  Online play should feature online voice chat along with the basic game modes (1 on 1, 2 on 2, free for all, etc).Custom Tracks:  Frankly, there's no excuse for ANY Xbox game omitting this feature.  I know this doesn't apply to the PS2, but for Xbox owners, it's a legitimate irritation.REQUESTSOkay, now for a few things that would be nice to have next time around, but the game doesn't really suffer without them:More Styles:  I know I'm getting greedy, but pitting these different styles against eachother is a blast.  Other games have done it before, but it's always just been a superficial feature.  It usually didn't really make much of a difference.  In this game, each style has a specific purpose.  I can't say what other styles I would like to see, but I say the more the better!Non-Linear Storyline:  I mentioned that the linearity of the story doesn't really pull down the enjoyment of the title, but it can't be argued that being able to make even just a few basic decisions along the way wouldn't be a great touch.Ground Fighting:  This is a minor request, but a little more attention to the ground fighting would be great.That's pretty much it.  If you have the slightest interest in fighting games, you will enjoy this title.  Lastly, this game has an "M" rating.  Needless to say, it earned every bit of it and then some.  Keep it as far from children as possible.
One of the most addictive games...I wrote a review on this game under the Xbox title a few days ago (5 stars), and now that I've conquered the Single Player mode and had time to sit back and enjoy other aspects of it, I'm itching to write another review with a little more insight... so I'll review the PS2 version of the title.  Hey, it's virtually the same game on both consoles, right?First and foremost, this game is one of the most addictive games I've ever played.  It's missing a few things, which I'll go over later, but the stellar gameplay and character involvement absolves it of its few issues.The single player campaign is one of the best I've seen.  Despite being completely linear (you can't make any choices at all, with the exception of choosing your girlfriend, but I don't believe even that has any real affect on the outcome of the game), it's a pretty interesting story and you find yourself taking a genuine interest in your clan's survival on the street.  There were one or two occassions when I desperately wished I had a choice to make because a plot twist ticked me off (it's not a cheap twist or anything, but you're forced to do something that, given the choice, you would likely not do), but it wasn't anything that affected my enjoyment of the game at all.  The story is simple, yet interesting.On top of a good story, there are a TON of customization options.  I won't go into the details of buying clothes, gear, jewelry, etc, but rest assured, it's all there and it's done very, VERY well.  In fact, the level of customization available for this game is beyond any other console game I've played.Anyway, this game REALLY shines in 3 major areas of importance:  gameplay, graphics, and sound:GAMEPLAY - 10/10I like fighting games, but I usually find myself getting bored with them after about 5 or 10 hours of play (Soul Calibur II is a good example - great game, but got boring).

Of many of the strategy games I've played as a gamer this most definatly my favorite.  This game relies less on resource managment and more on strait out action and combat.  There are 3 different campaigns for each nationality (China which relies on nubmers, USA which relies on its more powerful vehicles and GLA which relies on its versitility although its the weakest of the 3 in my opinion.)  Although I have yet to beat teh campain most of the fun is in the skirmishs taking on computer paleyrs, while initially it may be hard, once you grow accustmed to the way teh enemy's play you can easily beat them.  This makes the game seem almost too easy, although I can't quite beat a hard enemy right now but this is  the first I've played in awhile and I'm once again regaining my strategy, but I'm faily certain at one point I could beat teh ardest enemy difficutly with ease.  What does all this mean? It means for a good challenge you'll eventually have to resort to online play leaving people on 56k to easily be left in teh dark (while I use broadband now I remember almost everything lagged in 56k.)Very highly recomned for trs fans seeking fast paced action.

this game is a suberb game. It is very opened ended and fun. You are guy and you are in a extremely interactatable city. You can become a paramedic, crimanil, fireman, cop, gangster the possibilities are endless. It allows you to enter any car on the map. It is extremely fun and addictive. Get for kids they'll adore it. I know a 11 year old he has this game and him and second grade brother love it. Parents high addictability though makes this game a privilage. About the content it's nothing they haven't seen or played before in movies or video games. There are some PG rated shows with more content. Infact if you are caught in a violent situation the best way to get out isn't to go on killing rampage. It is eather to let yourself get arrested or run. You'll never get tired of this it is very fun and interactable.Pros: Very funVery interactableCombines walking around driving and even flying and boatingGood for all agesVery unlinearEndless possibilitiesVery hard to get tired ofHas optiontional missionsDecent GraphicsCons: Controls could be better

When GTA3 dropped Oct.22, 2001 I remember it like when MTV aired Micheal Jackson's Thriller. It was a game my homies and I had been anticipating for a long time! And with the tragedy that had happened just the month before....We wondered if it'd drop. But, it did! And the day it dropped one of my closest homies (who was also a co-worker) called in sick that day. GTA 3 originally was exclusive to PS2. Which pissed me off, cause I had a Dreacast (& GTA2 among my games). This game was the reason why I bougt a PS2 shortly after this game dropped....Playing DVD's was fine. But GTA3 was thee S**t!!! The game was revolutonairy for it's open world enviornment. The games world actually mimmicked real world....It'd go from day to night. It'd get rainy or foggy. People (AI) walking down streets would just randomly mug other AI's or jack them for their car! You could pick up "street walkers", carry a variety of weapons. Ranging from bats,pistols,shot guns,sniper rifles,fully automatics,flame thrower,molotove,gernades, & RPG's! You could sniperPeople, rob people, do missions (including vigilante missions). Or my favorite....Just mess around in an open world. You could drive various cars, trucks, buses, ambulance, cop car, fire truck, a tank, & even a ride w/ hydrollics!!! Sure the game isn't as awesome now in comparissum to it's sequals & some other new games. But for it's time it was the new standard for gaming! And it's still a classic game like Super Mario Bros,Sonic 1,2,& 3, Altred Beast,Metroid,ect.... Still fun to play on occasion in my opinion. And can look a lot better played on modern LCD,Plasma,LED TV's w/ the HD cables for PS2!!! I recommend this game to anyone that had it years ago,anyone who plays the newer GTA's or Saint Rows, This is the grandfather of the current gen games of this genre...Respect the elders,lmao!

PLAY,CREATE,SHARELittleBig Planet solo para el Playstation 3, en un juego muy divertido, parece simple pero tambien es muy desafiante, del estilo de Super Mario, LittleBigPlanet nos invita a sumergirnos en un mundo de fantasia donde la creatividad es la orden del dia. Aunque sus graficos parezcan pocos sofisticado, la belleza de los mismos se apreciaen en HD (720p) texturas, efectos, disenos, mundos, y lo mejor de todo la personalizacion del personaje principal Sackboy/sackgirl que hace que cada uno sea distinto y unico.Perfecto para toda la familia, los pequenos de la casa se divertiran y los mas grandes tambien, no solo con los niveles disponibles en en el discom sino la gran cantidad de DLC que constantemente se lanza atraves de la PlayStation Network tanto de niveles, trajes y demas que se puedan imaginar.Multiplayer: FANTASTICO, es que este juego se disfruta mas en compania (sea local o online)El Online: IMPRESIONANTE. no solo te permite jugar en linea con hasta 4 participantes mas, sino que al poder los usuarios crear "mundos" y subirlos, encontraras niveles nuevos todos los dias, de todas las tematicas, solo la imaginacion es tu limite y como dice el comercial "you never finish LittleBigPlanet", y es cierto, siempre hay retos y aventuras nuecas esperando a un click de distancia y todo de manera sencialla de obtener.LittleBigPlanet, un videojuego que no puede faltar en ninguna coleccion de Playstation 3 que se precie, no importa si eres hard core gamer u casual camer, no importa si te gustan los shooters o las plataformas, el arcade o la simulacion, es un MUST HAVE.A que esperas para tenerlo?
Half Life 2 Episode 1, es la continuacion de Half Life 2 y mucho mas.  Me atreveria a decir que a pesar de lo corto de su duraci&oacute;n, hay mucha mas diversion de la que hay en todo HL2.Salvese quien pueda-------------------Al final de HL2 el Dr. Freeman logro detener la huida del Dr. Breen y destruyo el reactor en la cima de la citadela.  Y GMan lo puso en estasis de nuevo.  Ahora la mision es escapar de ciudad 17 junto con Alyx Vance antes que el reactor explote.  Es aqui donde los problemas empiezan.Me siento solo----------------Bueno, esta vez el Dr. Freeman no est&aacute; solo, se encuentra acompa&ntilde;ado de Alyx quien esta vez har&aacute; un poco mas que solo abrir puertas y hacer comentarios graciosos.  Ahora ambos estan juntos y deben luchar para habrirse paso atravez de una ciudad en caos.&iquest;Qu&eacute;... Ya?----------------------La accion se desarrolla sin dar respiro y afortunadamente los desafios son tan variados que cuando menos lo sientas el juego termin&oacute;. El juego es relativamente corto, unas 5 o 6 horas de juego. Sin embargo la canitidad ha sido sustituida por calidad, pues al final te sentiras satisfecho y con ganas de m&aacute;s.  A esperar el episodio 2.Calificacion:Graficas: 9Sonido: 9Control: 8Historia: 8-------------Diversion: 9
Terriffic Game!En este review no puedo decir algo nuevo de lo que ya se ha comentado sobre este juego. Historia Tremenda! (Como es costumbre en la serie) Graficos Increibles y accion frenetica desde el inicio del juego (comienza justo donde finalizo GOW II), Jefes Imponentes y con efectos sumamente logrados, de lo mejor en graficos que existe para el PS3, y la jugabilidad simple y adictiva que ha hecho de la serie GOW todo un exito en todas sus versiones. Dicho esto solo puedo recomendar el Juego, no puede faltar en cualquier coleccion que se precie de PS3.PROS:-Excelente historia (unida a la 2 entregas anteriores), forma un cierre epico de la saga.-Excelente Gameplay.-Excelentes Graficos (los efectos de luz, de lo mejor que hay en PS3).-Mucha diversion.CONS:Duracion (que no es lo mismo que durabilidad) el modo historia se puede culminar entre 9 y 12 horas, muy poco.. pero en su favor tienes que esas 12 horas seran de pura adrenalina, diversion, jefes epicos, historia trepidante..PD:Si deseas disfrutar de este juego mas aun te recomiendo que compres primeroGod of War: Collection, de verdad que no te arrepentiras, y junto con este, hacen un JUEGO EPICO!
Aunque no he podido utilizar todas las caracter&iacute;sticas del juego, en sus intrucciones advierte que puede haber problemas de compatibilidad con Los Sims y la expansi&oacute;n Los Sims Universitarios sino se siguen las recomendaciones de instalaci&oacute;n.Por otro lado, he bajado mas de 1000 objetos, personajes, ropas, formas de ojos, maquillaje, etc de la p&aacute;gina WDS y al comenzar el juego advierte que puede haber problemas con algunas de esas descargas y las tengo deshabilitadas mientras conozco totalmente el juego.La empresa EA Games ofrece Online un programa para chequear si las descargas est&aacute;n comprobadas y registradas en su base de datos, pero a&uacute;n as&iacute; el juego Los Sims 2 Noct&aacute;mbulos advierte que pese a esta comprobaci&oacute;n puede haber inestabilidad en el juego.Las nuevas herramientas de construcci&oacute;n son maravillosas, as&iacute; como la creaci&oacute;n de los centros nocturnos.
Un juego para toda la familia, entretenido y ademas promueve la creatividad enormemente.Quizas todo su potencial estan mas alla de las capacidades de un ni&ntilde;o de 8 o menos, sin embargo la diversion que brinda es suficiente para recomendarlo a ni&ntilde;os de esa edad.Un buena introduccion a comunidades virtuales para los menores donde no solo expresan su personalidad con atuendos y demas, sino que desarrollan la imaginacion creando mundos propios que por mas simple que sean los reconfortan al saber que pueden compartirlos.Definitivamente recomendable si se tienen ni&ntilde;os, para adultos creo que la mayor diversion se obtiene compartiendo con ellos en este Pegue&ntilde;o Gran Mundo que es LBP.
Desde hace rato estos t&iacute;tulo me hab&iacute;an aburrido, sin embargo al leer algunos review en p&aacute;ginas especializadas me llam&oacute; la atenci&oacute;n los comentarios positivos que ten&iacute;a el juego, digamos que esto me anim&oacute; a adquirirlo. Oh sorpresa! todo los comentarios estaban en lo correcto. Definitivamente este juego rescata la escencia de la saga, la escencia de un juego arcade de autos de carrera. Creanme, vale la pena tenerlo, adem&aacute;s dificilmente es un juego que pierda el replay value ya que en todo momento se presenta un reto distinto.Adem&aacute;s los gr&aacute;ficos est&aacute;n muy buenos.Recomendado al 100%
Es el control oficial de la videoconsola, punto. No hay uno mejor, tiene las mismas lineas de diseno que han funcionado desde el Original Playstation. Lo unico que no es muy comodo son los gatillos L2 y R2, de verdad de que en algunos juegos no terminan de encajar con el gameplay, pero todo es cuestion tambien de que uso les den los juegos. Exelente diseno, comodo y bien construido, duradero, con tecnologia  bluetooth (10ft.) y con bateria de iones de litio. Ah y el mejor precio en amazon.com (el mio costo 39.99$).El mando de tu PS3, es este!. El Dualshock 3.
un demo jugable lo hace uno pensar que no necesita el juego pues te puedes pasar horas y horas divirtiendote con elpero una vez sumido en el juego siempre llega la cosquilla de otros mundos, otras variaciones, etc.ya compre el juego a un excelente precio y ahora la cosquilla me da por los adds-on disponiblesmi unica queja es que uno acostumbrado a jugar "Capturando la Bandera" en el demo, como que decepciona que la mayoria de las partidas creadas por los usuarios sean de Death Match individual
para jugar este juego!! tienes que tener internet!! sin internet no se puede jugar!! eso es la unika queja!! jajaja pero el juego es increible!! nunk se aburriran de el!! cada partido es diferente! unos ladilla pero otros son increibles!! es muy bueno!! y esta version es mejor por que no consume memoria en el play trae el headset para comunicarse con la gente!! es muy bueno!
Creo que definitivamente es un producto de un alto valor, pero creo que vale lo que uno paga por el, mis hijos la pasan de lo mejor jugando, yo tambi&eacute;n y adem&aacute;s podemos ver peliculas en familia y tener acceso a todos los portales que necesito en internet con la pantalla de mi TV como monitor! Si creo que los juegos deberian de valer menos.

Like many of you, I spent a lot of money for my LCD TV several years ago. When Sony announced their firmware update that allowed for 3D gaming and viewing of 3D Blu-Ray movies, I was tempted to buy another widescreen TV, but couldn't justify shelling out a few thousand more dollars for it. 3D would have to wait.Sony did something clever with this product. They bundled a 24" monitor with 3D glasses, the game Motorstorm Apocalypse, and an HDMI cable and priced it under $500. Suddenly it was a lot more affordable.The monitor comes packaged in a large box with a carrying handle (another benefit of ordering a smaller TV is that you don't need a crew of people to carry it upstairs). There's a slight amount of assembly required, which is a snap (literally). You attach the monitor to the stand and the stand to the base. Then, you just plug it into AC (the power cord is only about 5 feet, which was a bit small for my needs), and then plug the HDMI cable from your PS3 to the unit.It took me a while to find the power button, which is on the back of the unit to the right. There are six buttons in total: a power button, an input selector button (which switches between two HDMI connectors and one set of component (yPbPr) connectors), two volume buttons, a menu button, and a 3D button. They're all pretty generically shaped and lined up in one column, but to help you out an on-screen diagram will pop up when you press one to make sure you're pressing the right one. From the menu you can adjust the picture, including Backlight (0 to 10) and Picture Mode (dynamic, standard, cinema). You can also define a custom picture mode, setting your own brightness, contrast, color, hue, sharpness, and color temperature. It can be quite a pain to adjust menu settings with the buttons behind the unit, but you get used to it soon enough.The PS3 recognized the monitor immediately. I was pleasantly surprised by the crispness of the display. The colors and clarity on the LED display were definitely deeper and crisper than my current LCD TV. Likewise, the sound was powerful (it has 2 channel stereo output at 3W and a subwoofer at 5W built in).The 3D glasses come in a separate felt pouch, and the lenses come protected with some plastic over them (you pull off the plastic with convenient pull-tabs). It took me a while to figure out how to turn them on--there's a power switch on the inside for "battery" and then a separate power button on top, both of which need to be switched on. I was very happy to see a micro-USB connector on top (you need to pry open a little door to see it). I was afraid that like other Sony 3D glasses it'd be powered by a watch battery, but it looks like these glasses can be charged. Note that the connector is a smaller micro-USB connector and not a mini-USB such as the one used to charge the Dualshock and Move controllers. But happily there's a small USB-to-micro-USB cable included. I wear glasses, but the 3D glasses fit comfortably over them.I popped in the game "MLB: The Show 11" to test it out. No 3D. I went to the menu options, and the 3D option was greyed out. I finally realized that I had to go to the PS3 menu under "Settings", and select Video Output Settings > HDMI > Auto and set the screen to 24 inches before 3D would be enabled. Once I did that I returned to the game where now I saw all kinds of new disclaimer screens I didn't see before referencing 3D.Within the game, I adjusted the 3D settings. The first settings I tried had a lot of ghosting. But by adjusting the sliders a little I finally got a picture that was absolutely perfect. I wish that Sony had a "universal" setting instead of having us control it game-by-game, but bottom line, if the game developer did it right you will have control over the depth of 3D you can see.Next, I tried a 3D Blu-Ray which I happened to get today in the mail, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1. The disc started up and went right into 3D mode, with the opening menu gloriously popping out of the screen. It was a clean, crisp picture with no ghosting as far as I could tell. As is typical with these active 3D glasses, the picture was very dark even with the backlight set at maximum (it's like watching a TV screen with sunglasses). But if you sit close enough to the TV and/or adjust the menu settings, you should find a viewing setting that's comfortable.Last, I tried connecting it to my laptop, which happens to have an HDMI output jack. To my delight, I was able to go to YouTube's 3D channel, play videos with the "side by side" viewing method, adjust the 3D mode of the TV, and see the videos in full 3D! Not surprisingly, the picture quality, resolution and color fidelity were excellent. I hadn't planned on it, but I will be most likely be making this my second computer monitor of choice.The set does support "SimulView", which allows two people to play a game watching the same screen with both players seeing their own (2D) view of the game. I wasn't able to test because I didn't buy a second pair of glasses (which is kind of pricey at $70), but I'll update this review once I do.To sum up, I was honestly a little afraid that at this price Sony might try to push a cheap TV on the masses. But everything about this set screams high quality, from the crisp picture, to the 176/176 viewing angle (meaning that multiple people can be between 2-8 feet from the screen and still see perfect 3D as long as they all have the 3D glasses), to the 5000:1 contrast ratio and 240 Hz refresh rate. Aesthetically, it's quite gorgeous too--the black, polished screen really looks distinctive, especially next to the sleek lines of the PS3 itself. And surprisingly, I put the 24" TV next to my 42" LCD and didn't really miss the fact too much that it was smaller (granted, I grew up watching a 25" cathode ray tube TV).The one possible caveat I'd have about this set is what I'd have about all 3D sets--there are some people who might experience some mild-to-severe nausea. For this reason, I'd recommend you play at a friend's house or spend a good couple of minutes in front of a store display to make sure you're not one of those who are affected. For me, I experienced a tiny bit of nausea, but I'll admit that the coolness factor definitely made up for it. Worst comes to worst, you can switch off the 3D and still have a very high quality LED display.One other thing to note is that this isn't a "TV", as there's no TV tuner. But with the extra HDMI connector, you can easily plug in a TiVo or a cable box. Ironically, I also plugged in an Xbox 360 using the component cables, and that picture looks crisp as well.Long story short, if you've been tempted to try out 3D, this makes an excellent entry-level display.Unfortunately, I have to end my review with a couple words about Amazon. I have always been blown away by Amazon's customer service and I routinely pre-order games and systems from them. In this case, I had ordered the PS3 Display back in September, because they promised that everyone who pre-ordered would get a free copy of Resistance 3. Lo and behold, like many of you probably did, I found out that my order was cancelled--my invoice of September had the correct price of $499.99, but some klutz in Amazon evidently repriced it after I ordered it at $4.99 and then $49.99. Because of this, my order was cancelled. I called their customer service, and the rep "Bill" was very kind and understanding, but said he had to "check with his manager" to see what he could do. A few minutes later I get a generic email basically telling me tough luck and that I should re-place my order--which meant I wouldn't get it for another few weeks AND I wouldn't get the free game. No apology or anything. Needless to say, I immediately drove to GameStop where they gave me the system and a free copy of Uncharted 3 to boot. My message to Amazon--clean up your act or you'll see a lot more people doing the same.
I have big hands, and being raised with PlayStation controllers has molded my hands to be perfectly comfortable with them. I have NEVER had any hand cramps or soreness from any Dualshock controllers. Although the PSP and Vita put my pinkies to sleep after awhile. Anyways, on to the new controller and improvements I have noticed in my limited time testing it on the PS3 mostly with BF3.Picked this up from GameStop today (they had the PS Eye in stock also) and am not disappointed!THE DESIGN-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The DS4 feels like it was custom molded for my hands! It's amazing! All the buttons are easily reachable during a BF3 match except for the Options and Share buttons, which is a problem for BF3 on PS3 because Select (Share) is for spotting, but this is not an issue for the PS4.The Touchpad is also very comfortable to reach for.I was disappointed when I heard the textured half was plastic (not rubber), but in my hands it feels like rubber, so I am happy now.The gloss surface for the D-pad and face buttons feels great.THE BUTTONS------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So the face buttons are now digital and not analog, I noticed no difference in BF3, sometimes they actually felt snappier.The D-pad feels better, and has a dent in the center, though I will miss the texture like the DS3s has.R1 and L1 feel snappier (could be because it's new).R2 and L2 are much easier to grip due to the new curve. They also have a stopping point inside the controller before the buttons lip hits the frame like the DS3, so you know when it's pulled all the way. That may be enough to ween me off of R1 for the trigger!I thought the Touchpads clickable button would be bad, but it actually is very well done. The "click" feels the same wherever you press it!The PS Button is smaller and solid black.The sticks are AWESOME! They are actually smaller in circumference and shorter in height, but it's not that noticeable. The texture of the sticks and the caved in center made it almost impossible for me to slip off. My biggest plus is the accuracy you can get with this thing! Even on BF3 on the PS3 I could turn my sensitivity up with no problem!L3 and R3 are much easier to press while the sticks are facing out (example; walking to running on BF3).Share and Options are definitely not for use as in game buttons. They are raised just enough to find them, but not by accident. I will always miss Start and Select though.OTHER--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Light Bar is bright but faced down so you don't notice it unless it were to flash or something. Red and blue flashing lights for NFS would be SWEET!It uses a Micro USB (not included).I was unable to test the Light Bar, Touchpad, vibration, headsets, or any other functions that require the PS4.Sorry guys! I don't really have anything bad to say about this controller! Maybe once I get my PS4, but for now it's awesome!Makes me want to get BF4 on PS3 just to be ready for PS4!Hope this review helped someone, and yes I am a shi**y writer. Anyways hit me up if you guys have a question or want me to test something!WHAT WORKS ON PS3? ONLY the Analog Sticks, Face Buttons, D-pad, L and R 1, 2 & 3, and Share/Options as Select/Start. MUST be plugged in via USB port on PS3. Could not pair as Bluetooth device in Settings or use as Audio device. ONLY WORKS ON CERTAIN PS3 GAMES.
The following are my conclusions and observations following several hours of testing. It is possible that I missed a feature or two but I am quite confident that I was able to test all the major ones.The setup and first impressions:-------------------------------I don't know why, I imagined a bigger device. I am pleased to note that the keypad is a lot thinner than I imagined - about half an inch thick and pretty light.It fits nicely on top of any standard PS3 controller thanks to a clamp that, once it clicks in, it makes the keypad appear as if it was part of the controller's body. The three controller buttons that it covers: PS3, Select and Start are present on the pad at their expected locations but they only work when the keypad is attached to the controller. All other buttons work regardless of the keypad being attached or detached.The keyboard is okay but it's better suited for larger hands (or long thumbs). As a Blackberry user, I find this keyboard less comfortable than that of a classic Blackberry - but I've been using Blackberies for almost 10 years already so I may be a little bit spoiled or maybe biased toward their ergonomics.As far as workmanship is concerned, my impression is one of a well-built, durable device. It integrates well, visually and functionally with the PS3 controllers.The setup:----------After a couple of hours of charging through the USB port (cable not included), the keypad is ready to use. Once the On/Off switch is set to On, all that's needed is for the keypad to be connected to the PS3 through a USB cable and the pairing is done automatically.The workings:-------------The keypad operates in two modes: as a keyboard or, interestingly, as a touch pad.In keyboard mode, you get a QWERTY keyboard with well separated, round little keys. The letters, numeric and punctuation keys are where you would expect them to be but the special keys are not exactly at their familiar places and some of the less essential ones (PgUp, PgDn, End, Home and the function keys) are missing. Special characters can be entered with the help of 2 modifier keys (the Blue and the Orange).Three special keys allow you to enable the touch pad mode or quickly jump to your PS3 message box or friends list icons - I did not find the last 2 very useful.Until you make yourself familiar with some of the less obvious key combinations it's a good idea to save the instructions pamphlet (a 17"x11" folded sheet) found in the package.The touch pad mode is very interesting in that, after pressing the 'touch pad key', the keyboard is disabled and a section of the keyboard emulates a laptop's touch pad and the 2 cursor keys emulate mouse buttons and you can interact with your environment as if you were using a mouse.I am a 'knob' person as far as mouse emulation is concerned but, based on my testing, the touch pad mode, while interesting and innovative, is not very well implemented. For example, while in Browser mode, it does not allow you to scroll down your browser window, something that is easily and intuitively accomplished with the R3/L3 analog sticks. The cursor, when controlled with the touch pad was jumpy, either moving from one corner of the window to another or, sometimes, not moving at all. The good news is that all the controller buttons, including the sticks, are fully functional all the time so, people like me, won't have to use the touch pad.Brief evaluation:-----------------+ Bluetooth device, does not require dongles or wires+ Replaces a full-size keyboard, well suited for entering passwords or brief messages+ Perfectly integrated, physically and functionally with the PS3 controller - generally, it does not interfere with game play+ Rechargeable battery+ According to Sony (not tested by me) it can be paired with other Bluetooth devices (don't lose that manual)- Adds weight to the controller- Some of the special keys are placed at unfamiliar locations- Keys 'real estate' wasted by assigning 2 keys to jump to the message box and the friends list- Touch pad does not work very well- Small hands may find it a bit uncomfortableBefore I started writing this review, I thought I was going to award this keypad 3 stars but, once I listed the pros and the cons I see that the negatives are relatively minor. The major disappointment is the touch pad but it's not something that I am going to miss because I am already happy with the R3/L3. 3.5 stars should be the fair score but I am rounding it up to 4 because my overall impression is positive.With HOME now a reality, this is likely to become an increasingly useful add-on.
Having used both the PS4 and Xbox One controller and their respective predecessor, here is my take on the PS4 controller. Compared to the PS3 controller, the redesigned PS4 controller is better in almost every way possible. Instead of being an evolution of the PS3 controller, this one is a completely revolutionary design. The biggest difference of this controller is the touchpad on it, and while not many games have incorporated the use of the touchpad at launch (Killzone is one the games that does have touchpad support) there is a huge potential for games to incorporate the use of the touchpad. The inclusion of a speaker on the controller is another nice feature with big potential, so far I have only seen it be used in Resogun and Killzone (playing audiolog). There is a light in the front of the controller that has replaced the controller 1, 2, 3, 4 light on the PS3, again another feature that has potential depending on how developers use it. In FIFA, the color of the light represent the color of the user controlled player in the game, Player 1 is red, Player 2 is blue, etc. Now it is up to game developers to include the touchpad functionality and use the controller&#8217;s speaker in their game. It will be very interesting to see how those features will be implemented. The controller is also more ergonomical this time around. Since I have fairly large hands, I have found the Xbox controllers to be more comfortable to use compared to the Playstation controller. However, that is a wash this time around as the overall design of the PS4 controller is very comfortable and ergonomic. The triggers are now designed to contour to your fingers similar to the Xbox controller making it so that your trigger fingers sit their nicely and reduce the chance of slippage from previous design, good for those playing with sweaty or greasy fingers and all around a more thoughtful design. The back button is now replaced by a share button for sharing all your glorious moments online for your friends to see while the start button is replaced by the option button. At first locating and hitting the option button can be frustrating due to it&#8217;s small size and the fact that it is not raised from the controller&#8217;s surface. However after using the controller, you&#8217;ll get the hang of it and that will no longer be a big issue. So now for the gripes against this controller. The first issue with it is the durability issue and there are many reviewers saying that the rubber, especially on the left joystick/thumbstick is degrading. I&#8217;ve had the controller for two months and the rubber is already coming off. The second issue is the battery life. Compared to the PS3, Xbox One, and Xbox 360, the battery life is the worst on the PS4 controller. Hopefully Sony will release a revision of the controller that addresses these two issues because this controller has great potential. Only time will tell.
Caution: This will be a totally biased review. I love Sony PlayStation & I love this display monitor. Also, I will not repeat the entire product description here. I will, however, mention the relevant aspects of my own experience with this product.Firstly, the physical properties: The 24 inch screen may be small for many tastes, but if you live in a small apartment, a dorm room, or don't mind a TV in the bedroom, it makes for a nice fit. The picture quality is excellent - clean, vibrant colors, all in beautiful high definition 1080p, 240hz with 3D capability. The draw back is that the small size requires some rather close up viewing, especially when using it for 3D viewing, so bigger rooms and easy chairs don't allow for the full pleasure of the display. The display is also light in weight, so it travels quite nicely, which is good for me (I work at a paramedic station on 24 hour shifts, so I often take the display & PS3 with me).Set up with a PS3 is a piece of cake when using an HDMI cable - I cannot imagine it's that much more difficult using a component cable or with another gaming system, cable box, or other video source. The display has two HDMI inputs and one component (5 prong) input. Sorry, no 3 prong RCA cable inputs. Another plus, with an HDMI setup, is that turning on the PS3 via Dual Shock 3 controller turns on the whole setup - good for the fundamentally lazy...like me.The display has the exciting feature of Simulview which eliminates the need for split screen multiplayer gaming. It does require the use of the 3D glasses, but you get to play co-ops & on-line multiplayers with an entire screen all to yourself. The big disappointment is that not very many games, two or three so far, support Simulview.The speakers make some decent sound for a small display. Again, though, the small size requires some proximity for optimum enjoyment. However, if you have some decent speakers or head-phones that use a standard 3.5mm head-phone jack, then sound is no longer that much of an issue.The interface buttons are a bit of a challenge. I just memorized that the top button is the power button and the button with the little bead is the up-volume button. The rest is fluff that the Sony BD Remote covers nicely.Out of the box, you get the display, a stand (it is not built to accept a wall mount), an HDMI cable, a pair of 3D glasses w/ charging cable, and Motorstorm Apocalypse. With the price down to around $200, I think the display is a steal for those with a desire to experience HD & 3D on a modest budget & in small dwellings.
PREAMBLEI have nearly every console ever made and controllers for most of them...even esoteric ONEs such as the Nintendo "Wavebird" and the more professionally made 3rd party controllers such as the Logitech ONEs with IR receivers for PS2 and the original XBOX (which tended to have some degree of noticeable input lag). Prior to the PS4 DS4 controller, I would say the 360 was the most solidly built controller ever. It felt great to hold and I felt like I couldn't break it with my bare hands the way I could with the PS3 controller...I love controllers.MICROSOFT SPENDS MORE TO GET LESSMS reportedly spent $100,000,000 developing the XBOX ONE controller. They spent 100mil to develop a controller inferior and less ergonomic to the 360 controller. My "DAY ONE" XBOX ONE controller has a less solid, more "plastic-y" feel to it (similar to the PS3 controller) and the seams tend to cave in as I grip it. I am forced to grip it much much harder because it's wider (for no apparent reason) and that forces my hands apart. Worse, as professional critics have noted, the shoulder (bumper) buttons no longer depress on the outer portions of the button - can't fathom the stupidity of that. If you're used to being able to push the shoulder buttons in anywhere (as you should) you'll screw this up over and over again and fail to throw a grenade or do whatever action the button is supposed to do. I see no intelligent design reason for this. It's just stupid. The only big noticeable things the ONE controller has over competitors are trigger rumble and a removable battery.XBOX ONE CONTROLLER IMPROVEMENTSThe XBOX ONE controller dead zones are supposed to be better and the D-pad is improved. I bet that will please the folks that play stuff in Major League Gaming, but I never really cared about those things to begin with and 360 controller revisions had already fixed the d-pad with a cool interesting transforming method. I can't tell if latency or lag has improved yet. They made it uncomfortable to hold and nearly no functionality was added. NOTE: my TITANFALL controller (which you'd think would be identical) seems to not have the same caving-in-at-the-seams problem the DAY ONE controller has...So there's that...XBOX ONE CONTROLLER / OS INTERFACE PROBLEMS & REDUNDANT BUTTONSEven the way the controller interfaces with the ONE OS is worse. The ONE OS stupidly didn't launch with a battery indicator (patched later) but the controller itself still has no low battery warning indicator (the 360 controller did). So if you're in the heat of battle and the team is counting on you for the big win, your controller will just die randomly...Thanks Obama.Also, the ONE controller has a menu button (previously start) which mimics current website and mobile standards (which is good), another redundant button (previously back) and I don't even know what the hell you call it (app switcher button?) and yet another to turn on/off (the classic middle X button). The middle X button used to be more functional. Tapping it would take you to a very fast, responsive and convenient text-based shortcut menu on the 360, but this was abandoned in the ONE OS rendering the button less useful and more redundant. Worse, when you receive a game/party invite, you're supposed to HOLD the middle X button (IT TELLS YOU TO DO THIS). Because of buggy OS latency problems here, this never works fast enough and takes you to the "turn off" menu instead. You're supposed to only hold it down for a few seconds, but IT DOES NOT SAY THAT - you'll learn the hard way and maybe accidentally turn of your system (this still has not been patched). If you're coming from PS to XBOX or are new to XBOX, these buttons may not make any intuitive sense to you at all, may be difficult to get used to and game/party invites will confuse you...Because of all this crap, these 3 buttons really should be ONE button the way it is on the PS4...There isn't enough functionality to them thus there isn't a good reason for them to all exist...A LOT OF PS4 CONTROLLER IMPROVEMENTS AND INTELLIGENT BUTTON PLACEMENTThe PS4 controller feels much more solid than the PS3 controller and yet is light and pleasant to hold. It is improved in every way to its predecessor, has better button placement and more functionality than the XBOX ONE controller. I like the 1-button-tap in the middle to take you to the dashboard (or back to your last app if already at the dashboard) or hold-down-to-turn-off. I don't particularly like the PS4 dashboard (XBOX ONE wins here hands down in my opinion) but this review is for the controller not the dashboard...The PS4 controller has new (or moved) buttons near the shoulder buttons that are OUT OF THE WAY and innocuous. Don't use the share button if you don't want to and you probably won't ever hit it by accident.Many people have remarked that they don't like the big interactive light bar but I find it pleasant and informative (bad things happening on screen = red, good things = green and so on). Nevertheless Sony SHOULD LET YOU TURN THE DAMN THING OFF for those that hate it and Sony claims the won't or can't. That's dumb.I like the speaker addition. This was always a cool function with the Wiimote (a thing it had over other controllers at that time) and now Sony has it as well. This gives developers the ability to play 1 thing over the controller and another over other speakers (audio logs in KILLZONE for example). Also has a built in stereo headphone jack. XBOX ONE controller - you have to buy some extra thing for this and it sticks out, adds major girth and is obtrusive...The clickable touchpad is a great addition. As much controller real estate as it consumes, it's still relatively out of the way. I wonder if they could even improve it more and make it a TOUCHSCREEN! Maybe down the road when the added costs wouldn't be prohibitive.The sticks are much improved, less floaty and wobbly.The SIXAXIS gyro thing was the only benefit the PS3 controller had over the 360 in my opinion...and I believe this tech was changed for the PS4. But so far I haven't played anything that uses it, so I can't comment on it...It was always a cool function but most games never used it and a few that tried to implement it in a serious fashion made gamers hate it and wish it was dead (LAIR).One of the dumber things about PS3 was that the trigger buttons were often not used AS TRIGGERS in shooters - the shoulder buttons were instead confoundedly used for this. As someone that is fairly console neutral, I can't tell you how annoying it is to pop in a shooter, proceed to hit THAT BIG THING THAT LOOKS LIKE A FREAKING TRIGGER ON A GUN to shoot an alien or whatever-it-is and instead a grenade or some other dumb thing pops out. The PS3 trigger buttons themselves were horrible anyway. Holding them down would cause the entire controller to move which is NOT what you want in a twitch shooter or intensely hard gaming session. Somebody at Sony apparently got a brain and fixed all this...Note, there are no real PS4 unimprovements, the way there are with the ONE (other than the lightbar annoyance - which doesn't personally annoy me).Other than turning the touchpad into a touchscreen, the only way I could imagine they could improve this thing is to add a microphone...PS4 CONTROLLER FOR THE WIN.
Coming from the Xbox 360 controller I immediately hated the Dual Shock 4. It just didn't feel right. After a few hours of use I honestly don't think I could go back. I don't find my hands cramping or falling asleep like I did with the Xbox controller. Both of my thumbs are right where I need to be and the symmetry feels so right.I started off with Killzone: Shadow Fall and was soon greeted by my first negative, the touch pad. The touch pad is in a horrible spot, it should have been below your thumb sticks where your thumbs are already perfectly placed and can simply do a quick swipe. Instead the touch pad is above them; meaning when I want to use it I have to &#34;tweak&#34; the controller sideways a bit removing my hand from the joystick area and trigger. Considering the OWL is a big part of the Killzone: SF game, I found myself not using it in battle as I should because it required me to hide or to get killed while taking my hand away from the joystick/trigger. Horrible horrible horrible placement in my opinion.The controller also has poor battery life. I remember charging my 3rd party Xbox 360 batteries up every few days, however, it seems like the DS4 controller has to be charged about every two days or every day for long day game sessions. This isn't that big of a deal for me as I'm near a laptop which I can charge via USB anytime.The light bar looks cool at first, but unless you are using the camera, it's useless and just drains battery more. There should be an option to turn it off, but currently there is not. Granted LED's don't use much power, but the option should be there nonetheless.The textured back of the PS4 feels nice, but it is easily scratched. I think a rubberized non slip grip on the handles would have been a better choice.I was pleasantly surprised that I could pipe all game audio along with the mic through the DS4. Any headset using a 3.5mm or 2.5mm with 3.5mm adapter will work. This is wonderful as I can plug in my headset with built in mic, Logitech UE-6000, and have an awesome gaming headset that isn't just dedicated to gaming. It also means I can setup my 24&#34; Playstation monitor on the end table and not get fussed about playing games as I'm right there with the fiancee while she's watching those lovely horribly scripted dramas, Keeping up with the Kardashians, that I can't stand.
I've been looking forward to holding the DualShock 4 since E3, because while holding a controller attached to a demo unit on a crowded showfloor is one thing, having it in the comfort of your home is another. In fact, I spent ten minutes just switching back and forth between the DualShock 3 and 4, just to see how much improved the new controller is. Of course, I would do this before I had to review a PlayStation 3 game. Which is a shame, because the DualShock 3 feels like a boxy toy compared to its successor. It's like getting new glasses: your old ones feel fine, until you've tried the new ones on.The DualShock 4 feels slightly thinner and longer than the DS3, but the new handgrips are larger and feel far more comfortable in my huge hands. The analog sticks are tighter than they were on the DS3, with a feeling of resistance approaching a 360 controller. Sony has made sticks slightly shorter and added a dip in the center of each one so your thumbs won't slip off. The button click on the analog sticks is not a deep as the DualShock 3, but still noticeable. The new directional pad has a more pronounced dip in the center that draws your thumb there naturally, but otherwise it feels like the same single piece rocker that we've had since the first PlayStation controller.As Sony confirmed months ago, the face buttons are digital instead of analog this time; no one really used them for analog purposes, so it saves data bandwidth to switch them back to digital. They're closer together on the DualShock 4, making a tighter diamond shape.&#34;With the DualShock 3, we were able to get analog data, which games didn't really use,&#34; Sony Computer Entertainment product planning manager Toshimasa Aoki told VentureBeat last week. &#34;For DualShock 4, we deleted that, and now it's all digital. The mechanism inside is a little different, and the data that games get is different.&#34;The R1 and L1 buttons are a little rounder, while the R2 and L2 trigger have undergone a complete redesign. The triggers are now concave instead of convex; my fingers fell right into place as soon as I picked up the DualShock 4. Even outside of general use, the concave triggers have a second benefit: fewer accidental button presses when you set down the controller, since it now rests on the edge of triggers. R2 and L2 on the DualShock 3 have a sense of greater resistance and springy-ness as they reach their full press, but on the DS4 it's smooth all the way through. As a tiny bonus the names on the top buttons actually face toward you when you're using the controller.To charge your DualShock 3 you used a mini-USB cable, but the DualShock 4 switches to micro-USB. So if you've purchased a non-Apple portable electronic device in the past four years, you're probably good to go. The controller itself does not come with a micro-USB cable, but one will come with the PlayStation 4. I have a ton of them lying around the house, so I grabbed one and plugged it into my PC to see what would happen.My Windows 8.1 PC did recognize the controller as a generic USB controller with a total of fourteen buttons: Square, X, Circle, Triangle, L1, R1, L2, R2, L3, R3, Share, Options, the PS button, and the click of the touchpad. The touchpad itself doesn't register and the D-Pad comes up as the &#34;point of view hat&#34;, like a flight stick. Oddly enough, the L2 and R2 triggers show up as buttons and change X and Y Rotation in Windows settings. The controller can also be reportedly be paired to a PC with Bluetooth, but I was unable to test that as my motherboard lacks a Bluetooth connection. Fun fact: the controller LED glows amber when hooked into a PC.I tried it out with a few PC games, but the results weren't all that great. Saints Row IV saw the controller and everything worked... except for the fact that the analog stick was inverted. Pushing down on the stick would make my character more forward and vice versa. There was no way to fix this using the in-game menus. Batman: Arkham City and Far Cry 3 were complete non-starters and neither game recognized the controller at all. Adult Swim's Soundodger worked fine. If you're getting this as a PC controller, I'd say your best bet is to wait. Sony needs to release some PC drivers for the DualShock 4 and I hear they're busy launching a console.All in all, I think Sony has done a great job with the new DualShock. It's a marked improvement over the DualShock 3, but I'll need more time with an actual game in order to deliver my final verdict. That said Sony's off to a great start, and in previous demos, I've preferred the DualShock 4 to the Xbox One controller.
After three console generations Sony finally decided to redesign their Dualshock controller. It's been a long wait but I can say for certainty this is their best controller by far. The Dualshock 4 has fixed all the nagging issues from all the previous DS controllers by providing a better ergonomic form, vastly improved L2/R2 triggers, firmer body structure, speaker, and tighter analog sticks. It's very hard to explain and harder to judge with words, but once held in the palm, the improvements are felt instantaneously.Positives:- The elongated handles are larger and oval in shape unlike previous controllers. This forms and contours to the back of your palm as well as the fingers to provide an excellent grip.- The DS4 is larger, sturdier, and heavier than previous controller. The mold is also tighter and when held it doesn't creak like previous controllers.- The L2/R2 triggers are vastly improved because they are finally convex instead of concave. Not only are the triggers convex but there is a slight curve upwards that mold perfectly to your index finger when pressed down. It's a simple little design that has a large impact. Your finger will no longer slip off the trigger when pressed especially for prolong time.- The analog sticks are now shorter, made of different material, spaced a little further apart, has tighter resistance, and has indentation in the middle. It really makes a large difference, the material and indication keeps your fingers from slipping off. The shorter sticks keeps your thumbs at a comfortable level although subtly, and the tighter resistance feels better on the thumbs.- The new speaker on the controller actually adds a new sense of immersion as well as convenience for chatting. Resogun is a great example of the speaker feature as directives are communicated through the speaker. Flower is another example of a great feature as you can hear the swooshing of the wind coming out of the speaker.- The back of the controller is design with a textured pattern to help with grip. It's not made of different material as the front face or rubberized, but the texture really helps to keep the palm settled.Cons:- The controller has a light bar on the top placed slanted from the front. It's great because it keeps the light from being distracting, but the glow will illuminate if you play in a darken room. Though it's a nice feature, I don't see how it's beneficial unless you play in the dark as you won't be able to see the light in normal playing conditions.- There's also a new track pack placed in the middle of the controller. There's not much to say about the track pack as there's hasnt' been an application that fully utilizes it yet besides the playroom (an interactive tech demo). As with the light bar, it's a nice feature but one that's unnecessary so far.- The battery for the controller has less of a charge than previous controllers. I notice it only lasts about a days worth of gameplay before re-charging is required as oppose to the DS3 where it can vary between 2-3 days.All in all, I love the new DS4. It's such a vast improvement and it feels great in your hands. In fact, once you try out the DS4 you'll notice how horrible and cheap the DS3 feels.
Okay, so the Playstation 4 (PS4) has been out for a few days, now and there has been some drama over its release. There have been some issues with it, but more or less I just want to give my personal experiences with and thoughts about it.Bottom line up front: I love it.There is no doubt that there are pros and cons to buying the PS4 system. First of all, I will address the more negative stuff just to get it out of the way.Cons (as they pertain to the system during the launch weekend):1) Headset integration: my biggest pet peeve with the system right now is that they did not make it compatible with current gaming headsets. People spend hundreds of dollars on just a single headset, sometimes, and for those to not be fully integrated on day one is a letdown. The only real solution(s) to that is:(a) Buy theTurtle Beach Ear Force PX4, which were designed with the PS4 in mind. (Be careful to read all of the instructions online with regard to how to set these up. If you're having trouble, here is a link that will step you through what the PS4 settings ought to be: [...] I bought these, and once I figured the settings out, I have really been enjoying them. The one down side to using these with the proper settings is that the sound that your system sends to the speaker on your controller won't be routed through your headset. If you do route those sounds to your headset, for some reason, I think it overloads the headset and it can't handle all of that information, so it only sends intermittent signals to the headset at that point until you fix the settings.(b) Use the included mono earbud (singular) with built-in microphone that plugs into the Dualshock 4(c) Use some Apple-like earbuds with a built-in microphone (like the ones that come standard, now) because those actually work - I tested it.-Playstation Plus (PS+) is now required for online multiplayer. This isn't as big of a deal, though, because for one, it's still cheaper than Xbox Live Gold subscriptions, and you can still do everything on your PS4 without PS+ except playing games online with other people. I'll address some of the perks of PS+ in the "Pros" section below, though.2) General bugs/kinks that need to be worked out: As I go about exploring and utilizing my new source of joy and adventure, I do notice bugs here or there. One example is the "What's New" tab when you first log on to the system. It is supposed to show you all of your recent activity on your machine - like if you've streamed your gameplay, or earned a trophy - but mine has only worked once. Besides that one time, I haven't seen anything on my "What's New" tab.3) Social Media: There is no Google+ integration. I really want to see that changed. I want to be able to have my PS4 post a status on my Google+ account just like it does to Twitter and Facebook whenever I earn a new trophy, live stream my game play, or upload a screen shot or video.Here's the deal: Sony has admitted that there have been a number of PS4 that arrived at their new loving homes dead on arrival. The internet has blown up with these complaints and concerns, and to be fair, for those affected, this is a huge concern and they need to know what to do in order to get it taken care of. Which, by the way, one really good resource is this web page: [...] but the issues have been blown out of proportion. Sony has released statements about it and they have isolated the batch of bad PS4 systems. It equates to 0.4% of the systems sold. For math nerds out there, there were 1,000,000 systems sold in the first 24 hours. 0.4% of 1 mil is about 4,000 machines. So, 4,000 machines out of 1,000,000 is a REALLY good track record.So, here's the good stuff, in my opinion.Pros (as they pertain to the system during the launch weekend):1) The system is physically beautiful: It's small, light weight, and simple.2) The Playstation (PS) user interface (UI) has definitely been improved and works wonderfully smooth. I love how easily you can transition between your game (or other app) and the home screen and back. I love how easily accessible everything is. It's intuitive, whereas the PS3 UI was not. Also, all of the system's settings can be found under one single menu heading. So, no more hunting around the UI for the setting menu you're looking for.3) DVD's look as crisp and clear coming out of the PS4 as BluRays do on the PS3. I don't know how this works. I'm not sure what mechanics are at play here, but we have watched a handful of both BluRay and DVD on the PS4 since it arrived last Friday (15 November), and the DVDs play as smooth, crisp, and clear as BluRays.4) PS+: With Sony's PS+ program, you get free junk. There are three or four games available right now on the PS Store for the PS4 that would cost non-PS+ members $15 or more, but they are free to download and use. One game in particular is actually free to everyone, it's called Warframe, but PS+ members get some expansion stuff for free. Also, PS+ is not required to watch media on your Amazon Prime app, or Netflix, Hulu, or whatever other streaming app you like.5) Social media and integration: I love how integrated the PS4 is with Twitter and Facebook.6) Along the lines of social media, there is live streaming: The Xbox One has a very very similar function as the PS4 in this regard, but the PS4 can live stream your game play onto Twitch or Ustream, and it is always recording while you're playing so that if you want to upload a video to Facebook or Twitter, it'll upload up to 15 minutes worth of game play. It also allows you to post screen shots onto your Facebook or Twitter account. You can also watch other gamers' streams directly from your PS4, if you want - AND, in the near future you will be able to go look at someone's live stream, and if you have the same game they do, you'll be able to just hop into their game with them. (They are going to have to push an update to the systems in order for this to work, but this is a function they've advertised for months now and have built the system in order to do this.)7) Sony's attitude towards gamers: This is huge. To be perfectly transparent and honest, this was my biggest deciding factor in buying the PS4. Sony has made it apparent since they announced the PS4 that they made this system with gamers in mind. The innovations they've made and the policies they have established cement this fact. Sony, plus the outpouring of ire on the internet, is the reason Microsoft had to backpedal on some of their policies for the Xbox One which alienated gamers a little in an attempt to lure non-gamers into the gaming console market. I can't emphasize this point enough. Even with the systems that were DOA at launch, Sony has been up front, responsive, and they haven't tried to hide or deny anything. They've admitted that some of their systems are faulty, and every new bug that is discovered, Sony is quickly behind that discovery with a response that they are working to fix it.8) Dualshock 4 controller: When looking at pictures, and comparing those pictures to the Dualshock 3 controller, it is hard to imagine that a new controller that is so similar in design to its predecessor could make an impression; but it did. The very first time I opened my PS4 box, and unwrapped the Dualshock 4, my brain started tingling with endorphins. It was unexpected. But, I think there were three main things (among a handful of things in total) that stood out to me:(a) The first was the material that the controller is made out of. It's smooth, yet it doesn't slip i your hands. It just has this...almost velvety feeling to it. So, I guess you might say that it feels soft, as well as smooth. It just feels good to hold.(b) The buttons and joysticks: the buttons and joysticks are so much more accurate, precise, and smooth. And the new L2 and R2 buttons (the triggers) feel great - and that's coming from a guy who has been converted from the Xbox consoles.(c) The touchpad: So far, my only experience with this is in Killzone Shadow Fall, and even though it was a simple and almost unimaginative use for the touchpad, it clearly works as intended, and it is sensitive and responsive (it is also a clickable/pushable button).When I started gaming on these new consoles, I was an Xbox guy (original Xbox). I stayed with Xbox for the Xbox 360, and it wasn't until I decided Xbox Live Gold wasn't worth the money that I decided to migrate (slowly...very slowly) over to the Playstation family. I only just bought a PS3 maybe 2 years ago. And, it took a lot of adjusting. The PS3 UI wasn't anywhere near as immersive and interesting as the Xbox UI. Games that I loved when I played them on my Xbox 360, I had a really hard time getting into on the PS3. But, now, I feel like I could never go back to Xbox - and mainly because they are losing their focus on gamers, and Sony has kept in touch with it's primary demographic.There is no doubt that the Xbox One has plenty of Pros and plenty of amazing content to offer its customers. But, for me, the choice was clear to gamble on the PS4 when I decided to pre-order a next gen system. And, now that it has launched, even with the hiccups, I am glad that I did. It is an amazing system, and it will only get better over time.

Naughty Dog basically got Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy and smooshed it together with Grand Theft Auto between two pieces of bread, creating a hefty and delicious videogaming sandwich which is sure to provide gamers with a nutritionally good gaming experience. Food references aside, this game blends the qualities of the The Precursor Legacy and GTA; namely the platforming and combat of the former, and the free-roaming and vehicle stealing of the latter. So while Jak II does change things considerably from The Precursor Legacy in terms of overall presentation and gameplay, it still manages to remain faithful to its predecessor. At the end of The Precursor Legacy, Jak, Daxter, Samos the Sage, and his daughter Keira opened a Precursor door atop Gol and Maia's Citadel and stood in awe of what lay within. This game opens with the group back at Samos's Hut with what they found in the door set up outside the hut: a Rift Rider. When they activate it, a portal opens, out of which a swarm of strange flying creatures comes out, along with a large beast who appears to be after one of our heroes. The Rift Rider then takes the group into the portal, with Jak and Daxter getting separated from the other two and landing in a large, industrial metropolis known as Haven City. Is this the future, another planet, or another dimension? Play the game and you'll find out. Anyway, Jak is immediately arrested by the Krimzon Guard, a Storm Trooper-like security force who serve the tyrannical Baron Praxis. Imprisoned for two years, Jak is pumped full of Dark Eco by Praxis, who hopes to create a "dark warrior" to combat the Metal Heads, dark mutants who seek to enter Haven City and slaughter its inhabitants.After being rescued by Daxter, the duo escape into the city and join an Underground resistance whose goal is to dethrone Praxis and free the city, although Jak's goal to stop the baron is driven more by vengeance than the city's well being. By the way, Jak finally speaks in this game. When Jak and Daxter's journey begins, they'll go on missions for the Underground and other interesting characters to sabotage the baron's schemes and defend the city from the Metal Heads. The missions you undertake in this game all vary greatly: you'll shoot down flying enemies and ships inside a gunpod, take part in high speed races and chases, hunt Metal Heads, escort allies to safe zones while outrunning the Krimzon Guard, escape exploding buildings...the list goes on. Most of the missions are also very challenging, and a handful of them are incredibly difficult. The most difficult mission in the game by far has Jak running through a pier with many intersecting walkways and an endless army of Krimzon Guards coming at him from every direction, giving Jak no alternative but to shoot his way out. Despite the game's difficulty, I always found myself itching to undertake the next challenging mission, since they're all a blast to play. The game's enemies and handful of challenging boss fights add further to the game's fun factor. The Krimzon Guard who patrol the city function like cops and will attack you if you attack them or the citizens; even if you accidentally crash into one of them, the city will go on alert and they'll chase and shoot at you. When this happens, you'll have to either outrun the Krimzon Guard or stay out of sight for a few moments until they call off the search. Outside the city, the Metal Heads are your main enemies, and there are many kinds of those creatures: four legged grunts, scorpion things, hornet-like bugs, cloaked hunters, and other freaks of nature; and they're all fun to kill.Jak himself controls the same as he did in the first game, with his jumping, climbing, and fighting abilities all intact. But he's got some new tricks up his sleeve as well. As mentioned earlier, Jak gets to shoot enemies in this game. After the first few missions, Jak gets a morph gun with four different firing modes utilizing Red, Yellow, Blue, and Dark Eco as the ammunition for each mode. He'll start with the Scattergun (shotgun), next the Blaster (rifle), then Vulcan Fury (gatling gun), and finally the Peace Maker (brings instant death to non-boss enemies). Each weapon is useful against certain enemies and specific situations. Also, thanks to Praxis's Dark Eco experiments, Jak can absorb concentrated amounts of Dark Eco from fallen enemies (falling into pools of Dark Eco still brings instant death) and temporarily transform into Dark Jak, where his skin and eyes turn dark and he grows claws and a pair of horns. In this state, Jak attacks faster and harder, and he can utilize Dark Eco to destroy large groups of enemies in one fell swoop with shockwave and electrocution attacks. Traveling in this game is sort of its own adventure. First off, Haven City is HUGE and has lots of winding streets and paths, so you'll have to utilize a handy in-game map and follow icons to your destinations if you're to have any hope of not getting lost.To get around, Jak and Daxter can ride zoomers that are similar to the one in the first game, only in this game there are many different kinds of zoomers, some large and some small. They can either hover just above the ground or ten feet in the air. Jak can..."Jak" zoomers from people or take unused parked ones. Later, Jak gets a jetboard which is slower than a zoomer, but much more maneuverable and is actually needed to traverse certain areas and complete missions. It functions like a skateboard and allows you to do Tony Hawk-like tricks and jumps; you can even hover over pools of Dark Eco with it. Navigating yourself through the city streets can be irritating at first, since they're normally crowded with lots of other people riding zoomers, and the lousy drivers make no attempt to get out of your way if you're moving at high speeds, which several missions require you to do. In fact, it's hard NOT to crash into other zoomers in this game, but it helps build the tension in certain timed missions to know you have to be very careful if you don't want to fail the mission. The game looks great too, whether you're traveling through Haven City's bazaars, ports, slums, sewers, and parks, or if you're outside the city exploring forests, mines, and pumping stations. The character designs are similar to the ones in the first game, only smoother and more detailed. Jak II even retains the first game's cartoony sense of humor, once again utilizing Daxter as its main source of comic relief, while adding somewhat more mature content and language, but nothing offensive or inappropriate. So yeah, this game has an interesting story, beautiful graphics, very challenging and action packed gameplay, and humor. Really, what more could you ask for in a videogame?

Jak and Daxter are back in the conclusion of the Precursor Legacy Trilogy. This game is almost an exact clone of its predecessor in pretty much every aspect. Normally when a videogame sequel is this similar to the previous game, the sequel tends to lose its "freshness". Fortunately, that's not the case for Jak 3, it uses the same gameplay and graphics that made Jak II great, while also adding a few improvements here and there. The story begins with a rather surprising scene: Jak is banished from Haven City and is being left in the middle of the wasteland desert by a council member named Count Veger and his soldiers, despite objections from Jak's friends Daxter, Ashelin, and Pecker. Apparently, the city is holding Jak responsible for the Metal Heads invading the city at the end of the previous game, and even though Baron Praxis and Metal Kor were defeated, the city is still at war with the surviving Metal Heads and previous Krimzon Guard robots, known as KG Deathbots. Jak, accompanied by Daxter and Pecker, is later found by a group of wastelanders and taken to their city, Spargus, where Jak has to prove his worth to the wasteland king Damas by taking part in arena battles in order to be allowed to stay in the city.Jak and Daxter eventually make their way back to Haven City, which is a war zone with Metal Heads and KG Deathbots constantly attacking the previous members of the Underground and Krimzon Guard who now defend the city as the Freedom League. Between dealing with these enemies, proving Jak's innocence, and finding out what the obviously corrupt Count Veger is up to, Jak and Daxter have a lot on their plate. Lucky for them, they've got mad skills and even madder weapons and gadgets that they can use to deal with any challenge. In the wasteland, Jak and Daxter will do missions for the tough but fair Damas, where they'll deal with Marauders and new kinds of Metal Heads as they explore temples, volcanoes, and Metal Head nests. The wasteland is also twice as large as Haven City, and the duo can get around by riding one of several dune buggies of different sizes armed with machine guns, grenade launchers, and so on. One of them can jump 30 feet in the air, allowing Jak and Daxter to reach areas that regular buggies can't reach. Spargus itself is considerably smaller than Haven City and strongly resembles Tatooine from Star Wars. Due to its smaller size, Spargus is easier to go through on foot, however there are plenty of Leaper Lizards that Jak can ride to get to places (they control and move like the Flut Flut from the first game). While it's easier to get around Spargus, it's still possible to accidentally ram into its inhabitants, but since they're all armed warriors, you should be prepared for a firefight if you anger any of them.Haven City is quite different from the way it was in Jak II. Certain areas like the slums and port haven't changed and offer a sense of nostalgia and familiarity, as do the reappearance of Jak's old friends, including Samos the Sage, Keira, Ashelin, Torn, Sig, and so on. However, other areas of Haven City have changed greatly. The park is now the new nest headquarters for the Metal Heads and appears appropriately gloomy and dark, with pools of green acid and endless Metal Heads roaming around. Other areas of the city that experience constant battling have Metal Heads, KG Deathbots, and Freedom League soldiers fighting each other, making the city very dangerous to travel through without a zoomer to get away from the endless wave of enemies. To help deal with the many enemies Jak and Daxter will face, he once again has access to the morph gun from the previous game with the same Scattergun, Blaster, Vulcan Fury, and Peace Maker mods making a return. Also, each of the four mods has 2 new upgradeable firing modes. For example, the second upgrade for the Blaster shoots out a saucer shaped pod that spins around and fires a hail of Blaster shots at all enemies underneath it. Then there's the first upgrade of the Vulcan Fury that fires a beam of electricity. With these additional upgrades, the number of weapons for Jak has increased from 4 to 12. Jak also has use of his jetboard and the power of his Dark Jak form. He even gains a Light Jak form after being energized with Light Eco; in this form Jak can do things like surround himself with a force field, heal himself, or sprout a pair of wings that allow him to glide over longer distances. In certain missions Jak acquires several pieces of Precursor Armor that increase his overall health, so no longer will he be killed by enemies after just four hits.Aside from Jak's new weapons and powers, the game also offers a few new twists to the gameplay with certain specialized missions alongside the more traditional missions so popular with the previous game. One of these new missions has Daxter go into cyberspace, where he deals with deadly cybersecurity measures in a digital world similar to Pac-Man and the player controls a "Pac-Daxter". There's also a mission where Jak gets to control one of those spider-like Bomb Bots and use its laser to blast its way through Deathbots and blow up a shield wall. The game offers even more opportunities to play as Daxter by himself than the previous game did. There's also an increased number of challenging boss battles for Jak and Daxter to tackle; the last one is particularly awesome and quite incredible just to look at. So yes, Jak 3 is just as fun and hugely challenging as Jak II. The graphics are also top notch once again. The old and new environments all look great. I only had two small problems with this game. First, while it's still a free-roaming sandbox game, the missions are considerably more linear than they were in Jak II. While Jak II would usually offer between two to four missions simultaneously and let you choose which one you wanted to tackle first, this game takes away most of this freedom and normally only offers one or two different missions at a time. The second problem is that this game is noticeably shorter than Jak II; this problem appears to be tied to the increased linearity. Still, these minor problems don't detract enough from the game to lower the score I gave it. Jak 3 has all the magic of Jak II with challenging and varied missions, a great story, beautiful graphics, and of course the kind of humor that only Daxter could provide. It's all good with Jak and Daxter in the neighborhood.
Jak and Daxter are back in the conclusion of the Precursor Legacy Trilogy. This game is almost an exact clone of its predecessor in pretty much every aspect. Normally when a videogame sequel is this similar to the previous game, the sequel tends to lose its "freshness". Fortunately, that's not the case for Jak 3, it uses the same gameplay and graphics that made Jak II great, while also adding a few improvements here and there. The story begins with a rather surprising scene: Jak is banished from Haven City and is being left in the middle of the wasteland desert by a council member named Count Veger and his soldiers, despite objections from Jak's friends Daxter, Ashelin, and Pecker. Apparently, the city is holding Jak responsible for the Metal Heads invading the city at the end of the previous game, and even though Baron Praxis and Metal Kor were defeated, the city is still at war with the surviving Metal Heads and previous Krimzon Guard robots, known as KG Deathbots. Jak, accompanied by Daxter and Pecker, is later found by a group of wastelanders and taken to their city, Spargus, where Jak has to prove his worth to the wasteland king Damas by taking part in arena battles in order to be allowed to stay in the city.Jak and Daxter eventually make their way back to Haven City, which is a war zone with Metal Heads and KG Deathbots constantly attacking the previous members of the Underground and Krimzon Guard who now defend the city as the Freedom League. Between dealing with these enemies, proving Jak's innocence, and finding out what the obviously corrupt Count Veger is up to, Jak and Daxter have a lot on their plate. Lucky for them, they've got mad skills and even madder weapons and gadgets that they can use to deal with any challenge. In the wasteland, Jak and Daxter will do missions for the tough but fair Damas, where they'll deal with Marauders and new kinds of Metal Heads as they explore temples, volcanoes, and Metal Head nests. The wasteland is also twice as large as Haven City, and the duo can get around by riding one of several dune buggies of different sizes armed with machine guns, grenade launchers, and so on. One of them can jump 30 feet in the air, allowing Jak and Daxter to reach areas that regular buggies can't reach. Spargus itself is considerably smaller than Haven City and strongly resembles Tatooine from Star Wars. Due to its smaller size, Spargus is easier to go through on foot, however there are plenty of Leaper Lizards that Jak can ride to get to places (they control and move like the Flut Flut from the first game). While it's easier to get around Spargus, it's still possible to accidentally ram into its inhabitants, but since they're all armed warriors, you should be prepared for a firefight if you anger any of them.Haven City is quite different from the way it was in Jak II. Certain areas like the slums and port haven't changed and offer a sense of nostalgia and familiarity, as do the reappearance of Jak's old friends, including Samos the Sage, Keira, Ashelin, Torn, Sig, and so on. However, other areas of Haven City have changed greatly. The park is now the new nest headquarters for the Metal Heads and appears appropriately gloomy and dark, with pools of green acid and endless Metal Heads roaming around. Other areas of the city that experience constant battling have Metal Heads, KG Deathbots, and Freedom League soldiers fighting each other, making the city very dangerous to travel through without a zoomer to get away from the endless wave of enemies. To help deal with the many enemies Jak and Daxter will face, he once again has access to the morph gun from the previous game with the same Scattergun, Blaster, Vulcan Fury, and Peace Maker mods making a return.

Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy was a pure platformer at heart. It was more kid-friendly and goofy. Naughty Dog decided that they didn't want Jak and Daxter ending up like their previous Crash Bandicoot so they changed things up a 'bit' with Jak II. Jak II was darker, but not as dark as other games out there. It had the perfect tone of darkness for it to be a sequel to such a kiddy game. Jak II also had almost nothing to do with the first game. But enough of that, out with the old and in with the new. Enter Jak 3:It's been a while since Jak defeated Metal Kor and saved the city...or did he? Now with Ashelin temporarily ruling Haven City the Krimzon Guards don't exist anymore. Instead now they're the Freedom League Guards. Now the Metal Heads have returned somehow recuperating quickly after losing their leader. This has made Ashelin get off the throne thus Torn not being the Freedom League commander so a member of Haven City's Grand Council called Count Veger takes control of the Freedom League. Also, the Krimzon Guards mysteriously return with a new leader. The battle of the three factions continues as they all struggle for control of Haven City. And who do they blame for this problem? Jak of course. Count Veger blames Jak to save his own tail since he's the real problem because he wants control over the city. Soon the entire city believes Jak is responsable because of his 'friendship' with Krew. The Council decides to banish Jak to the Wasteland for life. Of course Daxter decides to join him and for some reason so does Pecker. After Jak and company can't take the sand and heat anymore, they're found by King Damus; the ruler of Spargus. Spargus is a small city in the big Wasteland where other exiled people roam. But it's not all easy for Jak when he's taken to Spargus. There they value survival over all other things and Jak has to prove himself to King Damus and his right-hand-man Kleever. After a while, he'll find ways to eventually get back into parts of Haven City although it's nothing like before. When Jak makes his way into Haven City he finds out that the city is now a destroyed battlefield. But that's not even half of the problem. This Precursor monk called Seem keeps talking about this mysterious Daystar and that the world's final trial is coming. She also tells Jak that his dark powers will eventually consume him so a Precursor(or is it an Oracle?)grants him light powers. So now Jak will have both Light Jak and Dark Jak. I gave this game five stars because it's the ending of the epic trilogy and Jak II was a real good game but don't judge the game yet since it's coming out on November. (...)

Poor, poor Alice. Your parents killed in a fire, you are now trapped in an insane asylum with only your madness to keep you company. Even your dreams of Wonderland have become corrupted by a fractured mind, old friends becoming terrifying menaces and familiar places now dank and mysterious. What was once a place of wonder now becomes a life-threatening journey into your own psychosis.Clever, wicked Alice, filled with malice, to bring all your new toys into Wonderland with you. From the simple knife (for hacking or throwing) to a lethal deck of cards to an explosive Jack-in-the-Box to the devastating Blunderbuss, the array of toys with which you defend yourself is simply delightful, in a dangerous sort of way. Your foes are many, and of a wide variety, including the brutish Card Guards, malevolent chess pieces, frightful Imps, a giant Mad Hatter, the twisted Jabberwock, and even the Red Queen herself. It's a good thing that you came to this new Wonderland prepared for some deadly play. There is much of it to be had.But, dear Alice, don't you know that all your old friends are here as well? There's the old Rabbit, of course, as obsessed as ever with his pocket watch and his tardiness. And the Caterpillar, who seems to have descended further into his own addictions. And even the dear Cheshire Cat is here, accompanying you on your journey always ready to offer his toothsome grin and a word of wry advice. Your friends may be a little more twisted, a little more frightening than before, but they're all still here. At first, anyway.This isn't the Wonderland you once knew, Alice. It has become beautiful and terrible in your absence. Once-peaceful landscapes are now frightening and treacherous, slightly maddening in their off-kilter perspective. Voices, once comforting and friendly, are now laced with a tone of threat and malice. Music, once sprightly, is strange and otherwordly. You must be constantly aware of your surroundings, as you can be suddenly attacked from almost anywhere.This is a fight for your sanity, Alice.  For your very life.  Be careful, be strong, be brave... and you may just escape this strange new Wonderland with your mind intact.

This will definitely not be the deepest game you will ever play. However, if you are a huge Simpsons fan, this game is definitely worth the investment. It is basically a shameful [copy] of Crazy Taxi with Simpsons characters. You drive around town as one of 18 playable characters, pick up passengers, follow the arrow to their destination and drop them off before the time expires to earn money. If the trip timer reaches zero, the passengers becomes impatient and jumps out of the car. If your overall time runs out then the game is over.The best thing about Simpsons Road Rage is that it is true to the show. The environments look exactly like they do on TV. You will see the Simpsons' home, the school, the Kwik-E-Mart, the church and the Retirement Castle just to name a few recognizable locations. The characters' voices also sound authentic as they quote familiar lines from the show. There are 18 playable characters (actually 16 since there are two versions of Homer and two of Moe) including the entire Simpsons family, Ned Flanders, Professor Frink, Otto, Groundskeeper Willie, Snake, Apu, Chief Wiggum and Krusty the Klown. They all have their own vehicles to fit their personalities and/or occupations. There are also several other unplayable characters who appear as passengers, like Milhouse, Ralph Wiggum, Hans Moleman and Principal Skinner. Then there are the six huge environments. You can cruise through the Evergreen Terrace neighborhood, the Entertainment District, Springfield Dam, the Nuclear Power Plant, Downtown or the Springfield Mountains.There are four driving modes to play around with. The meat of the game is in Road Rage mode, which is the taxi mode I explained before. You must play this over and over and over in order to earn money to unlock characters and neighborhoods. Every time you play, your money gets added to a cumulative total. Every time that total reaches a predetermined amount (10,000, 30,000, 50,000, 75,000 and so on), you can choose whether to unlock another character or another neighborhood.The other game modes include Sunday Drive, where you can drive around any of the unlocked neighborhoods and get to know the terrain and find shortcuts. There is also a Mission Mode, which includes ten missions, usually involving knocking over a certain number of street signs, light posts, mascots, etc., that you may or may not want to bother playing through, especially since the game takes a long time to reload itself every time you restart or fail the mission. Finally, there is a two player multiplayer mode where the two players are in a race to pick up each passenger. Once the passenger is picked up, the other player can steal the passenger by bumping into the car with the passenger in it. Whoever ends up dropping off the passenger gets the money and the first person to earn a set amount of money wins the game.Of course there will always be some negatives to every game, and this one is no exception. First, the loading times are almost unbearable. There is no such thing as a quick restart. Second, the game can get repetitive very quickly. It starts to feel like a chore playing game after game after game trying to add more money to your pot so you can unlock the other characters. The change in environment can help some, but some of the neighborhoods have huge learning curves. It could take a lot of exploring before you get used to some of the environments. And when you are trying to add money to your pot, it is hard to waste a game earning only 2,000 in Springfield Dam when you know you could earn around 9,000 a game in Evergreen Terrace. Third, I cannot decide whether the dialogue in the game is annoying or entertaining. Each passenger has a number of lines that they might say when they jump in your car, and your character has a number of lines that they will say as a reply. However, more often than not, the two lines do not match up at all and it sounds like a pretty random conversation.Negatives aside, this is a pretty simple game that you can always go back to when you have nothing better to do. It is not likely to keep you occupied for hours at a time, but for any Simpsons fan, this is a pretty entertaining game.

I am a big Simpson's fan, even though I don't get FOX, and for what it's worth, The Simpson's Road Rage delivers all of the zany characters and Springfield landmarks into one big time-challenging wise-cracking speed and money making extravaganza that beats Crazy Taxi any day!One of the greatest things of this game is that you don't have to enjoy the Simpsons to have a heck of a good time with this title, because the funny lines and fast-paced action of it all will leave you hypnotized. But for you Simpson Fanatics out there, this is one title you have to get.First off, the whole point of the game is to buy back Springfield's transit system from Mr. Burns, as his nuclear powered buses are, "a threat to the public health." You do this by picking up passengers and getting them to there destinations as fast as possibe-the faster you are, the more time and money you make.Over 30 halarious characters from the show appear, including rare ones, such as the baseball mascot and moleman, plus you get to drive as 18 of them. Each one has their own cool automoble, truck, soap box racer or flying car and when on the road say thier own endless amount of unique things to thier costumers.The Simpson characters that you pick up also make insults about your driving, and make you laugh when they jump out of your car if not dropped off fast enough!There are plenty of modes including Sunday Drive where you get a feel for Springfield with no time limit, Missions Mode, where you piliot specific characters to fufill their own goals and get you a secret unlockable, and Head-to-Head where you and a friend compete to deliver one person to a destination.And as you trudge twoards your goal of making One Million Dollars, other unlockables include 6 worlds, (Nuclear Power Plant, Entertainment District etc..) with very familiar things from the episodes like Krusty Burgers and Mr. Burns Mansion, with everything completley destructabe like bilboards and trees, with many shortcuts and jumps. Also you can unlock other characters to drive as. What is really cool is that you decide which unlockable you want to get, and you can drive over everything in sight!The game engine has also been created to make everything look like a Simpson episode, from it's thickly outlined buildings to it's scenery and characters. They also had the real Simpson voice cast come in and have the actual character's voices included in the game!To wrap things up nice and easily, The Simpson's Road Rage is challenging and halarious, with several modes, great characters and the desire to make a whole lot of money!This is a must-have for any gamer, no matter how familiar the Simpsons seem to you!Don't have a cow man, and just get this title!

Hi-Diddly-Ho There! Ned Flanders at your ser-viddly-ervice!!!The Game starts out with the Simpsons watching the news and they find out That Homer's boss, C. Montgomery Burns has bought the bus company and has made the buses radioactive. The citizens of Springfield won't stand for it. They are forced to turn their cars into cabs and boycott the buses, while collecting money to buy back the bus comnpany.This is one awesome game. If you're a big Simpsons fan, like me, you'll love this game. One strange thing about this game is that its just like Crazy Taxi in every way, except there is a primary objective that must be completed to beat the game, (collect a million dollars to buy back the bus company.) You can play with about eighteen characters and play on six levels. As far as game play goes, it is awesome. Graphics are phenominal and another cool thing is that the characters sound and look just as they do on the show.

Hi-Diddly-Ho There! Ned Flanders at your ser-viddly-ervice!!!The Game starts out with the Simpsons watching the news and they find out That Homer's boss, C. Montgomery Burns has bought the bus company and has made the buses radioactive. The citizens of Springfield won't stand for it. They are forced to turn their cars into cabs and boycott the buses, while collecting money to buy back the bus comnpany.This is one awesome game. If you're a big Simpsons fan, like me, you'll love this game. One strange thing about this game is that its just like Crazy Taxi in every way, except there is a primary objective that must be completed to beat the game, (collect a million dollars to buy back the bus company.) You can play with about eighteen characters and play on six levels. As far as game play goes, it is awesome. Graphics are phenominal and another cool thing is that the characters sound and look just as they do on the show. Here are the characters you can play with (their cars and best asset are also listed)Homer: Family Sedan  (All around)Marge: Convero  (All Turning)Bart: Soap Box Racer  (Acceleration)Lisa: Electric Car  (Acceleration)Grandpa: Go-Cart  (Speed)Professor Frink: Hover Car  (Best overall) (My Favorite!)Flanders: Station wagon  (All Around)Krusty the Clown: Clown Car  (Turning)Apu: Sports car  (Speed)Homer: Mr. Plow  (All Around)Snake:Lil' Bandit  (All Speed)Chief Wiggum: Cop Car  (Turning)Barney: Plow King  (All Power)Otto: School Bus  (Power)Moe: Sedan  (Turning)Groundskeeper Willie: Tractor  (Speed)Reverend Lovejoy: Book-Burning Mobile (Power)And Six Real Simpsons Boards:Evergreen Terrace  (Where The Simpsons live)Entertainment District(Where Moe's Tavern is)Springfield DamNuclear Power Plant  (Where Homer Works)DowntownSpring Field MontainsThere is only one flaw to this entire game, not all the characters in the Simpsons Show are involved in the game. other than that its perfect.

After being bored to tears with WWE 12 and WWE 13, I always like to rewind time and play THQ's better offerings. Here's my review-Graphics-The one thing I wasn't too crazy about in this game was the graphics. They're not bad by any means, in fact, the wrestlers move fast and fluid with lots of animation. However, during the entrances is the ugliest part of the game. I realize this game came out in 2001, but wow, the entrances didn't show a &#34;next gen leap&#34; at all. Square heads, flat faces, boxy hands and such rear it's ugly head.That's about as bad as the game looks (cutscenes and entrances), however, once you get into the ring, the game is beautiful. The animation is really good. I particularly was fond of when you pulled off a reversal only to suplex or clothesline an opponent who'd sell a move really good. All of the moves have impact which is missing from the new WWE games. A suplex looks like it really hurts, clotheslines or bodyslams look equally painful. Basically, any move in the game looks fantastic and the wrestlers actually look good in the ring with no slowdown.Sound-There's something I actually like about the annoying commentary found in this game. Michael Cole and Tazz's commentary are really brutal. I wonder why being that past games ike WWF warzone or WWF attitude actually had stellar commentary.The commentary sounds like every phrase is telegraphed in the sense of &#34;Perry...Saturn...is (insert)&#34;. It doesn't sound natural at all.The music is appropriate and I liked some of the theme songs like Dean Malenko's James Bond inspired song.The slams and such sound nice. There's no grunts that I hear and the weapons had dull thuds.Gameplay-First off, the one thing I hate about the control is that it doesn't support analog control. To some this is minor, but I feel a wrestling game should always support analog control.Anyway, the control is about the same as the previous smackdown being that square is reverse, triangle is run, X is to punch or kick and O is to grapple. The other buttons aren't really needed until you find yourself in a match featuring more than 2 wrestlers.I really like how smooth the control scheme is in this game and wish they still used this for modern games. The control is super responsive.The game's roster is the only gripe I had. It features- Perry Saturn, Eddie Guerrero, Dean Malenko, Test, Albert, Dudley Boys, Edge, Kurt Angle, Chris Jericho, Chris Benoit, Triple H, Undertaker, Kane, Big Show, Raven, The Rock, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Rikishi and such.I'm surprised this game didn't feature a better roster being that there were a good amount of wrestlers around then and this was around the invasion angle's beginning. (SDSYM has a better roster)The CAW mode really stinks to be honest. I couldn't even pick a wrestler's theme song and the options are limited.I really don't have much to say bad about the game, but it is a good game featuring a decent roster of wrestlers and some cool perks. Some things worth noting would be that it has an excellent TLC match, you can fight in the crowd...but I felt the wrestlers got up too fast. Even after hitting them with a finisher, they'd get back up.

This game is sooooooooo fun! You need to colect one million$ by delivering passengers to their locations.The money is to buy back Burns' flet of radioactive buses. It has 6 large neiborhoods, and there are at least 20 places in each level. The drivers are so funny. People say it is repetive. That is only if you use the same driver on the same level ever time. Chief Wiggum says "dont sit on my gun!" and "i'd tell you to buckle up, but someone stole the seat belts" There are tons of lines from every character and cool cars. I dont know if there are cheats or not, but after you beat all the missions, you get a special car made for Homer. There are seasonal characters, like new years Krusty and thanksgiving Marge. The game can be beaten in about a week, but is still loads of fun. The first 4 missions are so easy it is almost a joke. Missions # 8 and 10 are the only hard ones. The graphics are amazing, and the voices sound authentic. The whole game has that "cartoonie" look to it. You can make a lot more money on hard than easy. Unless you really, really hate the simpsons, get this game. I had never watched the simpsons before, and i loved this game. This game has some mild profanity, like "I'm Bart Simpson, who the hell are you? " and "damn straight!". Grandpa says "where are you taking me, to hell?!" This just adds to the fun of the game. There are some shortcuts, and passageways to help you get there faster. The faster you get there, the bigger the tip. If there is at least 35% of the trip timer left when you arrive, you get a *fast* rating, 20-35% of the timer will get you a *average* rating, and less than 20% will give a *slow* rating. At the end of each Road Rage, you get a rating on how much money you earned the ratings go like thisLoser:$0Grandma:$1 to $999Timid: $1000 to $2999Destructive: $3000 to $4999(if you get less than $5000 you need a lot of practice)Reckless:$5000 to $6999Insane: $7000 to $9999Speed Freak:$10,000 to 12,499Gazelle:$12,500 to $14,999Madman:$15,000+There are also Road Rage trips, this is where a passenger tells you to run over so many things before you get them to their destination. If you succeed, you get a $1000 bonus plus the tip and earnings. Safe Trips is where a passenger tells you to not hit any more than 2 cars before you get them to their destination. You get a $250 bonus on these. Knocking over bus stops gives you an extra 2 seconds on your overall timer. there is also Head to Head.this is when 2 players face off in  one of the 4 districts. there is one passenger out at a time and the 2 players race to pick up the person. If player 1 has the passenger, player 2 can bump into the opponent to "steal" the passenger. the first player to get the person to the destination gets a $1000 fare. the first person to get 5, 10, or 15,000$ wins. its the most fun i ever had i would get the game for just this. No matter what system you own, this is a must-buy.

Since I was about 9 years old, I always wanted to pilot a Veritech and finally, with Robotech: Battlecry I got my wish--sort of.  The greatest thing, to me anyway, is that you can change modes on the fly, which gives it about as much realism as you can expect without being in the cockpit.  I love to come screaming in on some Battlepods in Fighter mode than snap to Battloid mode and land in their midst to blow the heck out of them with my gatling gun.  The versatility of being able to choose which mode I want to play in makes it a lot more fun than if you were stuck to one mode per mission, as I suspect would have been the case in the 8-bit days.The biggest disappointment is of course that you aren't Rick Hunter, so you don't get to do all the cool stuff like battle in Saturn's rings or on Mars--Earth's orbit is the farthest you get until the very end.  The story itself is pretty neat and I couldn't believe how it ended, which didn't leave the possibility for a sequel.  I almost--ALMOST--cried at that point for my poor guy who had been through so much.Well anyway, some of the missions are a lot of fun, like the colossal dogfight where you have to save Rick Hunter's bacon, and others are the annoying protect missions like where you have to defend the townspeople of Gravestone and the one where you have to escort the Cat's Eye and somehow defend it while it flies straight and level through a gauntlet of enemy fire.  When I first bought the game, a few of those missions prompted quite a bit of screaming and swearing--much more than a grown man should do at a video game--but ultimately I got lucky and beat them.  There are plenty more of the fun missions than irritating ones.The best mission to me was the one where I finally got to pay Hiro back for bossing me around all the time by disabling his Destroid.  That's also one of the easier missions, but it's just so sweet to knock out one of those whiny, helpless, useless Destroids.As for repeat game play, there's not much to it after you get all the awards and mechs, but sometimes (like right now) I like to go back and start over again to beat it all over again.  Only of course this time I have the invincibility cheat so no Zentraedi can touch my VT.  It's also fun after you have all the mechs to go back and try missions again with an S, R, or Armored Veritech.There's not much more I could have asked for from this game.  It was well worth the money I paid not just for it, but for the PS2 I bought pretty much for the expressed reason of playing this game.  I wish and wish TDK would come out with sequels for the Hovertanks and especially the Cyclones, but I'm not sure it'll happen.  Even better would be a game where you could do all three.  How much fun would it be to blast Invid with a Veritech?  Or Battlepods with a Hovertank?  The sky's the limit.

Boom Blocks starts with a fairly basic premise; there are these blocks, and they're stacked on top of each other. With me so far? Now, knock them over!OK, it gets more complicated than that, but that does sum up a good chunk of it.There are exploding blocks, blocks that blow up when they touch each other, blocks that disappear when they get hit, blocks worth different values, all kinds of blocks! And you throw things at them! Baseballs, tennis balls, super balls, bombs, lots of stuff! Or you pull them out. Every move is dependent on the Wii's motion controls.And it works! They made this simple premise really work! It's fun if you're a gamer, it's fun if you're not a gamer, it's just a lot of fun! You can even build your own levels, or add exclamation mark after exclamation mark to your review of the game!Yes, over excited, but it really is a great game. One shortcoming though. It's ironic since Spielberg was attached, but there are a couple story lines, and it all seems very tacked on. I mean, the game is a lot of fun without adding anthropomorphic block-animal characters. It's just really hard to buy any sort of story-line that suggests that throwing baseballs at piles of blocks is an intrinsic part to said story line. Still, demon-monkey-blocks kind of make it worth getting through story mode.
A lot of times, when I get a new system, I will go on for a while picking up different games and playing through them and figuring out what I think about them, but many of them I will often wind up trading toward other games as I go along.  However, later on, I will often go back and recollect the ones I most enjoyed.  I just recently recollected this one for my Ps2 collection, having been one of my favorites on Ps2.  I have recollected a good chunk of others on Ps2 at this point as well, spare a few.  The only problem with this game is that sometimes it can tend to be a bit glitchy, but overall this was an awesome game!  If you have Ps2 or Xbox access, I recommend checking this game out if you have never played it...if you like adventure & shooters.  It was pretty cool, and the storyline is kind of a 'what if?' type of scenario...if America had been invaded by another country.  It's really a lot of fun, and if you want to have a little more fun with it too, there are some fun cheat codes for it.  Overall, very fun!

This game is pretty fun, I had HSG3 and FORE for the PS2 and I had a good amount of fun playing those game. I also purchased the HS Open Tee 1&2 for the PSP system and those games were really fun as well. I think this game is pretty good, but I don't think it's better than any of it's predecesors.Actually the game is like the other one's to me, I just consider it a new installment of the series.Don't get me wrong, I love this game b/c it's fun and it's not hard to get the hang of. I think they're all linear games but it's cool. One thing I don't like is that you cannot change out tops and pants for the characters. One other thing I'd like to see would maybe that an African-American character or two since we play golf also.No hard feelings, the game is great, I'd recommend it to anyone that likes golf or just wants to have fun!
First of all, this expansion pack is great, it adds a lot of nice features, the obdivious ones like starting businesses and all the robots. Though they are pretty easy to make piles of money with little effort anyone who plays the sims knows you can make it harder by doing things like trying to run the business with you as the only employee and such. But running a business in any sensiable way makes it just incredably easy to make piles of money. Despite that it's still pretty fun, since you can do all sorts of businesses.Also, there are a lot of bugs, they do get pretty annoying but sooner or later they will make a patch fixing all these bugs. If you can't deal with bugs just wait for the patch and everything will be fine.
fun with or without friends, my parents actually play it some with me consider it like a wii play type of game only it supports 4 players has a single player campaign, the very hard levels are VERY HARD, and can be a lot of fun.HOWEVER maybe it's just me but my wii remotes jump around in this game (i bought it new) just like my counsel. this makes the hard levels VERY HARD, and the VERY HARD levels impossible.
I own all of the C&C games so I feel pretty much comfortable in making a comment on these. I haven't played Tiberium Wars a lot yet since I haven't had it that long but, the times I have, I have found it to be another top of the line game in the C&C series. I like the idea of using live players for the film strips and EA got some good ones this time around. The addition of new machinery, weapons, etc., really enhances game play and this game is just plain habit forming and fun. It isn't hard to learn how to play and, it isn't so hard that it is impossible to win once you do. Definately it is not among that category of game you find so hard to beat you give up on it after a short time and never play it again. It can be modded and there are trainers and a few cheat codes I think, for people who use these,(I do,) which is also an enhancement. The one thing not included, which could have been a big plus, is an easy to use campaign and/or map editor. Playing the same skirmish maps over and over gets old after a time and a good editor can only add to the playing time and interest of a game such as this.
This review is done having only completed half or so of the campaign and i have yet to try mp due to psn being down. I will update when finished. First off graphics are indeed exceptional, even though to me its not a real big deal. The game does start off a little bit slow. Cloak mode makes early part of game a bit too easy in that you can just walk by enemies without being noticed.However, once you get going game really picks up. I would recommend this game it is really different. Below is a summary.Negatives: some glitchesotoo easy early oncannot pass thru cutscenes, this will diminish replayability to me, even though i willreplay thisa couple of spots where not sure where to go i hate this in video gamesPositives: great graphicsinteresting game play and options for a fpsdepth and lengthdifferent ways to approach enemiesreally fun, better than kz2 much better than all cod, way better than mgs4story is solid but a bit hard to followcloaking can be good but its too easy at firstAddition just added: finished game and have started multiplayer.Game gets better as you go on.You cannot just rely on stealth you do actually hacw to fight latter on in game and this is good. I do really like that sometimes stealth other times fighting is way to go. this is a really good game, i wished first few missions didn't drag so much however. Multiplayer looks good but similar to others. Nothing really new, i wished there was more teamwork to fight bosses or something as a group and not just a frag fest as all fps seem to be.

The first two Lord of the Rings titles belonged to that rare group of worthy film-based games. How many movie tie-in games have been less-than-stellar garbage capitalizing on a film's popularity? With "The Return of the King," EA concludes their trilogy with one of the best games of the year. A warning to those who have not read the books and do not know how the trilogy ends: As expected, the game contains many spoilers.The biggest difference between ROTK and its predecessors may be the amount of action: Fellowship was mostly plot-oriented, and Two Towers featured one great action piece--Helm's Deep. ROTK, however, thrives on action. From start to finish,  this game is non-stop action and adventure: gargantuan Siege Towers,  monstrous trolls, bloodthirsty Uruk-Hai--this game gives you all you can handle, and then some. You'll be thankful for the occasional pauses to rest your thumbs--before the next attack begins. The game features voice-work from the film's actors and some of the most amazing backgrounds and environments I've ever seen in a video game, with perfect contrast between light and dark elements  Like the films, there's meticulous attention to detail. Character design and appearance is first-rate, and character animation (thanks to motion-capture technology) is smooth and even. In addition, the sound quality (THX, no less) is outstanding--every roar, every clash of steel resounds through your speakers.ROTK features three distinct playable storylines: The Path of the King, The Path of the Hobbits, and The Path of the Wizard. One can play as Aragorn, Legolas, Gandalf, Gimli, Frodo, or Sam, and beating the game unlocks three new characters.  Follow Aragorn on the Paths of the Dead and recruit the undead to fight alongside you, from Minas Tirith to the Black Gate (and you'll get to battle the Mouth Of  Sauron in an epic conflict).  Follow Frodo and Sam from Osgiliath to Shelob's Lair to Mount Doom. Take the wizard's path, and have Gandalf fight from Orthanc to Minas Tirith. There are thirteen levels, and the three storylines converge in a final level only accessible when all thirteen are finished. Some levels are relatively easy (Shelob's Lair wasn't too tough) and some are barbaric in their difficulty (Paths of the Dead took me six tries before I beat it). Each character has their own unique style and weapons, with plenty of enemies to battle: Shelob, Orcs, Mumakils (Oliphaunts), Uruk-Hai, The King of the Dead, and more. Attacks are pretty straightforward: Quick attack, Fierce attack, parry, or fire (arrows and the like). As you gain experience points from defeating enemies, you can acquire better weapons and skills (such as invisibility and the truly awesome Balrog's Revenge) to combat the increasingly difficult foes one faces as the game progresses.  And, one can choose to retain those points for oneself, or share them with other characters.The game has three difficulty settings: Easy, normal, and hard. Easy is just that: easy. Normal is moderately challenging, but beatable for most average gamers. Select hard, and you're asking for it. The enemies seem to never end, and even the lowliest orcs take incredible amounts of punishment before falling. Hard difficulty may be best tackled with the game's Co-Op mode, which allows a friend to participate. A major problem with the game, however, is that you can't replay a level until you've beaten it. But once you complete it, every level opens up and can be played by any character--which gives the game better long-term replayability than most movie titles (and many non-movie ones, as well). PS2 gamers will have to contend with occasionally slow framerates due to the PS2's low-end processor. This usually only occurs when a horde of enemies are present, but it's still a little annoying. Another thing I didn't like was the occasional difficulty caused by the game's third-person perspective. Like most TP games, certain positions or angles create blind spots. In close combat, this can prove to be a major aggravation. But those are relatively minor things that detract little from the overall quality of this game. For anyone looking for an excellent action/adventure game, this can't be beat. Highly recommended.
The first two Lord of the Rings titles belonged to that rare group of worthy film-based games. How many movie tie-in games have been less-than-stellar garbage capitalizing on a film's popularity? With "The Return of the King," EA concludes their trilogy with one of the best games of the year. A warning to those who have not read the books and do not know how the trilogy ends: As expected, the game contains many spoilers.The biggest difference between ROTK and its predecessors may be the amount of action: Fellowship was mostly plot-oriented, and Two Towers featured one great action piece--Helm's Deep. ROTK, however, thrives on action. From start to finish,  this game is non-stop action and adventure: gargantuan Siege Towers,  monstrous trolls, bloodthirsty Uruk-Hai--this game gives you all you can handle, and then some. You'll be thankful for the occasional pauses to rest your thumbs--before the next attack begins. The game features voice-work from the film's actors and some of the most amazing backgrounds and environments I've ever seen in a video game, with perfect contrast between light and dark elements  Like the films, there's meticulous attention to detail. Character design and appearance is first-rate, and character animation (thanks to motion-capture technology) is smooth and even. In addition, the sound quality (THX, no less) is outstanding--every roar, every clash of steel resounds through your speakers.ROTK features three distinct playable storylines: The Path of the King, The Path of the Hobbits, and The Path of the Wizard. One can play as Aragorn, Legolas, Gandalf, Gimli, Frodo, or Sam, and beating the game unlocks three new characters.  Follow Aragorn on the Paths of the Dead and recruit the undead to fight alongside you, from Minas Tirith to the Black Gate (and you'll get to battle the Mouth Of  Sauron in an epic conflict).

As a huge fan of the LOTR movies, I was itching to get my hands around a controler and tackle the Return of the King game.  A lot of questions were swirling around my head as I started playing.  Would I have fun?  Would it be too hard?  I am pleased to say that the Return of the King is a fantastic movie liscened game and a great game by itself.The Return of the King uses a new graphics engine, which is apparent from the moment you start fighting orcs.  Everything is more detailed and better then the Two Towers game, and some of the levels are absoloutly astonishing in terms of how big everything is (A prime example is the battle of the Pelennor fields level).  Speaking of the Two Towers, it's a good idea to be familiar with how that game is because the Return of the king game assumes you have memorized all the combat because it dumps you right into the action with little explenation as how to fight.The Return of the King has three paths for you to take.  After finishing the opening level, you can take the path of the wizard to Minas Tirith, The path of the King to the Paths of the Dead, and the path of the hobbits to Mordor.  You can tackle any level in any order, and all of them lead up to a explosive finalie at the Crack of Doom.  Along that route, you'll be fighting thousands of bad guys.  At times there are so many bad guys on screen I was amazed that there was no slowdown on my PS2.  The Black Gate level (Which is AWESOME) is a prime example of this, but I'll let you see that for yourself.The Return of the king has three times as many playable charachters as the first game for a total of nine charachters (including three secret charachters).  Each charachter has thier own fighting style (Except for the hobbits) to play with.  Gandalf the White is a very balanced charachter as is Aragorn, while Legolas is fast but weak, and Gimli is slow but very strong.  One of the best features about the game is that once you finish the Crack of Doom level, you can go back and play any level with any charachter, which leads to some very funny what if scenarios, such as what if Aragorn took on Shelob the Spider, or if Sam defended the Walls of Minas Tirith etc.Sadly, Return of the King has some areas where I was a little dissapointed in.  All the ads for the game say you fight Shelob, the King of the Dead, Saurons Lutinent, the witch King and more.  There is a little bit of false advertising in that statement.  The Witch King is in the game, but all you ever do is shoot arrows at his fell beast until it dies, then you watch a cutscene of Eowyn and Merry fighting the Witch King.  I was INCREDIBLY dissapointed that you cannot fight him hand to hand, as that would have been awesome.  Also I had read that Sauron was going to be a boss in several magazines, but that is not true.  I was also mystified why the final boss is immune to your attacks.  Secondly, at times there are no clues as to what you are supposed to do next.  On the Walls of Minas Tirith level, you use a catapault to destroy a siege tower, but for the next two, there are no catapaults, and it took me eight replays before I realized that I could destroy the towers with my ranged attack.  Likewise, on the Crack of Doom, it took me forever to figure out how to defeat the final boss (You have to knock him/her/it over the ledge, then use a finishing move).  Another little complaint is that on the Shelob's lair level, it starts out great because you can hear Frodo calling for help and fighting something big far away while you try to reach him, but the game ruins the suspense halfway through the level when it shows Shelob in all her glory (I think she isint big enought).  Also, why are orcs camping out in Shelobs tunnels?  It wouldent make any sense in the movie if Frodo was running from Shelob, only to encounter orcs having a campfire in the middle of this evil spider infested cave.  Another thing is that while you can replay any level with any charachter, the game does not modify the cutscenes with the other charachters.  In the cutscenes, the new charachter you play as is standing still, and dosent do a thing.  An example of this is in the Shelob battle, when Sam stabs Shelob in the eye.  If you are not playing as Sam, then Shelobs eye will suddenly pop on its own.  It would be great if it showed all the charachters doing the actions, but it dosent, and that is disapointing.Aside from those complaints, this game is awesome and a lot of fun to play.  I havent played the game on Two player mode, so I can't review that.  But if you are a fan of the movie, you will probably love this.  Highly recommended.The Good:Fantastic graphicseasy controlsgreat to play the movieGreat Replay featuresThe bad:You cannot fight the Witch kingShelob is not big enoughOrcs having campfires in Shelobs lair?!?Cutscenes not modified for additional charachtersBottom line:  A fantastic game, with a few disapointments.

Video games based on movies have always suffered, "The Curse".  The curse that plauges movie tie in games that makes them awful to anyone but the most devoted fans.  Seeing the pictures of this game early in development, if finially seemed that it would break that curse.  Did it?  Well, yes, but just barley.The Two towers starts off very well, using the prolouge footage from the first movie to tell the story of the ring.  When we get to the battle of Mount Doom, you take on the role of Isildiur fighting orcs, and trying to stay alive.  This scene does a good job of introducing the player to the concepts of gameplay, such as fierce attack, and the vital parry move.  After that, you play as Aragorn on Weathertop, wielding off the Ringwraiths and protecting Frodo.  Here, you must learn the Parry move, which will save you... many times over.  Then the game goes into full swing, and the action begins.The Gameplay for the Two Towers is pure hack-n-slash.  you go through a linear path, hacking up enimies, and...well...uh... hacking up more enimies!  After the level is over, you are given points that you can spend to purchuse new skills and combos, along with other things such as more health, and better bows and arrows.  The game does very well in this section.The graphics and sound are easily the high point of the game.  The visuals are top notch, and the charachters are very detailed.  They look exactly like thier movie counterparts (Except for Gimli during the FMV scenes).  They also sound like thier movie counterparts because they are voiced by the real actors.  Every actor (Except for Christopher Lee) did voice work for thier digital selves, and it adds a really big bounous that lends an air of authenticity to the game.  Another big bonous is the cool factor that comes in when re-playing the scenes from the movies, such as Balins tomb, Aragorn vs. Lurtz (Or, you can do Legolas vs. Lurtz, or Gimli vs. Lurtz, or Secret charachter vs. Lurtz) and of course, Helms deep.Unfortunitly, the two towers did not escape "The Curse" entirely.  My biggest gripe with the game is the very thing that makes it a brawler,The combos.  Combos are a string of moves strung togethor to kill enimies fast, and get more experience points.  For example, to do Isildiurs/Balins/Elronds swift terror, you would rapidly tap, X,X, triangle to do a damaging attack that would good damage.  However, as the game goes on, the game, in a sense, forces you to use combos to meerly survive.  When you reach Helms deep, you have to use every combo in your arsenal to move on, and frankly, its a pain...to memorize all these combos (On a side note, it is possible to finsih the game with a minimal amount of combos, its just very very hard).  Also, some of them dont work very well, if at all.  One attack has you strike your enemy, then charge forward to knock him down, and then finish him off.  3/4 of the time, I rush forward and stab my blades into the ground, while my intended victim slashes me to the ground.  If you get hit while you are in the midst of a combo, it ruins it and you have to start over.Some of the later levels are a pain ...to get through.  The last last level in the game is really hard, but conquerable.  The trick is to shoot ALL the archers before resuming fighitng.Other little niggies.  Where are the other hobbits?  Frodo is the only hobbit to appear in the game, so Sam, Merry, and Pippin are completly absent, aside from Merry and Pippin in a movie scene.  All the charachters seem to move a little too fast, and some voice work of Gandalf seems a bit...off.But I dont want to paint an excessivly poor picture of this game.  Its a blast to play, and a lot of fun.  The DVD style extras are very cool, such as the actors talking about the game (John-rhies-Davies (Gimli) is probobly the neatest one).  There is also a secret charachter to unlock (Who is pretty cool).  And the cheat codes are nice.  Probobly my favorite feature is (WARNING: GO NO FURTHER IF YOU WANT A FUNNY SUPRISE REVEALED) the mini enemy cheat code.  Whenever I feel sad or depressed, turning on this code shrinks all the eniemes to absoloutly tiny size, and brightens my day.  Its absoloutly hilarious to see goblins that are 12 inches tall, Uruk-Hi two feet tall, Wargs the size of Chiwalwas,trolls, who are absoloutly gut bustingly funny, and funniest of all, the ringwraiths!  And wait untill you see Lurtz boss battle! (END SPOILER).Overall, this game is great for Lord of the rings fans, but If you hate stringing togethor combos like I do, I recommend renting it first.The good:Superb graphics and soundfun gameplayneat levelscool extrasa certian hilarious cheat codeThe not so good:People who do not like stringing togethor combos will not like this game so muchsometimes a bit too hardcharachters move a little too fastLurtz appears to give you "The finger" in a cut scene

Its absoloutly hilarious to see goblins that are 12 inches tall, Uruk-Hi two feet tall, Wargs the size of Chiwalwas,trolls, who are absoloutly gut bustingly funny, and funniest of all, the ringwraiths!  And wait untill you see Lurtz boss battle! (END SPOILER).Overall, this game is great for Lord of the rings fans, but If you hate stringing togethor combos like I do, I recommend renting it first.The good:Superb graphics and soundfun gameplayneat levelscool extrasa certian hilarious cheat codeThe not so good:People who do not like stringing togethor combos will not like this game so muchsometimes a bit too hardcharachters move a little too fastLurtz appears to give you "The finger" in a cut scene
The release of Lord of the Rings: Return of the King for xbox was much anticipated by many avid gamers, myself inculded.  When I first purchased the game, I was amazed that there were three different paths that you could take in the game (unlike the Two Towers).  The three paths are: The Way of the King, the Way of the Wizard, and the Way of the Hobbit.  The first battle you are automatically thrown into, however.  This is the end of the battle of Helmsdeep!  You are playing as Gandalf the Gray and must thwart the orcs and save Helms deep!  After you have beaten this level, however, you are free to chose which path you want to take first.  The Path of the King is the hardest and starts off with Aragorn, Gimili, and Legolas going to the undead to enlist their help to fight the Orcs.  The Path of the Wizard is slightly shorter, but not easy.  Here you play only as Gandalf the White and are involved in everything from the destruction of Sauron's tower, to Minas Tirith where you have to run around and knock off the orcs and the bombard towers, to the Courtyard of Minas Tirith where you are charged with protecting the women and children from the orc onslaught.  Lastly, the Path of the Hobbit is hard, but fun.  You play as Sam, most of the time and have to go through everything the hobbits went through in the movie.Once you complete all three paths, you will be able to play the Black Gate level.  Here you can pick from any of these characters (Gimili, Aragorn, Gandalf, Sam, Legolas) and you will have to fight , along side your allies to defeat the armies of Sauron outside his own Gates.On Completion of this level, you will be able to partake in the final level of the Game (The Crack of Doom).  Here you will play as Frodo and have to fight Smeogol inorder to kill him and destroy the ring.  Smeogol is particuarly difficult mainly becuase he is so fast and his hits take down your health fast.  Once you have beaten this level..CONGRATULATIONS!!  Now you can use cheats.  There are two bonus levels (the Palantir of Sauroman) that you can fight to get all of your characters up to max. level 20.  Now you can use all the characters (Gimili, Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pipin, Legolas, Aragorn, Feramir, and Gandalf).As a last note...after the completion of any level, you will be able to buy upgrades for your character with exp. points!  And even better..you can go through the game with a friend!  Co-op missions allow you all the same level, except with a friend by your side!PROS:-  Excellent Graphics-  Co-op missions-  Tons of Levels to play-  After you complete the Crack of Doom, you can go back and replay any mission you want-  Great and useful upgradesCONS:-  On Co-op its not split-screen, you and your friend are on the same screen (which I like but some might not)Hope this helps!

Let me get one thing out in the open:  I am a huge fan of Acclaim's Burnout series.  The intense racing, blazing sense of speed, nerve-wracking crashes, and traffic-weaving are all amazing, and (I thought) unmatched among arcade racers.Enter Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit 2.EA's cop chaser came out about the time of Burnout 2: Point of Impact, which meant I was having such a blast with Burnout that I completely ignored NFS.  But I kept hearing about how cool NFS was, so I gave it a rent, after exhausting Burnout, and was shocked out of my socks by the result:  I think NFS: HP2 is a superior game, all things considered.I will admit that Burnout 2 looks better, runs faster, and has a certain European style that I find highly appealing - not to mention the immortal Crash Mode.  Hot Pursuit 2 might not have the technical advantages of Burnout, but what it lacks in style, it more than makes up for with substance.First off, having licensed cars DOES make a difference.  Blasting round a curve in a Ferrari is miles more sexy than speeding through the streets in a Sports Car.  And what licenses:  Porsche, Lambroghini, Aston Martin, Jaguar, BMW, Corvette!  All modeled accurately, and gorgeously - there are over forty cars in all.NFS's gameplay has more depth as well.  While Burnout can seem at times like a tech demo for its superlative crash physics, NFS concentrates strictly on the racing.  The well-rendered courses are long, with single laps lasting three minutes, and riddled with shortcuts that can make or break the race.  Should I risk taking the narrow back road through the canyon and possibly nab first place, or play it safe and hope the other guys screw up?  EA deserves a big hand for producing some of the most devious clever track designs you're likely to see.You have a wealth of options to customize the races as well.  All the cars have two different settings for handling:  Classic (i.e. safe) or Extreme (for the powerslide freaks).  You can race with commuter traffic on or off, car damage on or off, lap number, controller configuration, AI difficulty, weather conditions, camera views, HUD, car color.....I hope you're getting the picture.  You can even adjust the licensed in-game soundtrack to play instrumentals only.  Not since the Dreamcast's beloved Metropolis Street Racer has an arcade racer had so many options.There are several race modes as well, which break down roughly into two categories:  Hot Pursuit (i.e. the cops are lurking) and World Racing (no cops).  Each mode has a 30+ race bracket with individual challenges, which get progressively tougher.  The races also range from timed runs to GPs to some where you drive as the police themselves, chasing down reckless speeders under a strict time limit.  Whereas Burnout can be beaten within a rental period, it'll take quite a while to unlock everything in HP2.  And the variety, constant unlocked items, and non-linear branching gameplay ensures that it never gets repetitive.While World Racing is noteworthy in its own right, Hot Pursuit is where the gloves come off.  As you & your opponents (or a friend) barrel along the twisting roads, the police are waiting.  You've got a radar detector that lets you know when you're targeted, as well as a scanner that contains some brilliant cop commentary:  "27 to Central, I'm tracking a green Lotus Elisse that's doing 100+ and driving on the shoulder.  Let's test his air bags."  Ha ha - just try it.  Elude the black & whites for a while, and they might call for a roadblock.  Or a spike strip.  Or a bomb-dropping helicopter.  Yeah, it's all over-the-top, but oh man, what a rush:  four cops on your tail, weaving around commuter traffic, dodging bombs from above, all while hanging onto first place by the skin of your teeth.  Even the most traffic-choked Burnout streets didn't get this insane.  Then you hear that police cruiser smash into a wall, and your scanner says:  "27 to Dispatch - my cruiser is out of commission.  Am unable to continue pursuit.  Over."  Awwww yeah!Did I mention you can play as the cop and chase down your friends......even calling in the chopper and roadblocks to stop them?  And that you can unlock Corvette and Murcielago versions of a police cruiser?  Let the trash-talking begin.My intent is not to bash Burnout 2 at all - it's a definite keeper based on the amazing graphics and Crash Mode - but as far as pure pulse-pounding intense arcade racing action, I've never played anything as fun and insane as Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit 2.  Toss sim racing out the window and smash down the accelerator - this game'll give you whiplash!

This is a must-try game.NFSHP2 is for the ELITE video game driving simulator fans... the ones who cut their teeth playing video games using nothing but a keyboard since the start! I remember playing NFS1, NFS2, NFS2 SE, NFS3 Hot Pursuit, NFS4 High Stakes, Porsche Unleashed, Viper Racing, and a myriad of other driving simulators using just my keyboard and ranking in the top all the time.I thought I should mention this because a lot people whine about simulators that do not work well with their overpriced accessories like force feedback steering wheels, pedals, etc... which BTW do not feel even remotely like real steering wheels, pedals, etc... I walked into CompUSA and tried all the high end toys like the top of the line FF wheels, etc... and they may be fine for kiddies who want to play driving games, but in real life the steering feel isn't even remotely the same as a force feedback wheel. You have about 4 full turns from lock to lock. Most FF wheels are what, 1/2 turn from lock to lock?Also the pedals don't feel right most of the time. The vacuum brake booster combined with the hydraulic proportioning valve on the brake lines gives the pedal a firm but slightly "soft" feeling and allows for easy modulation. The throttle also has some resistance in the cable.Back to the game:Need for Speed HP2 plays very much like Need for Speed High Stakes style graphics and gameplay mixed with the Porsche Unleashed physics - just a bit more arcadish. I always felt Porsche Unleashed was one of the more realistic driving simulators... especially when piloting that GT-1 in turns, you could feel the in-game steering jump/turn with the road surface but after awhile it gets frustrating.Need for Speed High Stakes has always been my favorite NFS game since it allowed easy access to modifying the cars - you could easily get McLaren F1's as police cars chasing after you. You would no longer get away from a Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor or a Chevrolet Caprice in your McLaren F1. Now you'd have a Police McLaren going wide open on your six!I started modifying the cars in the game and there are LOTS of options for doing so - so long as you know the terminology.Check out the car.ini files for each of the cars and you'll see what I mean. I can give cars AWD, FWD, or an open differential in the back... driving a peg-leg RWD car has never been more fun or hectic!!! Try out a modified Crown Vic with driving wheel = 2 (passenger rear tire only) and you'll know what it feels like driving in the snow with an open differential on a 99-up Crown Vic. Not exactly fun on slippery roads.The cars have unique engine sounds (i.e. the Cobra R has a distinct V8 growl at wide open, while the 4-bangers sound like 4-bangers) and the physics are extremely similar to Need for Speed Porsche Unleashed only it's more arcadish than a pure simulation, and in my opinion, this increases the fun factor. If I wanted a real, and I mean REAL driving simulator, I would just log some time on a real race track.Pros: Fun Factor is increased with the slightly more arcadish driving physics, but it's not unlike Porsche Unleashed. Spin outs aren't as easy to get out of as they were in NFS: High Stakes. Lots of cars to choose from, with unique engine sounds. Fun to play with using a standard keyboard. Games that REQUIRE steering wheels and pedals may be ultra realistic but they totally detract from the FUN FACTOR.Cons: Not extremely realistic - for those who want realism, go with NASCAR Season 2003 w/ a steering wheel + pedals.Note: I felt the music wasn't the BEST but it's music that I'd want on the radio while driving. I hate it when I'm at the race track and the radio is playing soft jazz or classical music.After extended playing of this game, I found that there were indeed only 4 tracks being recycled over and over again, and that there's no weather changing or night driving. These are a big oversight, BUT IMHO the game makes up for these with a better editing system. I can go into the ini files for each car and modify the sway bars, tire sizes, wheel diameters, brake material and rotor size, etc... and it'd have a big effect on handling!I.e. after setting up my Z8 for a tendency to have a bit more oversteer, I was zipping through S-curves like it was a rally race and I was doing MUCH better against the police. I was more in control and could PIT the cop cars, forcing them to stop chasing me. All I did was modify the tire sizes, brake rotor sizes, and cut some weight from the car (about 100-125 lb ala weight reduction kits).The game dropped in price to the lowest it will go before it'll be discontinued. Go out and try this game. But beware, if you hated Need for Speed Hot Pursuit and High Stakes, chances are you will not like HP2. If you loved Porsche Unleashed and NASCAR Racing Season 2002 and 2003, chances are you may not like HP2 if you're a realism-nut.

I've been into videogames since Night Driver.  Grand Turismo 4 is the best racecar game in existence.  It is also the finest specimen of graphic achievement on the PlayStation 2.  The entire system works.  The game is meant for the most capable recent home video systems.  Put the game in, turn on the high def television, turn up the surround sound, and you'll be hooked from the moment you see the green light.The game has a complete sound system work-up, meaning Dolby Surround (II) audio.  The rear speakers activate when a car is behind you.  The ambient sound in the game is great.  You can completely control over four hours of music tracks.  You can also control the volume levels of the ambience, the engine noise, and the CD music.  The music has a complete variety including rock to rap, techno to classical.  You make the playlist.  You can make a seperate playlist for a photo show.The visuals are awesome.  The game runs in high def widescreen at  1080-interlaced, plain anamorphic widescreen, or the NTSC 4:3.  This is a beautiful game.  The in-game menu has picture adjustment controls to get the right look for each viewer's video rig including contrast, brightness, and more, and you can multiply that by two because there are two full sets of controls, one for while driving and another one for the replay.  The landscapes of the raceway circuits in this game will have you gaping in awe.  You get the sensation of speed by the high frame rate and the landscape model artwork.This is the best Grand Turismo ever.  This game puts the entire race spectrum, of all backgrounds, into the pot and layers music to it, and that's in the metaphoric sense of music.  You can prefer Formula, LeMans, Rally, Indy Cart, or NASCAR.  You can prefer trucks, SUVs, old V8s, stationwagons, 2-seater spyders, or cars less than 3400mm in length.  You can prefer superchargers, turbos, or naturally-aspirated vehicles.  You can prefer hardtops, softtops, no tops or moon roofs.  You can prefer 2-doors, 3-doors, 4-doors, or 5-doors.  You can prefer 4, 6, 8, or 12 cylinders.  You can prefer 3 speeds, 4 speeds, 5 speeds, 6 speeds, or 1-speeds.  You can prefer extra soft tires, extra hard tires, stock tires, sport tires, race tires, dirt tires, or snow tires.  You can prefer rear-engine, mid-engine, or front-engine.  You can prefer front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive, or all-wheel drive. You can prefer gasoline engines, diesel engines, electric engines, or engines by hand crank.  You can prefer a circuit that has 30-second laps or 10-minute laps.  You can prefer oval tracks, mountainous tracks, forest tracks, city tracks, or circuit tracks.  You can prefer tracks that really exist or tracks that do not exist, daytime or nighttime, and from a pace car or from a starting grid.  You can prefer tarmac tracks, stone tracks, dirt tracks, or snow tracks.  You can drive an autobahn in Germany, or let your team drive.  You can prefer stock cars, race cars, touring cars, rally cars, or street cars.  You can prefer American cars, British cars, German cars, Swedish cars, French cars, Italian cars, Australian cars, Belgian cars, or Japanese cars.This game truly has everything, and you get to manage a pit crew.GT4 is the best Turismo game because it perfects its gaming system and neglects any slight flaw of previous Turismos.  The ONLY part I missed was Turismo 3's masterful introduction video microscopically touring the inside of an engine to Lenny Kravitz rock music, because it amazes me every time, whereas GT4's intro vid rather promotes it's new photo gimmick: I like the gimmick, but the vid's not as artistic as GT3, even if the Van Halen song's nice.  I have only one recommendation: I like having lap records and track records that state the driver, the car, and the record time, which was best done in the first Turismo.One more thing, the graphics are done so well, I can tell that each vehicle has a different camera perspective in its distance from the ground.  For instance, when driving in an SUV, your seated position should be much higher than, let's say, a Formula 1 Ferarri; and in this game, each car's "ride height" is different.  I read a negative comment the person can't judge distance very well in this game.  (He owns an X-Box.)  I sympathize because I have the same trouble; BUT, from a real F1 Ferarri, the driver sits so close to the ground and drives so fast, it's impossible not to have to use landmarks!  NO ONE CAN SEE A TURN WHOSE EYE-LEVEL IS ABOUT 2 FEET OFF THE GROUND.  This is one of the smarter features GT4 provides.  GT4 has, to me, a very credible sense of speed!

The ONLY part I missed was Turismo 3's masterful introduction video microscopically touring the inside of an engine to Lenny Kravitz rock music, because it amazes me every time, whereas GT4's intro vid rather promotes it's new photo gimmick: I like the gimmick, but the vid's not as artistic as GT3, even if the Van Halen song's nice.  I have only one recommendation: I like having lap records and track records that state the driver, the car, and the record time, which was best done in the first Turismo.One more thing, the graphics are done so well, I can tell that each vehicle has a different camera perspective in its distance from the ground.  For instance, when driving in an SUV, your seated position should be much higher than, let's say, a Formula 1 Ferarri; and in this game, each car's "ride height" is different.  I read a negative comment the person can't judge distance very well in this game.  (He owns an X-Box.)  I sympathize because I have the same trouble; BUT, from a real F1 Ferarri, the driver sits so close to the ground and drives so fast, it's impossible not to have to use landmarks!  NO ONE CAN SEE A TURN WHOSE EYE-LEVEL IS ABOUT 2 FEET OFF THE GROUND.  This is one of the smarter features GT4 provides.  GT4 has, to me, a very credible sense of speed!
The Gran Turismo franchise was my first venture into simulation console racing and from the onset I was fascinated with its depth and challenge.  By the time 4 came out, I was desperate to acquire it, so when I received it as a Christmas gift I was elated.The first thing I did upon opening this game and popping it into the drive was to scroll through the car dealerships and ogle all the vehicles that had been added since the iconic GT3.  "Karmann Ghia, say WHAT?"..."Jay Leno Tank Car...uh...cool?"  But seriously, there are some amazing rides in here (and I really do like the Ghia, AKA VW Typ 14).  Amazingly awesome vehicles include, for a very short list, the road-going BMW M3 GTR, Mercedes CLK-GTR race car, and the Lancia Delta S4 rally car, which, when modified, has the most explosive acceleration you will ever see.Then...gameplay.  The license test thing has always been a love/hate situation.  On the one hand, it presents a linear challenge that familiarizes you with segments of tracks (and whole tracks, for the good ol' S license) and various cars.  Unfortunately, some of the "sage racing advice" given is simply rubbish if applied in real life, and having a game judge whether you are qualified to play it seems a bit ridiculous.  Regardless, I pushed through the license tests and felt increasingly successful each time I achieved a gold medal, then moved on to the racing.Ah, the racing.  Some of the races are simply atrocious.  Let's take an inside peek, for example, at the "24 Hours of Nurburgring."  Oh, Friday night!  What to do, what to do...I know!  I'll sit on my duff and drive a single simulated car on a single simulated track for literally 24 hours straight!  Sounds like a blast!  Things like carpal tunnel, sleep deprivation, starvation, and console overheating will surely NOT be a problem!  Let's get to it!  Oh yeah, and the track is the most challenging not only in the game, but in the whole real world.  And if you don't place first on your first try, enjoy repeating it until you do.  Oh, and take a hint, Polyphony Digital.  In real life, 24 hour races are generally not completed by a single person.Fortunately, the folks at Polyphony Digital who received the game after the folks who decided putting in 24 hour races (yes, plural...more than one) would be bomb, forsaw the above mentioned problems (except console overheating...good thing the GT franchise has never been for XBox 360) and included a B-spec mode!  So.....ok so the term "B-Spec" means absolutely nothing to you?  Fair.  Basically, the affectionately named "B-Spec Bob" is a race slave...ha, ahem, I mean, driver, who really enjoys driving for you and would never ask for any money, who will dutifully complete races lasting 24 hours, and will EVEN let you speed things up by 3x so that the race only takes 8 hours!  Of course, B-Spec Bob is not you.  He will not use opponents as devices to aid in cornering.  He will not cut across the grass because it is clearly faster.  He will not pit if you told him to go fast, even if his tires have completely melted away and he is driving on bare, sparking rims with only fumes rising from the petrol tank.  But he will do races for you for free, and for that we must all thank B-Spec Bob.GT4 did not attempt to venture into any new territory as far as racing goes.  Yes, superbly realistic physics are still here (and who would want them removed?  It's a SIMULATOR).  We still have a variety of real and fake tracks, including all the "GT Classics" and several super slick new layouts such as the stunning Amalfi Coast, which you will want to drive around at 5 MPH to enjoy the scenery.  There are still rally stages, albeit with a SUPER ANNOYING "5 second penalty" of computer-controlled throttle cut if you biff a wall or opponent (OR if an opponent hits you like a complete jerk...there is no justice in this game).  You can even race along the Grand Canyon now.  Oh yes, and the clincher.  You can STILL plow violently into six opponent cars, a tunnel wall, a cliff, three barricades, and a flimsy orange nylon fence which behaves like a stone wall to protect the jeering fans behind it, all at 200 miles per hour in a single radical collision, and never lose a chip of paint or risk rollover.  It will slow you down a bit though, so try to avoid it.  However, your car can get dirty over time (although you'll never be able to see that), and washing it for a few quid can improve your lap times!  Okay, GT4, thanks for that.  AT least the new GT5 is reported to include damage, so we can all stop whining.There are some cool new additions, though.  New cars and tracks, nitrous oxide, a drag strip, a really slick photo mode (both in and out of races), and a clean, white background layout make this a great refresh on the successful old formula.Here are the cons of the game; the pros are that it is a super realistic racing simulator with tons of cars and neat extra features.-No damage (GT trademark, until the new one)-Irritating penalties for rally contact (even when it's not your fault)-Audaciously long races-Slightly obtuse B-Spec Bob is free to use, but what's the fun in that?-No Ferraris, Porsches, Maseratis, or Lamborghinis (EA had the license, or something like that)-Considerable amounts of trippy music not available elsewhere (but you can turn it off)-Upgrade system could be improved (who really wants to pay 50 grand for "frame straightening" when there IS NO DAMAGE?)All in all, although I'm now a Forza fan, I still hail GT4 as a wonderful and immersive game that certainly occupied hours of my time (including 8 hours directing B-Spec Bob around the "Green Hell" AKA Nurburgring Nordschliefe).[Oh. P.S.  We get it, Polyphony Digital.  You guys love Nissan cars.  They are pretty sporty, yes.  But including 100 of them in your game was not exactly necessary.  Seriously, you must have had like 92 and then came up with 8 new Skylines to round up to that nice even 100.]

Burnout 3 is the best arcade racer I have ever played, and quite possibly, the best 'traditional' racer likewise.With realistic racing sims flooding the video game market (Gran Turismo, Forza Motorsport) it is nice to see a racing game this simple, and this accessible.  This game is about fast cars, and brain-rattling car crashes.Burnout 3's racing is very straight forward, and rewards you for driving dangerously.  Racing towards oncoming traffic, narrowly avoiding traffic (think Crazy Taxi) and drifting around corners gives you boost, which you can use to increase your speed even further (emphasized by a nice blur effect).  But driving aggressively and taking out your opponents is also rewarded: knock them into the side of the track or oncoming traffic, take them out, and your boost bar wil increase in size and fill up completely.  Crash again, and your boost bar decreases, bringing a nice balance to the gameplay.The racing is ridiculously fast, and drifting around corners and weaving through traffic is addicting.  Better still, it's made more intense by a huge sense of danger...  one crash could lose you the race.The crashes, as in past Burnout games, are out of control.  The cartoony graphics don't make them any less horrifying.  That's the series' claim to fame, and it shows.  Glass shatters, metal crumples, tires fly, cars roll out of control, grinding against pavement, smashing into anything in their path...  It's something to see.Best yet, it isn't just a racer.  In World Tour mode, you'll see all kinds of events (many that you can play on their own any time you want.)  These run from time trials, to Eliminator races (last car to pass the finish line each lap is eliminated until only one is left), road rage (see how many Takedowns you can achieve against three opponents until either the time runs out or your car is destroyed) to Crash mode.Crash mode is where the debris really flies.  Pick a car and barrel towards a busy intersection (with one hundred to unlock and choose from) and see how much destruction you can cause.  Once enough cars block the streets its almost disturbing watching the speeding traffic barrel into the pile-up.  Once a certain number of crashes have occurred, use the Crashbreaker, which causes your car to explode, causing more chaos, and allowing you to steer what remains of your car in slow motion towards power ups and money multipliers.Best of all, this game has a wealth of unlockables.  It keeps track of points you earn for driving well in races, monetary damage caused during crashes, takedowns achieved, and rewards you with cars, new courses, etc. for reaching certain goals.  This not only gives you great incentive to go back and play some more, it is a satisfying way to work for unlockables.This game, especially at its new lower price point, is highly recommended.

Possibly once every year you are presented a game that simply sets a standard for the genre. You are offered a piece of history that will not be forgotten, and perhaps may be the indefinite leader in the future of gaming. In no way, at this time, will any racing simulation ever even compete with what has been formally titled Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec. The title has easily topped the list of what the Playstation 2 can offer, and will live in infamy as the racing game that begat all others on the PS2. I have honestly never been so submerged in a game that breaks all limits for what was once thought to be inconceivable. All time is lost when you experience GT3, and 24 hours may accidentally be lost as you suddenly notice the rising sun to your disbelief. Only when you have felt the sheer presence of what GT3 can bring to your home will you ever truly understand the audacity that this title has furnished. We may need to go back and remember the first two Gran Turismo series, and remind ourselves of what has inspired one of the greatest titles of the year.Back in March of 1998, Gran Turismo saw it's first release and defined what the PSX could present, and began a franchise that is hailed as the best racing series of all time. Gran Turismo 2 was the next addition in the set, and proved to add certain elements that characterized what racing titles needed to replicate. By far the best racer of its time, GT2 was even put in the imperial list of all-time best games, an accomplishment that is rarely seen with racing simulators, as the gameplay at times can become repetitive. However, the Gran Turismo franchise has somehow been able to break out of the mold as just an ordinary racer. They have consistently added gameplay that is both exceedingly in-depth and addictive. No longer is a car just an instrument for winning races, it has been transported into an implausible goal, one that when accomplished fuels the desire for perfection. Every level of enjoyment that real racing can deliver is almost flawlessly enlisted in this series, and for those of you who have missed out on the adventure have literally missed out on video gaming history. Luckily, however, you can still relive any of these journeys through exploration of an aged product, but even better, Sony has given us the opportunity to begin a new venture, one that gives incredible detail to almost every facet, and accomplishes a feat rarely attainable.By now you may know that the Playstation 2 is an incredible machine. Words are barely enough to describe the endless potential it is capable of achieving. Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec has taken full advantage of the PS2, and has given us a glimpse of what is justly obtained by Sony's next-generation console. The pure innovation that has gone into this game is phenomenal. It is easily the best looking game out right now on the PS2, and backs up these visuals with killer gameplay that makes the graphics just that much more enjoyable. Car and track designs have been created perfectly with their real life counterparts, and present the gamer and in-depth look at something that he may never get a chance to experience. Sony has truly put themselves at the top of the 1st Party leaders, and should be very proud of what they have accomplished with GT3. As soon as I started the opening video, my jaw literally dropped as I was preparing for the best racing game ever made. I quickly chose my car and began a journey that would continue many months down the line. As I revved my engine for the start of an exhilarating race, I could hardly concentrate on the road. This was actually how in awe I was of this game. The pure eye to brain stimulation that is created here is outrageous, and you will tell yourself how long you've been waiting for a game like this to knock you off your seat. I simply cannot rant and rave about Gran Turismo 3's visuals anymore, just to tell you that each car can get a maximum of 20,000 polygons and that it is an injustice for you to not expose yourself to the best eye-candy you will see on the PS2 right now.The environments of Gran Turismo 3 are crazy. The detail is so outstanding it's seriously as if you're watching a video of the course every time. A CG video could hardly show a difference between the amazing track design that has been developed here, and I, for one, feel no need for the presence of one. Every aspect in the background is perfectly sculpted, creating a racing environment that is not only exceptional, but in all honesty, overwhelming. As you race through what seem to be perfectly replicated tracks, you may almost want to stop and stare at the scenery. This, however, will cause you to lose every race, and is not advised. However, what you can do is marvel at the sheer beauty that is represented by Gran Turismo 3, and appreciate it for the level it has brought to gaming.When dealing with gameplay for Gran Turismo 3, you might as well say you're dealing with gold. GT3 has basically taken this glamorous racer to a height that few games can reach. It incorporates wants and desires that other titles strive for. Overall, gameplay is near perfect, but it's so much more than that. There are so many elements that need to be examined for you to acceptably understand what type of game we're dealing with here. In that sense, I should almost stop referring to GT3 as a game, for it is far more than that. Gran Turismo 3 is the pinnacle of all racing games, and it's stellar scheme and game modes are what set it apart from even the most unique racing titles. Simply put, GT3 centers around 5 different simulation game modes: Beginner, Amateur, Pro, Rally, and Endurance League.There are 6 licenses that need to eventually be obtained and they include License B, A, IB, IA, Rally, and Super. Depending on what tracks and what level you choose will depend on the license you will need to get. A standard of Gold, Silver, and Bronze will be set, and will need to be broken for the numerous tests presented at the License Center. Receiving your licenses and taking the tests is a great way to get a feel of how the control setup and mechanics work for different cars. It is an excellent preparation course, and readies a player for elevated merit when entering their first mode. Also placed in the game is an Arcade mode, which allows players to advance through selected courses and cars, and also distributes a brilliant 2-player feature that initiates competitive racing. For me, the Arcade mode was also a pronounced source to prepare for Simulation mode, and offered time trials that can be utilized perfectly when getting associated with Gran Turismo 3. As you venture through Simulation mode, the object is to obtain as many high-quality cars as possible, while excelling in numerous race series and circuits for necessary funding. I found this to be incredibly addicting, and the portion of the game that will challenge hours upon hours of your time.The considerable number of cars presented is far less than GT2, but are of higher quality. Each car is separated into their noted company and assorted countries. While you are only allocated $18,000 to purchase your first car, the process has already begun. What will follow next is the endless desire to own top-notch cars and soup them up to speeds of exceedingly high proportions. While easily posting some of the best cars to grace any street at this time, GT3 lacks the company of old-time cars, excluding the lone Shelby Cobra. This is the only element that caused me to remove a tenth of a point from my score, and is something I hope will be remarkably looked into by Sony. Granted, a small amount of development time was given to Sony and their developers of GT3, but the presence of older style cars is an aspect that cannot be simply overlooked. However, as I've stated, the gameplay of this title is incomparable, and the very small problems associated with GT3 are so vastly overshadowed that one may forget any minor flaws. I can easily say this the all-time most addicting games I have ever played. A bold statement, yes, but undoubtedly backed up with amazing game physics and a setup that may need a patent for assurance.The sound executed in GT3 is overall a gem. Combining both incredible sound affects and a fantastic soundtrack, Sony has once again come through with an element of a game that can truly either make or break a game. When considering the sound effects, car engines and squealing tires are portrayed at such a high standard you may actually have to check in front of your house to see that no one has just sped by in a drag race fashion. The soundtrack is one of the best I've heard in a racing title, and besides a few setbacks in song tracks, an absolute enjoyment to listen to while racing. Your adrenaline will soar and your breathing will become rapid as you combine every element I have listed so far.If it's real car driving you want, the control of Gran Turismo 3 is flawless. You will never witness the gross misinterpretation that a car traveling 180 mph can turn on a dime. Each turn must be well executed, utilizing the break and correct design path that will drive you into s

However, what you can do is marvel at the sheer beauty that is represented by Gran Turismo 3, and appreciate it for the level it has brought to gaming.When dealing with gameplay for Gran Turismo 3, you might as well say you're dealing with gold. GT3 has basically taken this glamorous racer to a height that few games can reach. It incorporates wants and desires that other titles strive for. Overall, gameplay is near perfect, but it's so much more than that. There are so many elements that need to be examined for you to acceptably understand what type of game we're dealing with here. In that sense, I should almost stop referring to GT3 as a game, for it is far more than that. Gran Turismo 3 is the pinnacle of all racing games, and it's stellar scheme and game modes are what set it apart from even the most unique racing titles. Simply put, GT3 centers around 5 different simulation game modes: Beginner, Amateur, Pro, Rally, and Endurance League.There are 6 licenses that need to eventually be obtained and they include License B, A, IB, IA, Rally, and Super. Depending on what tracks and what level you choose will depend on the license you will need to get. A standard of Gold, Silver, and Bronze will be set, and will need to be broken for the numerous tests presented at the License Center. Receiving your licenses and taking the tests is a great way to get a feel of how the control setup and mechanics work for different cars. It is an excellent preparation course, and readies a player for elevated merit when entering their first mode. Also placed in the game is an Arcade mode, which allows players to advance through selected courses and cars, and also distributes a brilliant 2-player feature that initiates competitive racing. For me, the Arcade mode was also a pronounced source to prepare for Simulation mode, and offered time trials that can be utilized perfectly when getting associated with Gran Turismo 3. As you venture through Simulation mode, the object is to obtain as many high-quality cars as possible, while excelling in numerous race series and circuits for necessary funding. I found this to be incredibly addicting, and the portion of the game that will challenge hours upon hours of your time.The considerable number of cars presented is far less than GT2, but are of higher quality. Each car is separated into their noted company and assorted countries. While you are only allocated $18,000 to purchase your first car, the process has already begun. What will follow next is the endless desire to own top-notch cars and soup them up to speeds of exceedingly high proportions. While easily posting some of the best cars to grace any street at this time, GT3 lacks the company of old-time cars, excluding the lone Shelby Cobra. This is the only element that caused me to remove a tenth of a point from my score, and is something I hope will be remarkably looked into by Sony. Granted, a small amount of development time was given to Sony and their developers of GT3, but the presence of older style cars is an aspect that cannot be simply overlooked. However, as I've stated, the gameplay of this title is incomparable, and the very small problems associated with GT3 are so vastly overshadowed that one may forget any minor flaws. I can easily say this the all-time most addicting games I have ever played. A bold statement, yes, but undoubtedly backed up with amazing game physics and a setup that may need a patent for assurance.The sound executed in GT3 is overall a gem. Combining both incredible sound affects and a fantastic soundtrack, Sony has once again come through with an element of a game that can truly either make or break a game. When considering the sound effects, car engines and squealing tires are portrayed at such a high standard you may actually have to check in front of your house to see that no one has just sped by in a drag race fashion. The soundtrack is one of the best I've heard in a racing title, and besides a few setbacks in song tracks, an absolute enjoyment to listen to while racing. Your adrenaline will soar and your breathing will become rapid as you combine every element I have listed so far.If it's real car driving you want, the control of Gran Turismo 3 is flawless. You will never witness the gross misinterpretation that a car traveling 180 mph can turn on a dime. Each turn must be well executed, utilizing the break and correct design path that will drive you into s
I have been a gamer since 1981 in the days of coin op Pac Man, Berserk, Galaga, Centipede, Donkey Kong.  Needless to say I have witnessed every phase of technological breakthroughs of gaming consoles. Back in the day, you knew a game console was awesome if a game cartridge could duplicate the graphics of an Arcade game.  Well, after the year 2000, the had tide changed to where gaming consoles created superior games than what you would find in arcades. This is why arcades only have &iexcl;simulator&iexcl; style games and shooters and I no longer go to arcades. Bear with me, I am going somewhere with this.So now we have the frontrunners of PlayStation and X-Box that have cranked out some pretty sick games and peripherals where you can literally participate in Dance contests and fight in Bare Knuckle street brawls(The Fight PS3 with the Move Controllers). The PS3 and X-box 360 up until last Friday, to me, could not be topped with epic gaming with stunning graphics and game play. I bought my PS4 on the release date and I had Assassins Creed Black Flag that was jaw dropping. Well Infamous Second Son is the most epic game ever created. It has easily topped one of my old time favorite series, &iexcl;Unchartered&iexcl; a PlayStation exclusive. Black Flag is a visually stunning game, but Infamous 2nd Son is even more visually stunning.I have owned MANY PlayStation games and have gotten sucked into many PlayStation games. And quite honestly, up until Infamous 2nd Son, I was actually beginning to get bored with gaming. Black Flag, Kill Zone and some and the new PS4 bred games were really neat, but it&iexcl;s hard to be wowed these days because gaming has advanced so much over the past 14 years.Infamous 2nd Son has accomplished 3 things from my perspective.First, is the creators have made a visually hypnotizing game (hypnotizing because of the use of colors and detail in the cities that make Grand Theft Auto cities look primitive on the lines of Atari 2600) that is not repetitive that is actually never boring and repetitive. You can choose two karma routes which can give you two stories and even different abilities and weaponry based on who you wish to be. I actually plan on going through the game and a bad guy next time. I suggest that the player actually go through all of the side missions and &iexcl;liberations&iexcl; to get the full experience instead of going straight to all of the missions and finishing the game quickly. I have done this with other games because they were repetitive and dull, but it would be a waste on this game. Seriously. My wife is not a game fan but was commenting on the rich neon colors that look like something from a rave party. The cut scenes that show the hero detonating his big attack launching himself in the sky and lowering the boom is the most spectacular thing I have ever seen and it never gets old. What is also good is how you don&iexcl;t get all of the power ups and abilities right off the bat. You gradually get them all as you defeat the other bio-terrorists which keeps you coming back for more. I like how the developers have utilized the controller as a speaker and &iexcl;spray paint can&iexcl; .Second, is that this game has actually piqued this old gamer&iexcl;s interest again to gaming. I like FPS games, but something new and fresh is nice.  This game is just plain fun. Up until last Friday, I was beginning to use my PS4 mostly for Netflix and movie streaming. Well not now.And third and most important, Infamous Second Son has shown what the PlayStation 4 can do. It has displayed the possibilities and potential that this console has. Hopefully, game developers will take the time to utilize the system to its fullest potential to make winners like this. I am looking forward to other PS4 games now and the peripherals that are on the console.
Killzone is a technical marvel of sorts.  It&#8217;s sublime.  The philosopher, Edmund Burke, described the &#8220;sublime&#8221; as the feeling of awe one experiences when faced with something that is both beautiful and terrifying, something that instills fear and uncertainty due to how little we may comprehend its being. You feel simultaneously infinitesimal and enormous in the presence of the sublime. There are moments in Killzone that left me breathless, where I couldn&#8217;t help but just stare.  I&#8217;m grateful to report that video games, at last, have taken their rightful place next to the great mediums of expression: literature, architecture, music, film, etc.  Advancements in technology, coupled with a passion for creative gaming experiences, is the formula that will jettison this age into an era where games will be respected for what they essentially are: works of art.95% of your experience playing Killzone will be the most s***-inducing excitement you've ever felt playing a video game.  I award it a perfect score for three main things: the mind-bogglingly gorgeous visuals, how fun it is to play, and its sound design.Two friends and I devoured nearly half of it on the Saturday night after the PS4 was released, and we were so thoroughly hooked that we could hardly eat the pizza we'd just ordered.  We were that stunned.  It's the sort of game where you will stop &#8220;playing,&#8221; and instead just simply look around so you can analyze the world that's been created, just for you.  Prepare to be inundated with a stunning level of detail.  This is a very handsome game.  A friend of mine, who is a developer, was able to expound on a panoply of technical terms: I learned about volumetric lighting, blooming, bump mapping, specular lighting, and ambient occlusion, to name a few.  Before Killzone, my interest in video games merely tiptoed in the minutiae of design; now my level of appreciation has been galvanized by sincere wonderment.The story, though, is just ok, and there are two moments where I got a little frustrated.  The ending will polarize gamers: I was personally underwhelmed.  But as I said earlier, my love for this game is more concerned with the fun I had playing it, the visuals, and the sound design.  And why has nobody mentioned that last detail yet?  This is both the best looking AND best sounding game I've personally ever played.  Make sure your speakers are cranked, and prepare for sonic bliss.  I&#8217;d love to see the keyboard and program that were used to make the soundtrack.  Some of the songs are surprisingly catchy; occasionally I would just stop and listen to the music.Killzone isn't flawless, God knows it tries; but where it's good, it's simply brilliant.  Above all, this game is a statement about what is to come, and I&#8217;m extremely excited to see what developers do next with PS4 exclusives.  Anyone who is passionate and fascinated by video games needs to experience this game, at least for its technical aspects.  It&#8217;s thrilling to know you&#8217;re a part of history, that you are one of the first gamers to experience this exciting shift into next-gen technology.
When the game released back in October, it was almost universally panned by the major gaming sites and magazines. And while, yes, the game was released in a shoddy state, the reviews it received were, as far as I've seen over the years, left solely for utterly broken messes with little to no fun factor to be found.Rough? Yes. Broken? Not by any means. The game was indeed shipped in a rough state. The fact that EA decided to hold review copies, leaving gaming sites and publications to purchase the game on their own and review it post-release, wasn't a good sign either and shows that EA acknowledges it wasn't in proper shape at release. This, however, I think did more to damage the game than anything. Reviewers, understandably annoyed with this, were stuck with rushing out reviews in order to meet a questioning public. What this means is that we received rushed, and very likely biased, reviews from the industry as a whole - Unfairly critical in almost every way. This is more than evident in the actual meat of reviews, touching on many issues found in the other two large Modern Military shooters of today (short, straight-forward campaign, net issues at launch, etc), though finishing it with a score far below what is seen otherwise. And, in all honesty, Battlefield 3(a game that I love, by the way), released in a far buggier state, with many glaring balance and net issues and a weaker singleplayer campaign(the main reason for reviewers taking points off), though received a metacritic rating(not that I much approve of the site, but it helps prove my point in this situation) of over thirty points higher overall.Seems the best reviewers had to say about the game was that it was a properly executed military shooter without a personality of its own(which I disagree with) - though without a score representative of such a statement. With so much hypocrisy to be found in such reviews when comparing them to those of the other Modern Military big boys, I feel that many of these reviews should be called out as just that - hypocritical. If reviewers are truly tired of what is on offer from today's military shooter, it should be reflective in the reviews of all that fall into that category, not just the games that they choose. It's as simple as that.From someone who put a sizable amount of time into the game's multiplayer, I don't see how there is any way that reviewers had enough time to properly critique the multiplayer of the game. This is largely based around the class you play, learning to work with your teammate(Fireteam Buddy) and your choice of soldier and weapon customization. For them to have the reviews out in the time they did . . . I just don't see how we should ever consider them reviews. They were little more than first impressions, written by an annoyed group of "journalists' - a word I use extremely lightly in situations like this.Unpolished, yet extremely satisfying, I find that Medal of Honor:Warfighter is a game most certainly worth owning. It does things, both in singleplayer and multiplayer, far different than the big boys of the Modern Military sub-genre, and it deserves to be noticed. While the likelihood of the series to continue is low, and official support of the game minimal at the moment, there is still a strong, dedicated community surrounding the game and the release as a whole has only improved since launch. The UI has been vastly improved, as well as the net code - two of the most glaring issues with the game when it first released. Other than that, balancing is pretty much where it should be, which was more or less true at launch, honestly. The game can now be bought new for around $30, and, at that price, I wholly give it my recommendation. It's a very well balanced, team based fps with proper maps and satisfying shooting mechanics.
If you've never played these games, then you can prepare yourself for some fun platforming; evolving from game to game. And please don't let the 4 rating scare you away. These are excellent games. They look great, sound great, and have some unique ideas (for the time they were made) which are generally executed with a high level of success. One great thing about this collection is that these are all pretty different titles. So if you don't like the one you're playing, simply switch to another. Trophies come fast and don't require any outrageous feats in order to obtain the platinums. You'll just be playing the games and enjoying the experience of doing so.So, why the 4? Well, the offering still suffers in ways which weren't even forgivable at the time of their release. While the games will often remind you of Mario's amazing 3D platforming romps, the camera will soon feel like your worst enemy later in the progression of each game. Also, I had forgotten just how much these depend on the use of double-jumps. Those are neat to include here and there, but 9 out of every 10 jumps seems a bit much.Again though, that isn't to say that these are bad games. They aren't. They're simply flawed in ways you're going to notice. Beyond these flaws however are some truly wonderful games that deserve your attention. So do not skip this one. Even at the full asking price, you are getting a lot of bang for your buck!
9.5/10 (not a perfect "10," but pretty darn close)Hmmm...where to begin. Perhaps we could start with discussion regarding the grave injustice that has been committed not only against American McGee and co., but against all gamers looking for something that's truly impactful and worth its going rate (for a change). Or, perhaps we could start with discussion regarding the (seemingly obvious) fact that game critics (as a whole) seem to be blinded by an overwhelming fear of ridicule (at the hands of their peers in the "game reviewing" business, of course), or perhaps more prominently, an overwhelming fear of termination, should they be brave enough to break free from the flock. Therefore, we can only rely on the much more beneficial critique of the "common gamer" through trusted sources such as Metacritic, Gamestop, and Gamespot/IGN user reviews, who seems to be far more in tune with what makes a game "worth playing," "immersive," and "memorable," as an *experience*, as opposed to "good" or "excellent" on a technical level (invisible walls, a couple weak textures here and there, etc.), as most game critics seem to apply far too much weight to (probably because they don't play the games through until completion). Please note that I have never played the original "Alice" game, so it's important to remember that this review is based solely on my impressions of its sequel, knowing nothing of the gameplay, graphical quality, or most importantly, impact, of the first title.Before I delve any further into detail of any aspect of this stunningly artistic and endlessly engrossing game (that I am hopelessly obsessed with), let me please say "thank you" to Amazon.com for permitting me to steal it from them for just $8.99 USD; had this opportunity not arisen, thanks to the game's absurd mediocre (critic) review consensus (the gaming public seems to strongly disagree [thank you, Metacritic]), I would have most certainly missed out on the best gaming experience of 2011. Again, "thank you," Amazon, with all the sincerity I can muster (note: Gamestop was also offfering the download for $8.99; alas, that offer has also ended).First, let's get the technical stuff out of the way first (as it's of the least importance in terms of whether or not a game is worth playing, contrary to critical opinion); the game, quite simply, runs beautifully if you've got the hardware (minus the PhysX smoke that will decimate your framerate). Minus "smoky" battles, the game runs perfectly smoothly (60fps, locked), all settings maxed, at 1080p with around 50% GPU utlization (560ti @ 950 MHZ; 2500k @ 4.3 Ghz), and it looks absolutely amazing doing so (more on this later), contrary (from what I've heard) to the console versions. Sure, there's an "invisible wall" from time to time, but as it never affects gameplay in any relevant way (in my experience), I'll have to disagree with the critics that this is apparently worth deducting what I estimate to be at least a full point (out of ten) for. Let's call it a .5% reduction. Done. Why? The game flows beautifully, all else considered. The controls are tight and perfectly responsive (note: I use a 360 controller, as this is vastly preferable to me than mouse/keyboard [not to mention I game on a 46" 1080p and am therefore not sitting most uncomfortably at a desk, as does the stereotypical "PC gamer"...]), and Alice is very easy to control; unlike most hack-and-slash games out there, there aren't three-hundred superflously arbitrary button-smashing combinations for someone to agonizingly attempt to memorize for little actual gameplay or enjoyment benefit. Technical score: ANow, on to what matters.First, Let's talk about what really makes a game "good," and what game reviews should therefore focus on (and typically don't, at least these days). For me, personally (a "hardcore" gamer with over 25 years of experience), it isn't any of the things that nearly all critical reviews seem to focus on: graphics, sound, etc. Sure, they matter. However, graphics and sound (and an invisible wall here and there) don't make the game, and they certainly don't make it "memorable" or worthy of 9.0+ (out of ten) scores. What, then, are the keys? In my opinion, it's simply a series of questions that couldn't be more simple:a). Did you feel as though you "loved" the game (and/or character(s)), and did this only intensify as the game progressed?b). Upon the game's conclusion, did you feel hopelessly compelled to begin another quest (thank God for "new game +"), in spite of the five or more games you might have downloaded after this one and not played yet?c). While playing the game, were there numerous moments where you simply sat in front of your screen in awe of what you were witnessing (artistically, etc.)? How big was the smile on your face, or how trance-like was your state (how absorbed were you into the moment)?d). How likely are you to emphatically recommend the game to another and tell them how amazing or truly one-of-a-kind it is (regardless of any reason you can vocalize at said time)?Really, that's all there is to it. Now, if I go back and look at the average game that say, IGN or Gamespot has given a 9.0 or higher within the past generation(or even 2011, specifically), what will I find? Say I compared these scores to the average gamer score...what's the standard deviation of critcally-scored 9.0 titles vs. gamer scores?What irks me most is that, without looking, I already know the answers and implications of these questions.Anyway, you want specifics? Sure.Let's start with the supposed graphic quality problem that so many reviewers have taken issue with (fuzzy textures, etc.). First, I find it quite ironic that a game that maxes out a 560ti (overclocked, as it were) on a regular basis could take hits for graphic quality. Quite simply, at 1080p/60fps maxed settings, the image quality is simply amongst the best out there (minus Battlefield 3, of course [the game's one redeeming quality, in my opinion]), which only helps the art design (which is amongst the best I've seen; more on this later). I'd like to simply state that I am most impressed with Alice's hair; it's amazingly realistic, and I'm still not sure how it was done (I don't believe it's PhysX, since it seems to be identical in console editions [and because consoles suck, they aren't PhysX capable]).How about the game's music? Quite simply, it's mesmerizing, and is utterly beautiful, much like every other aspect of the game. From the opening screen, the music draws you in emotionally and doesn't let go. Ironically, it seems that the sequel's music doesn't match up to the original's (from what I've read), but based on the sampling I've done online, I'd have to disagree. It's simply stylistically different...much more subdued and mellow, but equally or even more engaging and trancendent than the original's (though one track of the sequel, I've read, was created by the original conductor [it's immediately obvious which one it is, as you progress through the game]).In terms of gameplay, sure, it's somewhat "old-fashioned." From what I've read, it's a near duplication of the original title, which, it seems to me, was heavily inspired by Super Mario 64 (note: this is not just a good thing, but an excellent one). As mentioned before, it's a good measure of hack-and-slash combined with straight-forward platforming, and quite fortunately, we aren't required to try to memorize various combinations of button-mashing that add little or nothing to the actual enjoyment of the gameplay. Just like most other games on the market, the gameplay is somewhat repetitive, which is somewhat amplified given the solid length of this game. However, I have to believe that most reviewers that slammed this game for its "repetitve" gameplay failed to play the game through to completion, as there are indeed variations that I wouldn't dream of spoiling here. Trust me; it's worth playing this game through to the end (and I recommend that any critics that didn't do so go back and discover what they missed). Ultimately, regardless of the game's length (about twelve hours the first time; I expect fifteen or more the second [aiming for 100% completion this time around]), no matter how long some stages occasionally felt, I was nothing but overjoyed at the thought of playing through the entire title again (much unlike most titles these days, which I can't even reach the presumed midpoint of due to my boredom and disinterest). That, to me, is the surest sign of a game that's worth being a part of a collection.Alas, the game cannot be deemed to be "perfect," as close as it comes; I have three notable gripes (that incidentally could easily have been solved with a patch):a). all mini-games (not just some) should be made "skippable" (I find them tedious and unnecessary, but as they were all the result of outsourced production houses (so I read), I can't weigh them heavily in the overall score)b). stages two (Waterworld) and three (Asialand) are about 25% too long (both drag a bit toward the end and seem unnecessarily elongated; the game's run-time is twelve hours, where ten hours would have been perfect)c). bottles don't seem to have any relevance but as pointless collectibles; had they had messages in them, e.g., collecting them would have been much more interestingThese quibbles aside, I genuinely feel that this was the best game of 2011; perhaps there were a couple "invisible walls" here and there, and no, the game isn't technically "perfect," but for me, it was the most thoroughly enjoyable, escapist, memorable, and emotionally impacting game of the year (by a wide margin). Again, I feel that these traits are, generally speaking, the things that really matter, as video games (now more than ever) are something to be *experienced*, as a whole...and what is an experience but the emotion it creates? Anyway, it's back to playing the game, for me...download it now and come to the conclusion, like me, that game critics, as a community, need to take a step back and rediscover what video-gaming is supposed to be about (and what truly makes a game worth our time and money and is therefore worthy of 90+% scores...).Edit: because you must not play this game limited to 31fps (for God's sake and your own), here's what you need to do (right now...do not play the game before doing this):C:\Users\(your name here...)\Documents\My Games\Alice Madness Returns\AliceGame\ConfigOpen AliceEngine.ini, press control and f simultaneously, enter "smooth;" you should see the below:bSmoothFrameRate=TRUEMinSmoothedFrameRate=22MaxSmoothedFrameRate=31Make it look like this:bSmoothFrameRate=TRUEMinSmoothedFrameRate=40MaxSmoothedFrameRate=60...save the file, and enjoy the game at 60fps (assuming your hardware is capable of it; it takes a 560 (give or take) to max the game at 1080p/60fps, and also a decent CPU [my 2500k at 4.3 uses about 30% (of the typically 50% available to most games, as most games can't utilize more than two cores simultaneously)]).
Rating: A+You would honestly think that any game made by Square, in the era right after they relesed Final Fantasy Seven would have gotten more recognition than this game did, but unfortunately it did not, easily becoming an underground type sensation that few could argue, is not only one of the classic shoot-em-ups on the Playstation, but one of the best Side scrolling shooters of all time. Taking place in the all too distant future, we find ourselves jumping into the helm of three vastly different ships, which upon receiving different weapons, mount themselves on your ship in different ways depending upon which ship you have chosen. Each level is vastly different from the next, and each boss requires a methodical and increasing harder approach to defeat it, learning the patterns and timings of each boss is a must if you even want to get past the third level. With secrets galore and 2 unlockable ships (if memory serves me correct), the game is loaded to the rims with extras that will keep you glued to your tv for hours, wondering how in the hell this game is so addicting. Well in one sense the exceedingly difficult gameplay, drives you to want to see what the next level has to offer, while the actual process of figuring out the best route through each stage, while acquiring the best weapons to be used against each boss comes down to a science, and literally you have to become "One" with the controller, and basically let your senses take over, as this is probably right up there with Contra: Shattered Soldiers in terms of overall difficulty. But let me tell you the second you step foot into the final stage in the midst of an all out war against you, and only you, this game turns the world on you as you battle in space and fight off against one of the hugest RoboTech inspired bosses ever. Phenomenal music accompanies this blissful experience, as the pounding techno music even made me import the soundtrack from Japan, as I just could not get enough of the game and its music. It is unfortanate that the game never really made the waves it should have stateside, as I'm sure Square's reluctant to release a sequel, due to the games lackluster sales, but then again it just moves it right up there with Radiant Silvergun (probably THE best shooter of all time), in terms of one of those games you mention to someone, and there either like "What game?" or "Oh my friggin' God that game is so amazing." Praobably one of the best games you've never heard about or will get a chance to play, good luck finding it, and even greater luck trying to master it and beat it. Impeccable.

My first experience w/ the GTA franchise was at my friend's birthday party in Dec. 2001. He received GTA3 as a gift that night, and we all watched him play it for a while. Lots of drunken hooting and hollering at the wanton random violence and depravity. Running over pedestrians, cop-killing sprees with countless innocent bystander casualties, partaking of a prostitute's services for a health bonus and then beating her to death with a baseball bat to recoup the money paid to her, and so forth. I didn't dig that particular aspect too much. I wasn't personally offended, per se... I love over the top violence in games and movies. But I had something of a political issue with it due to my perspective as a long-time gamer. To wit- for two decades up to that point, annoying "concerned parent" groups had been decrying video games as "murder simulators" that condition and desensitize, destroy the moral compass, blah blah blah. Those groups had always been completely full of crap, but it seemed to me that in one fell swoop GTA 3 was going to make them all correct, retro-actively. I thought "We've been in the right all these years. But now you've released the game those nitwits have been waiting for, and it's finally going to give them the upper hand. Good job, guys." There was also the simple fact that I've always been more drawn towards fantasy, whether it's futuristic sci-fi, swords & sorcery, supernatural horror, a past time period, whatever, I need *something* aside from mundane reality. A video game where you're a just some Joe Schmoe running around a modern city driving contemporary cars... that simply wasn't going to satisfy my appetite for escapism. So, it felt like around the time I was going ga-ga over Devil May Cry, Ico, Metal Gear Solid 2, Final Fantasy X and Halo, everyone else was falling madly in love with GTA3. Especially my aforementioned friend. He would not shut up about how great it was and he was so enthusiastic and positive that I'd love it too if I gave it a chance that I bought myself a copy. I played it for a few hours, long enough to confirm that it definitely wasn't my cup of tea, and I put it away in the cabinet under my TV. It's been sitting in there ever since.I then watched as GTA3 went on to become one of the most revolutionary and influential video games of all time, giving birth to a whole new genre, i.e. open world/sandbox. Naturally I avoided this genre like the plague... until Assassin's Creed. I initially dismissed that game as well, since A) I had never been won over by Prince of Persia-Sands of Time and B) it appeared to be GTA set in the 12th century Middle East. But later I heard that it also had some kind of hi-tech sci-fi aspect, so that piqued my interest and I ended up playing it. Flawed as it was, that broke the ice and got me past my aversion towards open world games. After three Assassin's Creeds, Infamous, Red Dead Redemption, and most recently L.A. Noire, I was finally ready. I opened that cabinet under my TV, fished out GTA3 and started a new game. That was about two weeks ago, and now I've finished it. A lot of it was boring; there's no getting around the fact that you spend most of your time driving around Liberty City. I drive around Los Angeles every day, so this is not exactly exciting to me. Bits of it were aggravating; in the first 30 missions or so the GPS always indicates precisely where my next goal is... and suddenly that is taken away for no apparent reason. I'm directed to go find a "Yardie car" without any info as to just what in the hell a Yardie is or kind of car they drive. Y'know, the sort of thing that Official Guide Books and the internet were created for. But a lot of it was a hell of a lot of fun, and I'm glad that I can finally appreciate what it did for gaming. Thanks to eBay, after finishing up GTA3 I cracked open an original sealed copy of Vice City and started in on that (I can already tell it contains some big improvements,) and I've got a sealed copy of San Andreas waiting in the wings. Now my biggest issue with these games is whether or not I can finish them before I burn out.EDIT August 8, 2011: Since writing this review I've gone on to enjoy Vice City, San Andreas, GTA4, The Lost and Damned, and The Ballad of Gay Tony. I am now a true blue GTA fan. Who'da thunk it? I've been looking up old articles and interviews about the history of GTA and its developer Rockstar, and I found out something very enlightening: When they initially came up with the ideas that were the foundation for the GTA series, one of the most important goals was to create a new game that would appeal to people who normally weren't interested in video games because they thought of them as "nerdy". Being that I had been playing and loving video games for about 25 years by the time GTA first appeared in 1997, it's hardly any wonder that it didn't interest me. I wasn't anywhere near the target demographic.

My jaws sunk low, self-emitting air filed around me, and stupidly I gawked at my PC screen. Since when did a game rekindle my fancy for the first form of literature I warmly embraced? Anime, at times, is juiced up with vague or unnecessary talk with global weight on crushing action, but comic books have grown as a nippy alternative to time-consuming novels with marvelously penciled scenes. Where comics like the dormant Battle Chasers and, all-time favorite, Spawn attenuated my reading and visual proclivity, Freedom Force successfully lands on the video game populace in style. Full of tantalization, the game rips a new outfit on the grounds of gaming. I haven't experienced this kind of cunning direction, ever. Irrational Games assembles a flat-out ambiance which thrusts players into thrilling heroism. The RPG/Strategy affiliation shreds awesome gameplay components. Every description in the game is an indication that the company was rapt on fashioning a game based on the comic book medium. Freedom Force takes in all the legacy and stereotypes of the 60's Silver Age, and on the videogame scale, it rumbles.Sweaty-palm action awaits as soon as you decide who to take from a pool of heroes. After selecting four members, you then jump onto the fray and gain following missions. More often than not, your elite band of defenders must put an end to rampaging supervillains along with their loyal minions. Reasonably linear, the lion's share of Freedom Force is the mastered mechanics, and the ironic yet interesting cost of being violent superheroes. Remember anime (or even Power Puff Girls) where the forces of good take it on the open streets, disregarding the safety of structures, and bulldoze it down? As Uncle Ben once said from Spidey comics, "with great power comes even greater responsibility." Ditto, here. Pedestrians mind their walks of life, cars burn rubber, and in the center, a heated clash between the forces of good and evil. Oh, dear! Oh, my! Being reckless may trigger unwanted wreckage of the city that is supposedly under your protection. Depending on your choice of attacks, Patriot City can be decimated to rubble. Strategic usage of the environment (i.e. lifting cars as projectiles) should be limited due to the sensitivity of the backgrounds. From caving buildings to impersonating Babe Ruth with traffic polls, needless destruction is booed.Devilish destruction reduces the bag of important Prestige Points. Awarded after victory, these points are applied to attain additional heroes. EXP points are also given to prime a hero's abilities or expand them. As an incentive to minimize running amok, if you fail to wisely handpick a fit squad, future supervillains will squash your band of heroes into [mush]. Ample with whirls of Real-Time frenzy, a tide of excellent RPG elements, and the aim to prevent harm on Patriot city, Freedom Force is smart as it is witty.Totally smitten with Freedom Force, it hurts to divulge the minimal frowns upon it. In fact, the game gets terribly hectic without any sign of slowing down. Selecting commands may provide golden opportunities for curt surprises from concealed enemies. Failing to detect them means your good guys go down and dead. Without radar or even a teeny map, studying your surroundings seems like a tactical joy, but the constant, overbearing work is strain for the eyes. Trust me, if you thought 4 heroes is depressing petty, it's enough with the brutal and lighting-quick square offs. Also, no automatic pausing is a pain. Frequent instances of tongue-lashing conforms with the in-game chaos. Even so, the robust personality of Freedom Force dwarfs the potholes floating around it. However, far from perfect, there is nothing quite like this and is the closest thing to match a child's interactive role in a comic book.The hero cast is intentionally cheesy as the Super Friends. Stereotypes of the 60's comics (corny dialogue) forges together and packs a full press of eccentricity. Merciless creatures alternatively keep the 90's evil-doer persona unbroken. Expect the trademark of what Marvel Comics originally gave rise to. Where DC presented the typical "superhero stops supervillain," Marvel effectively introduced a new prospective and presented the personal life of its characters. Freedom Force excels on it too. Character growth was nice to witness, but the cast is so overpopulated that various characters are overshadowed by the stars. Cheesy hallmarks and naturally droll, the clowning occasions in Freedom Force deserves recognition.Voice-overs are gallant, funny, and when called for, somber. Excellent themes manage to merge an exclusive fusion of topnotch sound quality while comic-looking graphics that are so colorfully caustic it'll have your gums bleed. Once a "FOOSH," slashed across the screen, I was tickled by my comic book sensibilities. Characters are fleshed out with exaggerated, superhero costumes and work well with the polygonal construction. The interactive 3D environment and superhero powers are very cool to watch when toyed with. The option to tailor the camera view is welcomed, especially when seconds of disorder surface. The thick quality behind every inch of comic book design has me fighting back tears."Sniff, it's beautiful man. Just beautiful."Vast in the digit of powers and tactics, the single-player is an experience of immersive frolic. Many people responded with a confounded, "huh," when I asked if they knew the existence of Freedom Force. Can anyone say, "sleeper hit." Hallmarks of the game siphons reality, and lets the boyish imaginings to roam free and putter with the infectious bounties of the game. Logging hours on the extensive single-player, the chance to shape your own characters, appearance, powers, and pick out an assortment of Marvel and DC skins, will have you brewing cup after cup of coffee. Now, to shut these blood-shot eyes. . .

Back in 2009, Ubisoft's "Just Dance" for the Wii introduced the concept of dance games using "real dance moves". It and its sequels were a huge success, selling over 10 million copies and counting. The game appealed to people on many levels. Individuals could play it to learn real dance moves and get a great workout. Families and friends could play it together and have fun with the choreographed routines. A year later in 2010, Microsoft introduced "Dance Central" for the Xbox. It brought to the table accurate full-body motion tracking of the Kinect and sold 2.5 million copies.In all this time the Playstation has been somewhat left out in the cold. Singstar Dance was an early attempt to cash in on the "real dance move" craze, but at the end of the day it was a karaoke title with dancing spliced in as an afterthought. "Everybody Dance" is Sony Computer Entertainment's long-overdue dive into the genre. And it's a pretty good one.As the game starts you need to set up the Move controller by pointing it at the screen. As with Just Dance, only one controller per player is used which you hold in your right hand. The system supports a maximum of two players.There are a couple menu options:Dance Now: Here, you can dive right into one of the 40 songs that the game comes with by selecting an album cover using your Move controller. Each song has an "energy level" indicator from 1 to 3. Since the Amazon listing doesn't have the song list as of the time of this writing, I'll list them here. They are:- Amerie - 1 Thing (2)- Barry White - You're the First, The Last, My Everything (1)- Basement Jaxx - Where's Your Head At (3)- Billy Idol with Generation - Dancing with Myself (3)- Bodyrockers - I Like The Way (2)- Carl Douglas - Kung Fu Fighting (1)- CeCe Peniston - Finally (1)- The Chemical Brothers - Hey Boy Hey Girl (2)- Chromeo - Night By Night (2)- Dam-Funk - Hood Pass Intact (1)- Deadmau5 - Ghosts 'N' Stuff feat. Bob Swire (2)- Diana Ross - Upside Down (2)- Duck Sauce - Barbara Streisand (2)- Elle Goulding - Starry Eyed (1)- Elton John - I'm Still Standing (3)- Fatboy Slim - Praise You (2)- Groove Armada - Superstylin' (2)- Ida Corr Vs Fedde Le Grand - Let Me Think About It (1)- Jay Sean featuring Lil Wayne - Down (1)- Kool and the Gang - Get Down On It (1)- Lady GaGa - Born This Way (3)- LMFAO - Party Rock Anthem (2)- M/A/R/R/S - Pump Up the Volume (3)- Miami Sound Machine - Dr Beat (3)- New Kids on the Block - You Got It (The Right Stuff  2)- Nicole Scherzinger - Don't Hold Your Breath (1)- Ok Go - Here It Goes Again (3)- OutKast - The Way You Move (1)- Puretone - Addicted to Bass (2)- Raphael Saadiq - Radio (2)- Republica - Ready to Go (3)- Rihanna - Rude Boy (1)- R. Kelly - Step In The Name Of Love (1)- SNAP! - The Power (3)- Sublime - Santeria (1)- Tiesto v Diplo feat Busta Rhymes - C'mon (Catch 'Em By Surprise  3)- Tinie Tempah - Pass Out (1)- Usher featuring Pitbull - DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love (2)- Usher featuring will.i.am - OMG (1)- Willow - Whip My Hair (2)Overall, I'd say the artist selection is "hipper" than Just Dance or Dance Central, the kind of set list you might see from a DJ in a club. This may be an advantage or a drawback depending on your musical tastes.Once you select a song, you can choose one of three levels: Beginner, Intermediate, and Professional. Beginner and Intermediate are about the difficulty of a typical song in Just Dance, with basic dance moves. Professional, on the other hand, adds things like complex movements, spins, jumps, and more expert-caliber choreography. Master any song at the Professional level, and you'll surely wow them at your next wedding or party.Finally, you can select a length of the song. "Normal" songs range around 3-5 minutes, while "Short" versions last about 1-2 minutes.Game play itself is fairly simple. As with all the other dance games, your goal is to match the on-screen dancer by mirroring his or her moves. While Just Dance has a silhouette to follow and Dance Central uses a hipster doofus cartoon character, Everybody Dance displays a real video image of a human dancer in a gray color. I personally prefer this, as it's easier to pinpoint the precise moves to follow. It's a nice touch that the video image looks like the artist, and the choreography does a great job of capturing the artist's style; in many cases, the moves mimic the same ones the artists perform in their video.The more accurate your moves are, the more points you'll rack up and you'll be awarded one to five stars at the end. You'll also be rewarded for "streaks" of contiguous successful moves. As with Just Dance, if you stand still and just wave your arms in the right way, you'll be able to rack up points. But of course, the fun in this game isn't in collecting points, it's in performing the real dance moves.As much as the game is derivative of previous dance games, there are a couple features in Everybody Dance that are truly innovative. While you're playing the game, you can watch the original artist's video playing in the background. Press the "triangle" button and it switches to a live video image of you. You'll even see a "trail of light" that shows your Move controller's motion. This feature is extremely useful when you're learning the dance moves, as you can precisely compare your body position and moves to the on-screen character's.Once the dance is over, you'll see your point total, number of stars, and longest streak. You'll also be able to view a 30 second video clip of your performance, as well as 10 snapshots that were taken during the performance of you in various poses. You have the option of saving them to the PS3 hard drive or posting them to Facebook or Twitter (and to the PS3 Community).By default, you dance in solo mode until a second player turns on their Move Controller. Once that's done, the menu changes to "Battle Mode", where you can compete against each other in any of the songs in Beginner, Intermediate, and Professional levels. Alternatively, you can also select "Dance Partners", where each player gets his or her own unique choreographed moves in a single dance routine. Bear in mind that for two players, you need at least 8-10 feet of space in front of the Playstation Eye so that both of you fit comfortably on the screen, and even then you may end up bumping into each other or hitting each other."Party" mode is another pretty cool innovation. It starts off by asking you to take pictures of each person who's participating, from 2 up to 20 people. Then, it'll pair two competitors at a time to a dance-off. The two selected dancers can choose a song, difficulty level, and song length to compete to. The rounds keep going until you stop, at which time you'll be shown the overall winner (based on number of songs won, awards won, and longest streaks), rankings, and the biggest rival.The "Dance Studio" menu offers three options: Dance Creator, Dance Class, and Dance Workout. "Dance Creator" lets you record and play your own routines, either solo or with a partner. You're shown a full-screen image of yourself (with the music video playing in the corner) and you basically record yourself dancing. You can then play your (or others') saved routines from the Dance Now, Party, or Dance Creator menus (complete with very accurate scoring)."Dance Class" is a great way to learn the dance moves, highly recommended for the "Professional" difficulty level. The system will break down the song into short sections of about 30 seconds each, and you loop through each section 4 times. Surprisingly, it took me only one or two times going through each section to master it for most songs, even at professional level.With "Dance Workout", you start out by setting up a new profile. You take your picture and set your weight using the Move Controller. Then, you select a pre-defined workout which consists of similar songs bundled together at different difficulty levels. Each workout consists of 3 songs and lasts about 10 minutes (Professional+ workouts consist of 5 songs and last 15-20 minutes). There are 12 workouts in total across the different difficulty levels.As you work out, a calorie meter is displayed on top of the screen showing you the target calories for each song. As long as you match the hand movements, you'll get credit for the calories, but of course to get a true workout you need to be "honest" and really do all the motions you're asked to do with your whole body.Choosing "Get More Songs" will quit the game and take you to the Playstation Store to download additional DLC. As of this writing (October 21, 2011) there were no songs available yet, but expect that to change very soon."Galleries" is where you can go to visit all your past saved performances, either ones you saved to your hard drive or uploaded. You can also visit the "Community Gallery" which shows the 30-second videos and photos that others around the world have uploaded. You can vote for videos you like which will help them rise in popularity. As of this writing the game has only been out for a few days, and yet there are already hundreds of videos out there, a few surprisingly good, most not so good. Some observations: men currently seem to outnumber women by a large margin, and grown men should *really* think twice before uploading a video of themselves dancing to Willow Smith's "Whip My Hair".You have the option of turning "singing" on and off. If you turn singing on, you can sing into the Playstation Eye microphone, or into a USB microphone or wireless headset. After each song you'll get a "singing rating", but that's about it--it doesn't even record your performance.Everybody Dance is an interesting game to rate, mainly because it naturally leads to comparisons with the games that came before it. I'd say from a "pure fun" perspective, Just Dance still holds the advantage. From a "motion detection accuracy" perspective, Dance Central's full body tracking is arguably superior than the Wii or the PS3's "one-handed solution" for these kinds of games. If you come with pre-set expectations from either of those games, you might be disappointed.Having said that, Everybody Dance does do both of those things pretty well, and is an excellent game on its own merits. The innovations that Sony brought to the table, including more advanced choreography in original artist's own style, the community features, the accuracy of the "Dance Creator" (which is definitely superior to the same feature on Just Dance for the Kinect), and the ability to dance side-by-side with the on-screen character all catapult Everybody Dance into the same echelon as those games. And of course it is easily the best dancing game available for the Playstation Move right now.
I have to admit I have been a skeptic of the Singstar franchise. With game after game on the PS2 it didn't really anything I was ever interested in. Now with it's new life on the PS3 it is a whole other game. Singstar is without a doubt the best party game available right now on the PS3. It is also a prime example of how much fun community gaming can be.From the minute you pop the disc in it's simple to navigate the menu. You esentially have three options. Play Singstar, view gallery, and online. I am going to cover each option so that you can understand how much fun this game is.Playing Singstar gives you a choice of thirty songs to croon over. The thirty songs are a mix of pop, r&b;, and rock. Sorry country fans, your not going to find any of your favorite songs on this disc. Although you only get 30 songs to chooose from there are well over 200 available on the Singstore. More on that later. Now with Singstar you can just have a solo performance or if you have your friends around there are plenty more options. You can actually have contests with up to eight people. The possibilities are really endless. With multiplayer you can either perform a duet or battle others. There are specific songs for duet although every song will let you perform a duet. With a battle you can take on others to try and get the highest score. With the performances they are scored on a scale of 0 to 10,000. There are also difficulty levels if you want more of a challenge. The object is rather simple: Sing at the same tone as the artists. As you sing you really have to make sure you can keep the same level as the musician. On easy it's rather simple to get a good score. Upping the difficulty level makes it that much more difficult. What makes the performances memorable is that you can record your vocals. Now if your voice is or isn't very good you can adjust microphone level. What makes Singstar magic is having a USB camera that is compatible with the PS3 or a PS Eye. The camera will record a 25 second video of you belting out your greatest. You can even take the artists voice out of the songs. Of course I wouldn't advise anyone to do this unless they have a good voice. Now the audio clips, videos, and even snapshots the camera will take go into your gallery.Now the gallery is what stores your best or worst performances. From here you can let other people see your performance at home. The gallery will store numerous videos, audio clips, and pics. What makes the gallery truly a gallery is that you can upload any of these things online to the Singstar interface.Online is what takes this game to the next level. The Singstore is what the PSN should be. Immediately you get to choose from over 200 more songs that are available in the store. Each song sells for $1.49 and comes with the video. Not a bad price for some good fun. The Singstore will update with songs every other week. SONY is promising 25 to 50 songs a month. The artists cover a wide array of music genres dating back to the 1960's to songs that have just been released. I have already found myself downloading numerous songs I enjoy. The new music will keep this game fresh for quite a few months if not years.The most amazing feature is the Singstar Online feature. From the main menu you can set up your profile listing your favorite song and musician. You can also have a picture taken from your USB camera. From your profile you can also view messages people leave you and check your uploaded videos to see if people are giving you good scores. You can also access other players. Set up like Youtube you can watch players from all around the world perform their best. The interface allows you to watch videos that have just been uploaded. You can also check out featured performances for the week. These are the higher scoring songs. And lastly they have a hall of fame featuring the highest rated most viewed performances. You can score any performance from 1 to 5 stars and even leave comments to the performer. If you really like someones performance there is an easy way to access your friends list and mailbox and request a person to be on your friends list. I have seen some stellar performances and I have also seen your very creative performance. This is a definite incentive to try and make something interesting for everyone to see. All in all this is what I enjoy most about the game.If I were to sum up Singstar I would say it's an experience everyone should try. It's fun, a lot of fun. It's a great break from other gaming experiences and it's a good way to invite people over to do some karoke. I think that most who enjoy to sing in the shower or car should purchase this game. Those who have enjoyed it on the PS2 should enjoy it even more on the PS3. Have fun and try to become a Singstar...

From your profile you can also view messages people leave you and check your uploaded videos to see if people are giving you good scores.  You can also access other players.  Set up like Youtube you can watch players from all around the world perform their best.  The interface allows you to watch videos that have just been uploaded.  You can also check out featured performances for the week.  These are the higher scoring songs.  And lastly they have a hall of fame featuring the highest rated most viewed performances.  You can score any performance from 1 to 5 stars and even leave comments to the performer.  If you really like someones performance there is an easy way to access your friends list and mailbox and request a person to be on your friends list. I have seen some stellar performances and I have also seen your very creative performance.  This is a definite incentive to try and make something interesting for everyone to see.  All in all this is what I enjoy most about the game.If I were to sum up Singstar I would say it's an experience everyone should try.  It's fun, a lot of fun.  It's a great break from other gaming experiences and it's a good way to invite people over to do some karoke.  I think that most who enjoy to sing in the shower or car should purchase this game.  Those who have enjoyed it on the PS2 should enjoy it even more on the PS3.  Have fun and try to become a Singstar...
Music games have come so far since the original Guitar Hero hit the PS2. Four years ago, we tolerated questionable covers of some of our favorite songs, and even as more music labels started lending their talent to the plastic instrument titans, a handful of classic bands remained unattainable. We had the Stones and Dylan, but there was no way we'd ever see Zeppelin, Pink Floyd or the Beatles, right? Well, still no luck on those first two, but after some cajoling and (likely) a proverbial dump truck full of money, Harmonix somehow booked the Fab Four for their first video game tour in The Beatles Rock Band.Of course, The Beatles Rock Band is not the first band-centric music game in recent years. Metallica, Aerosmith and Van Halen have all received star treatment from competitor Guitar Hero, while Harmonix did release a pricy AC/DC disc last year as a Wal-Mart exclusive. But for The Beatles --arguably the most popular band in modern history - the developer suggested that a major overhaul was in order. And while the results may no necessarily live up to that initial announcement, baby-boomer Beatles devotees and hardcore plastic rockers should both be thrilled with the game.If you've seen screenshots or that surreal Abbey Road commercial, you know by now that the core game doesn't deviate much from the scrolling tracks layout established previously in the genre. And though The Beatles Rock Band does encourage the (much ballyhooed) harmonies, my family, friends and I were often too tone-deaf to really put this feature to use. But while the controls remain tried-and-true, it's the presentation that truly makes this collaboration a success.While the first two Rock Band games were always stylistically more dynamic than Guitar Hero thanks to numerous visual filters, this Beatles edition's attention to detail and psychedelic backgrounds raise the bar even higher. Shea Stadium and the Ed Sullivan set have been recreated beautifully, while the Abbey Road sojourns offer trippy music videos for the studio songs never performed live. Many of the latter transport the band outside of the studio completely. (You'll ride aboard the titular vehicle for "Yellow Submarine," for instance.)This visual fidelity means that the customization options had to be sacrificed. This is a worthy tradeoff, as it allows Harmonix to show how the band's costumes and style evolved along with their music. Seeing them get from their early 60s mop-top/suit getup to the bearded rooftop veterans just prior to their split is truly remarkable. And assuming that you're playing the 45 songs in the order recommended for the story mode, you'll see plenty of supplementary photos and archival video snippets to back up the artistic direction.As for the actual track list, many reviewers have already expressed frustration at the small song list. I, too, wish that "Strawberry Fields," "Norwegian Wood" and several others hadn't been omitted, but at least 44 of the songs are truly wonderful, with the early cover of "Boys" as the only oddity. Tracks like "Within You Without You" and the downloadable "All You Need is Love" show that sitars and string orchestras can be adapted to the plastic instruments as well, so songs like "Eleanor Rigby" are possible in the future.For many of you, the opposite may be true - you're so sick of band games that even The Beatles aren't enough to lure you back. If you fall into this camp, I'd urge you to still give this Rock Band a shot. The music is so joyous, the presentation so impeccable, that you may find yourself hooked all over again.--Reviewed by Justin Hemenway
This is going to be a slightly strange review since the obvious idea with this game is to either introduce you to the Beatles or it's a full-blown tribute to what you can't argue is one of the most influential bands ever. And yet, I'm only a small fan, not this massive worshipper that can sing all their songs and there's some songs that to be honest, I don't care for. But while there's still a couple of those, I find the more I was playing through the story, the more a lot of the music opened up but for those of you wondering, this is strictly a Beatles release, unlike the band-centered Guitar Hero games, Beatle and only Beatle music are on this so nothing as far as solo careers and the like (too bad, no "Imagine" or anything from Wings) with further album DLC's on the way but if you are a massive Beatle fan, this will instantly attract you to it.Story: Well there is a "story mode" but essentially it starts with the band playing at the Cavern Club and from there they move onto the Ed Sullivan Show, Shea Stadium and finally end at their rooftop appearance on the Apple Corp. building. In the middle of these is their psychedelic period where they were messing around in studio, only the song has been given the visual treat of a "Dreamscape" which is unique to each song, some are pure 60's LSD kaleidoscope-influenced whereas others you get some very simple-yet-beautiful hilltops and flower gardens.Graphics: What makes Beatles Rock Band work is its extraordinary attention to detail and I'm not just talking about band members looking like their real-life counterparts but also their specific appearances at certain times such as Paul's beard and John's hair on the Apple Corp building (though the beard looks odd and John's hair looks more like dreadlocks than long hair). The dreamscapes in all their variety look stunning and there can be some really trippy stuff but also there's some fashion on the crowds and fans that match up and the intro to the Ed Sullivan show appearances have passerbys watching the show on store window televisions. It's certainly better than the realistic meeting the cartoonish avatars in Guitar Hero 5 anyway.Sound/Music: Now obviously this is going to be the biggest portion of the game and to real let the sound spectrum go nuts, listen to the psychedelic stuff since some of that stuff can get...bizarre. But the music is the star here and everything from the straightforward "Ticket to Ride" (my favorite) to the indescribable "I Am the Walrus", a lot has been included here. Also added are some audio clips of the band either in the studio or just clips of them in concert (even the closing credits of the story is one long take of the band chatting in studio). What made disappoint and it certainly does for me is not what was in but rather what's not in as far as song choices. I love "We Can Work it Out", it's not here. "Across the Universe", "Blackbird", "Penny Lane", "Strawberry Fields Forever", "I've Just Seen a Face", "Hey Jude", "Happiness is a Warm Gun" and I'm sure several others are missing in action and while I hope they're DLC eventually, with the announced album DLC's of Sgt Peppers, Rubber Soul and Abbey Road, those songs might still be a long way off.Gameplay: Pretty much the same as any Rock Band or Guitar Hero release. Notes will appear on a highway and you're to strum and hold the correct colored fret to advance, and if your a drummer, this includes using the foot pedal and the 4-pad drum kit. Songs range in difficulty from easy to expert and I'll admit, some songs on expert can be kind of surprising. Riff's perfectly fine, easy enough to handle than it's like whoosh! big solo with tons of hammer-on's. It's not like playing say Metallica songs where you know your fingers are going to get a workout soon, there's songs here that I didn't even know were to go crazy. Also, some songs barely feature the guitar so you might even find yourself strumming the parts from a Rhodes piano or the string section. People might lament the fact that barring a few tricky sections, the game is relatively easy, especially if you're a Guitar Hero nut (or even a Dragonforce fan...for some reason) but that also makes the game really easy to get into. And with the no-fail option from Rock Band 2 available, it's very easy to get a party going and not berating your aunt cause she can't get the riff to "Day Tripper" on easy right.For the collector in you, we have photos of the band that are unlocked when you meet certain requirements (those being 3-star a song, 5-star a song, complete a venue in story mode or collect a certain amount of photos which nets you a cool little prize). What's nice about these is that they're not tied to a specific instrument or difficulty so you might go through the story mode changing from guitar to bass like I did but you'll still get your photos rather than "sorry, you started as guitar, you finish guitar if you want these photos"). A benefit to these for Beatle fans is that checking them out gets you some info about the photo with factchecker Paul McCartney himself verifying it. And like I said, there's some studio chatter and live recordings of the band during the song loading and when the song's finished so you're practically surrounded by all sides of Beatle stuff.One thing I have to mention though: this game's tracks can NOT be transferred to Rock Band 1 or 2 thanks to the dreamscapes of the songs but also the new 3-part harmony tracks for the vocals so they're pulling an Activision here and not allowing cross-combatibility but whereas Activision just did it for the cash (I'm sure GH Metallica and Aerosmith and even Smash Hits could be DLC), it makes sense for the Beatles Rock Band game but be warned that for those you want a massive setlist on one game that combines all DLC from RB1/2 and this are out of luck. Obviously the benefit is that the instruments from the games will work on this so whereas you can't take new DLC track "All You Need is Love" into Rock Band 2, at least the instruments for it will work.Like I said, I'm not this massive fan of the band but there's a lot of songs that I do like so I don't know how this game will work on new people (if there is any left anyway) but for Beatle fans, this is obviously a purchase and you've probably already bought it already along with the remastered CD's (available in both remastered and original box sets too) and while the story mode is short with the achievement for beating the story mode in 24 hours is a joke....4 hours maybe, if that and there's only 45 songs with of course the omissions I mentioned but at least the music that is here is timeless.
I have never tried the first version, Boogie, which didn't get great ratings.  However, I can tell that this version is much better already.The music is obviously targeted at the younger generation with the Top 40 type of music, as opposed to the oldies but goodies of American Idol 1 (not sure about AI 2 yet).  The genres are pop, urban, and electrodance.  When you play more often, more songs are unlocked at higher difficulties.  Additional songs cannot be downloaded through Wi-Fi, which I heard is a new option for American Idol 2.  By the way, my unlocked music is only available for me under my character, while others still have to work at getting more songs to reach the same level.The music plays at one speed, so I did feel some frustration at the beginning when the lyrics flew across the TV screen.  The song words scroll from left to right for both Boogie Super Star and American Idol, while Guitar Hero offers a second option when the lyrics are shown in static mode, meaning one line at a time, which I have found easier to follow.  If your eyes are quick, then it's fairly easy to read the lyrics as opposed to the small jammed up font in Guitar Hero.You have the option to play up to 3 songs per set.First, select the activity type: dance one at a time, dance side-by-side, sing one at a time, or sing a duet (passing the mic back and forth, which I found hard to do).Second, decide if you want the song to be random (by the Wii) or selectable (by you).Although you have set this all up, the game stops in between songs if you decided to select your own music (and take a quick water break for your worn out throat).  It does not give you the option to select 6 songs upfront like it does in Guitar Hero for continuous fun.All of the games mentioned here do not take advantage of your personal Mii character, except for Guitar Hero's side activity of creating your own band.  The graphics are more cartoon-y, if you will, as opposed to American Idol which is trying to look realistic.  There are 2 male and 3-4 female characters (can't recall the exact number right now), from which to choose for the general look.  After that, you can change the skin color, hair color, add tattoos and accessories, switch clothes and shoes, but most of it is "locked" until you have earned enough points.The microphone is the same for Boogie Super Star, American Idol and Guitar Hero World Tour, so if you own those, you don't have to buy the bundle and save yourself 7 bucks or so.  Unfortunately, the duet in this game only uses 1 microphone so you have to learn to share and be quick in passing it back and forth.  So I prefer to go head-to-head by singing solos (one player sings after the other).  For 2 players, both must dance or both must sing.  There is no option for one person to sign and the other dance.  The game is rated for 4 players, but I have yet to find enough courageous people.  The limitation of one microphone for duets is the biggest con in my opinion, which is not necessarily a show stopper.  Although the cord length was not an issue, I do wish the that the microphone was cordless (everything else is!).  I decided to buy a mic stand, so that I can be hands free, especially when I try to play guitar for Guitar Hero (double the challenge!).Each player needs a remote for the dance competition, no mic and no nunchuck.  Yes, you really only need to dance with one hand, the hand holding the remote.  The Wii does not know what you are doing with your lower body.  It was funny to watch my brother compete with me, standing there with only one hand moving, while I'm truly trying to boogie with arms, legs, booty, and all.  With that said, if you put your energy into it, Boogie Super Star does get you off the couch so you can burn some calories if you do it long enough.This game is good for people who like to sing in the shower as well as the karaoke super stars.  Boogie Super Star offers the extra element of dancing, while American Idol focuses on singing.  This game also works for people who want to learn some coordination in the privacy of their own home before taking over the dance floor at a local club.  Ok, ok, ok, the dance moves in Boogie Super Star don't quite translate to real life dancing, but it still does teach you how to stay on beat.  The Wii can tell if you are doing the "Eagle" dance move on tempo (there's a tempo meter which tells you to speed up or slow down).  There are 4 basic dance moves and 4 special moves per genre, which come to a total of 16.  There are also "combos", which are self-explanatory.  Don't worry, a "dance guide" poster is included with the game, which was more helpful than the instructional manual.  For more advanced skills, you'll have to attend professional dance classes.  I do think it will be quite hilarious if and when I recognize someone using the Boogie Super Star dance moves in real life at a dance club!There is a dance "academy" feature.  You can record your own routine and save it, then use it later during a competition.  I found this quite amusing actually when you see your character (you) replay.  You really need to know the dance moves by heart at this point to make up a decent routine.  Have no fear for the 2-left footed folk, there is a training section.  You can learn one dance move at a time and you keep doing it until you have been on tempo (green light) for a set time.This game is not for serious singing and dancing as opposed to other games, such as American Idol and Dancing with the Stars.  There are also 3 judges like that in American Idol, but their commentary is very short and sweet 1-2 liners and can be skipped by pressing the A button.  For real-life examples, there are several homemade videos on YouTube if you want to see some people in action.  But I find it much more fun and amusing when YOU are the Boogie Super Star!  Bottom line: Yes, I'd buy it again.
When it has came down to classic rock music, nobody has ranked as higher than The Beatles. yet, even with the fact that it has been nearly 40 years since the Fab Four broke up, and went their seperate ways, their music has still been one of the deepest cornerstones of pop culture you could even imagine. While it is so sad that John Lennon and George Harrison aren't here to celebrate the groups' catalog re-releases, the feeling of John, Paul, George, and Ringo have reached a whole new era of fans that still remains as timeless as ever. Now, that has also reached the field of video games as well, with the help of Rock Band. It has been a big gamble to bring the music and iconic influence of The Beatles to turn them into modern day video game icons, to a generation that chooses to get their music through MP3's, rather than the full-length records from start to finish. Well, can The Beatles rock out loud again? Well, they are still the eggman, they honestly the walrus.The Beatles: Rock Band brings in a new generation of video game lovers to the influence of what has made the iconic influence of what The Beatles brought into the spotlight, is a huge treat for video game lovers and hard core fans of what made The Beatles stand out, even 45 years after they made their first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. The graphics are really amazing, and range from the simplicity of the rooftops of their Apple Records label, to the spotlight of the old Mets' Shea Stadium heart and soul. The gameplay is addictive for hard core Beatles fans, as they play their way through The Beatles' biggest songs including She Loves You, Get Back, I Wanna Hold Your Hand, as well as I Am The Walrus, as well as other surprises like Dig A Pony, and Tax Man. There also are great unlockables for the hard core Beatles fan, including very rare footage from The Fab Four's biggest moments, to moments in the recording studio with the group, you can not get anywhere else. The gameplay is absolutely addictive for anyone young or old whom hasn't even yet known what The Beatles experience was like in the 60's, and at the beginning of the 70's. The control is also easy to master for anyone whom has enjoyed Rock Band before, but challenging from top to bottom.All in all, The Beatles: Rock Band is absolutely a treat for hard core Beatles fans', and one of the most delightful games you could honestly imagine. While I honestly did wish that there could've been a few tracks from their Beatles' solo works as well, which could've brought in a bit more fun. But nevertheless, this is a great way to enjoy The Beatles experience if you are a video game lover heart and soul. If you had to choose between Guitar Hero 5, and The Beatles: Rock Band, I really suggest you say Hey Jude and Hello Goodbye to The Fab Four.Graphics: A-Sound: A-Control: B+Fun & Enjoyment: B 1/2+ for solo players; A- for multiplayerOverall: B+
Amplitude is a music game which is unique in the fact that it uses songs from established artists - some you most certainly have heard.  If you are familiar with music games you would be at home here - the music plays and you perform a part by "playing" the controller while the "music" moves by on the screen.  It is the sequel to a game called Frequency and some of this review compares this game to that one.The game also allows you to remix songs but I did not get into that on Frequency and again fail to find it enjoyable.  Also the head-to-head mode of this game is kind of strange - the single player is much more enjoyable in my opinion.One of the best parts about Frequency was getting introduced to groups I hadn't heard before and hopefully some of these artists will turn out the same.  The music in Amplitude is a mix of familiar and unfamiliar artists.  Strangely it seems to be harder to play the songs that I know (Weezer - Dope Nose or Blink 182 - Rock Show) than songs I haven't heard before.  Some of my favorite songs on Amplitude are Baseline by Quarashi, Cherry Libs by Garbage, and Urban Tumbleweed by the Baldwin Brothers.  Ultimately I feel like somehow these artists were picked to promote them for Sony - I wish there were more variety of tracks.Amplitude is easier to beat than Frequency was - there are 4 difficult modes (Mellow, Normal, Brutal, and Insane) and I started on Brutal when I first got it and played through in about 2 1/2 hours.  The expert mode of Frequency was much more difficult.  Easy mode is easy enough for my 6 year old to play.I would have been happy with the Frequency base game with new music - what Sony needs to do in the future is modify this game with new music every 3 to 6 months and rerelease it for $20 or so.  Much of the effort in the sequel seems to have gone into the system that allows you to create your own "guy" and as you play you unlock new clothes - whatever.  Your guy sort of plays along with you - if you are on a guitar track he plays guitar and when you play drums he switches to drums.A final word about the music.  I love 4-letter words in my music as much as anybody but while I enjoyed playing Frequency with my kids, some of the songs in Amplitude have bleeped out words and are about mature subjects - and some words that in my opinion should be bleeped aren't.

Ok, u play as two main characters, Darc and Kharg. Both are half human half deimos(civilized monsters). Darc grew up as deimos(called a deimos wannabe cuz he looks deimos/human) and Kharg grew up a noble, royal, human(looks all human). Humans and deimos realllllly hate eahc other. So u know theres gonna be conflict between the two. Oh and theres 5 magical stones that when collected gives u ultimate power and theres an evil bad guy with a huge empire collecting them. And u have to stop(as both characters) and save ur ho(ho of both characters).Now, gameplay. I really liked the gameplay, it is final fantasy tactics kinda except very much improved and not nearley as hard. U takes turns moving and each character has a highlighted space and u can move all over it until u take an action(item, attack,magic,special move). U can also position arrow fighters so they hit two or three enemys at a time. Now this is not the easiest game in the world. I died plenty of non-boss battles. I didnt finish it cuz it was rented from blockbuster and i had to return it after only thirty hours of gameplay(i was almost done). So if u dont do side missions,like me, and u play rpgs a lot u can finish this game in maybe 35 hours.So after all this positive stuff why the 4? I returned the game today and for the life of me i cant remember half of the characters names. Theres a big guy with an ax....ohhh ganz...theres a wolfish deimos..i remember maru, he and darc were probaly the best characters. Maru is this lost prince/theif with an arrow, he loooks like a jungle boy or something. Theres a character thats khargs best friend and oh my god, she is TIFA. I swear. She is tifas(ff7)exact character. Same personality, she obviously likes the main character, shes a good girl but not as much as lilia....which reminds me of...AERIS(ff7)....after awhile ull forget about this game. I didnt have a memorable feeling to it, and its best characters could be compared to final fantasys weakest characters. I like the setting, I like the game. I just dont think Id ever want to play it again or care if i finish.

This game is cool beacuse u can go to a level that where your driving around on a 4 wheeler while the forest is burning and there some mud and alot of water. You can get cool 4 wheelers but the bad thing is that the best 4 wheeleru can buy is like alot lot like 755 thousand credits i tihnk i dunno but its alot and itll take me a while even tho i finshed alot of races and alot of freestyle levels im not even close to enough to buy the best 4 wheeler in the game. Overall its the best 4 wheeleing game ive ever played. There are plenty of levels in carrer mode. The races arent too hard. You have a large choice of mufflers, 4 wheelers, gloves, suites, gogles, tires, mini games and many more. In freeride there are cool levels theres ones where your at an army base theres another where your all around puddles and alot more amazing inviorments. Most of all THERE ARE PLENTY OF JUMPS. There are good songs. The only thing i didnt like was the graphics when your in the menu but the graphics when your racing and stuff are amazing. its not to hard to bust out tricks. I'd reccomend this game for a person into racing and exitment. Another thing is is that its not realy good for a person just buying a playstation 2 but overall one of the best games ive play on playstation 2.

I never played Dark Cloud, and my friend said that game was dumb, so I decided not to.  He said I should play Dark Cloud 2, I was like ooo k.

And This game is definitly one of the best games of the year, but I just got the wind waker and have to say, Dark Cloud 2 is close but not there yet.  Well if u love RPGs, you'll love this, but if u have a gamecube and had trouble choosing, I'd have to with the wind waker, but hey, this is a real good game no doubt, and I recomend it to any fan of RPGs and adventure games

This is one of my few gripes.When your out on the streets in my favorite car (the infernus) and ur goin about ur own buisness and get attacked,the cops go right by as if nothing is going on.If you attack back well the cops are gunna moon you to death.Thats my only gripe, now im going to be psycho like all the others.THIS GAME KICKS!!!! GREAT GRAPHICS SOOOO MANY CARS TO GET!!! This doesnt even need the cheats to make it good.You can have enough fun in the first town without doing any missions to make you grieve that you could plays this all the time.I WISH this had multiplayer.But what it lacks it makes up in with choices.You can go onto dump st. and still find all the cars u need. This game the bums arent really bums in my thoughts.I mean could a bum afford 20 Fire Blast Grenades or when u kill them they drop like $200 bucks?Only cheat i always like to have is the improved car handling.Be very careful, this thing is so addictive that if a kid had the time and was allowed the time, he/she would be on it for 2 months rarely going to sleep.After you complete the first 2 cities it gets VERY easy.The ending of this [is] bad though.I kind of kick myself for going to rescue the chick in the last mission and then when your walking with her taking her home shes jabbering nonstop and then saying about her hair gunna cost like 50 bucks to put it back and then you here the gunshot and silence,i wasted 2 days tryen to rescue her and died 9 times for her.Punk teenager.If you dont know them ill put it a few cheats......Health=R2 R2 L1 R1 left down right up left down right up.thats all im putting cause its 1 am and i wanna go to bed. But this game is very confusing at some points like in the beggining, you dunno what the [heck] is going on. Well it is kinda fun somtimes to get in the boat and shoot on the road and have cops coming and falling in the water.A few twitches,overall,very good game!WARNING:NOT INTENDED FOR CHILD'S USE THIS GAME CAN PERSUADE THEM TO WANT TO DO THIS IN THEIR LIVES.SHOULD BE AT LEAST 14 TO PLAY THIS.IF UNDER THIS AGE AND U LET UR CHILD PLAY, ID WORRY ABOUT THEIR FUTURE!!!!

i had just got this game a couple of hours ago and ill tell you im pretty frustrated with the controls (for now) online ill tell you plays in a mix of SOCOM 3 and SOCOM II. the single player is weird though. you get one guy to help you. basically your bizatch. the controls are alot to work with since no button on this game is untouch. i think they did a great job with the controls with the lack of one analog stick. if any of you are complaining about lock on, well id say its no problem. in order to lock on to you targets you have to be pretty close to your enemies. the controls are pretty awkward youll be pressing freelook. freelook lets you move your crosshairs around to aim at targets and if you hold L while in freelook. you move forward but it gets annoying and aches your hands when you do so. at this point i dont know which one is more comftable to me and i dont know which one i should be using more often. since im already use to the buttons, freelook would be most helpful when your walking in a big wide open field because the crosshair is aimed up and you wont be seeing the things that are knee high, they could have fixed the camera angles a big cuz when you switch from freelook to normal the crosshair moves back to its default position which is upwards. sniping is pretty good in this game. you can lock on with it and use it like a automatic but the accuracy will be pretty bad so what you will want to do is lock on then go to scope mode to snipe him. the levels are a little smaller than from socom 2 id say about 20%. but id say for 40$ its pretty good. the graphics are pretty average, they look like a watered down socom 1 but to me it doesnt really bother me at all. funny thing is that the accuracy is heavly affected when your running now, i was shooting someone while running online and most of my bullets flew off. one thing that i really liked online was that there is voice communication. the game requires a sepereate headset that sony provides for 20 bucks and you plug it into the headphone jack. the thing about this is that even if you  dont have a headset. and another guy does and if he is talking to you, his voice projects right out of the speakers of your psp. isnt that cool. when you register a name, if your name is the same like you used for socom 3, and you are registered, your friends list is shown with all the people that you added and will show if they are on or not, matter of fact that could also see you if your online. if you are using the same name that your are registered for socom 3 and fireteam bravo, the friends list will show up for who you added for socom 3 and you could see if they are online. the people on socom 3 can even message you while your on fireteam bravo.id say for $40 its very much worth it. if you guys are getting it for the unlockables id say its not really worth it if your not gonna be getting it for the extras. but the game  itself is really a great game even with everyone saying "o its a handheld game your better off playing your ps2. id advice anyone who likes socom and like it as a handheld to get this game. you will definetely be amazed on how nice it is. most of you will be saying on how its just like socom for the ps2

Sim-ers have always wanted pets. The additions of fish and hamsters were rather unsatisfying (and sometimes lethal) additions. This new expansion packs will allow your sims to have dogs, cats, parrots, turtles and lizards as well.Lots of new social interactions have been added, althought the Sims website has not been specific as to what those are. Your neighborhoods are bigger - 30 lots each which you can zone for commerical or residential use.  Also there are new homes, new parks, a new cafe, new shops and a farmer's market! Your new dog or cat can be brought to these locales and used to interact with your sim neighbors.  Just like in Downtown, time freezes when you're in the community sections.Each neighborhood will include a pet store, where you can choose from 12 different cats (e.g., black cat and siamese cat), 12 different dogs (e.g., dalmatians, beagles, french bulldogs, spaniels, rotweillers, labs, greyhounds, german shepherds to name a few), 2 different birds (lovebirds and parakeets), or buy a turtle, lizard or fish.  The Maxis folks haven't forgotten any of the details of pets, if you buy a male and a female of the same species, they just might have babies, dogs and cats (and dog and cat people) might not get along, and Kitty might take a liking to your bird or fishBeware - your doggies and kitties (but not the other animals) need to be trained and cared for so they don't go to the bathroom in the house or rip us the trash.  Don't worry - Maxis is kind enough to provide a dog trainer if you're feeling lazy. But, your pets are just like a member of your family - they will have needs and skills which can be acquired (through positive and negative reinforcement). Just like people, you have to develop a relationship with them.  And just like your people, they can die of neglect, so be careful!  Dogs and cats will also misbehave and get grumpy if you don't take care of them.  Dogs and cats can also be entered in pet shows with prizes for obedience, tricks and good pet mood.  You can't bring your pets downtown (although you can probably pick up a date in the pet park) but your whole family (including your pet) goes on vacation with you.There's new stuff for your house too - you can can garden! Grow 4 different veggies in your patch (you have to buy seeds), careful gardening will result in a crop which you can sell (at the farmer's market) or store (in your new kitchen pantry). You might appreciate your pets here as you'll need to watch out for rabbits, gophers, mice and, as Maxis says ominously, other "unwelcome animals that come a callin'." (Mice, which your cat can keep away, will join roaches as house pets.) There will be 125 new objects for you and your pets (no details on those yet either), a new decorator set (New Orleans French Quarter), new skins and 5 new career tracks (fashion design, chef, vet, teacher, circus performer).  Among the new objects are new chairs, new tables, new fountains, espresso machine, pastry cart, spiral staircase, and pet-oriented objects like food bowls, catnip, dog beds, treats, squeak toys, doghouses, pet gyms, chew toys, and scratching posts.

As was the case with the original Sims, Sims 2 proves to be a great hit, and a highly addictive game for many.Over the original Sims-PROS:Building: houses can be more than 2 stories, and have decks.Growth: children go through various stages of development and growth. How well you raise them, and how well their individual needs are met can affect how they grow up.Aging: although many people turn this feature off, I enjoy playing with aging turned on. Sims needs and desires change over time. After they turn into an elder, they collect retirement money from their job.For Hire: parents can now hire a nanny to "raise" the children while they are at work, which means social services won't come take the crying baby away if he/she is accidentally left at home. Nanny is especially helpful for when children are babies. Not a good idea to utilize them a lot when baby turns to a toddler, as the nanny will only, at best, take care of the child's most basic needs. Nanny will not teach the child to walk, talk or use the potty. And speaking of the potty- nanny will often not flush after she goes. eww!Love bed: Sims can do 'woohoo' in any 2-person bed, or hot tub. They can also do woohoo in public places, such as a dressing room. If your sim is love-oriented, they will desire to do this often. Sims can also choose to woohoo or try to conceive a baby. This means that yuppy sims with nice jobs can get lots of action, without the responsibility of having a child.Love is a social disease: Sims can meet social needs by chatting online or on the phone.Party Hardy: Sims can now throw specialized parties, such as house party, birthday party, and wedding. Specific items for each occasion can be purchased, such as wedding or birthday cake, a wedding arbor to get married under. Sims can pop the bubbly and toast to other sims. When wedding or birthday cake is cut, the sims gather round' and celebrate. Note: if you have the plasma TV, get rid of it during parties, or all your guests will head right towards it, and will spend a large chunk of time watching it.Hot for Teacher: Sims with a school-aged child can invite the headmaster over for dinner. If your house and food is high enough caliber, your child will be allowed to get in. If you have any furnishings in your yard that shouldn't be there (beds, etc) or the love tub, the headmaster will leave immediately, even if your home is otherwise expensively decorated and furnished. Getting into private school is important, and the better education will supposedly help your sims grow up better.CONS:Object rotation: this is far worse in Sims 2. Often, windows which are placed while viewing the home from the outside front, are placed backwards. Rotation is near impossible at times. Frustrating! Rotation was much easier in the original Sims.Repairing: it seems like things in my home break every single day. Toilets clog daily, even though my sims are clean and always flush. I usually have the repair guy out every day.Homework: Sim children have homework. The downside is that if they don't do their homework, their grades suffer. An even larger downside is that your sim children will drop their homework anywhere in the house, and finding it can sometimes be difficult. I've tried placing desks near the front door, but they always leave it on the floor.The Dingo ate my baby: As is the case with homework, the baby is often misplaced. Members of the family will often set the baby down on the floor and walk away. They will do this a lot in the kitchen, after bottle feeding. The kitchen cabinets and table can make it difficult to see where the baby is. If you "lose" your baby, then simply click on the crib, and tell you sim to place the baby in the crib. They will go and get the baby from whatever location it is in.Also, many of my sims "argue" over the baby, making carrying out tasks with baby to be frustrating. I can have my mom sim feeding the baby, after she's done, she will set baby down for a moment, before picking him up to go change his diaper. In that moment, 1-3 other sims will come over, all with the intent of taking the baby. I've had to fight over babies more times than I want to think about.I'm with stupid: my sims are so incredibly stupid sometimes. Even with free will turned on, they will stand there crying and whimpering because their 'fun' meter is completely red. Instead of going and watching TV or playing computer....they pace the house crying, or talk to other sims. They also will often cook for only themselves, even though they're a parent to 5 children. A family-minded sim should cook and serve family meals most of the time, not just make themselves a bowl of mac and cheese.Second verse, same as the first: Unfortunately, EA didn't change furnishings as much as most sims fanatics would have liked. Although most furnishings have multiple colors of the same items, we have very few choices. If you want a high-comfort couch, you only have 2-3 styles to choose from. Same with beds, chairs, etc. I like to play the game to build and furnish an interesting house. If I want my sims to be comfortable, I only have a few furniture choices.Grow up already: Sims can bring a friend home from school (randomly game-generated) or meet other sims that don't live in their neighborhood. In one case, my sim teen fell deeply in love with another sim. She could call and invite him over, but eventually, she grew into an adult. Since the boy did not live in her neighborhood, I could not play as him and allow him to age, which meant their now adult/child relationship was immediately turned into a platonic one.Teen Love: Teenagers can kiss, hug, and make out, but not have teen sex. Why not? Teen pregnancy could have been an interesting stir-up for this game. Also, why not throw in some STDs. Little Sally Sim may get straight A's in school, but we all know she'd love to bang the entire football team. She could pick up herpes, and lose some body or health points. Stir it up, EA!!BUGS:I have no add-ons, downloads or anything in this game other than what came on the EA CD. I never had any problems with this game, until I downloaded EA's latest update. Big mistake. Since then:Bubble butt: my sims will occasionally get bubble coming out of their rear-ends after swimming. The only thing that seems to resolve this, is if they go swimming again.Swing low: the headmaster will occasionally get sidetracked while at the house, and will spend hours on the swingset. It's near impossible to get him off of it, and get him to eat and tour the house.The sound of music: I'll occasionally get repeating sound issues, and the game has to be shut down to fix this. Very annoying.Eternal Sleep: A sleeping sim will often stay in bed for hours and hours after their sleep bar is full. Even if they're hungry and need a shower, they remain sleeping until I manually wake them up. (free will is on)Overall, this is an excellent game. The graphics, 3-D rotating camera, and sim interactions are all excellent. The ability to shape and grow your own sim children is the most satisfying aspect of this game, in my opinion. Definitely worth buying.

[Start]I remember when I first received Sims Deluxe Edition years ago when it was first released. I got the game from a friend and started playing it and it soon became a "smash hit," for my computer. A year or so later I received The Sims Unleashed. But I never went out and spent loads of money of buying and installing the other expansion packs the game soon fell out of being fun and I went on to better things.A year ago I decided, after trying to replay my old Sims games, I asked for The Sims Complete Collection. I than got to re-visit with some of the old things I remembered from Sims Deluxe Edition and The Sims Unleashed. But than I got to explore and interact with new surroundings, new items, and new skins! Loads of fun! You have more jobs to choose from and more ways to buy, interact with other Sims.The Sims (where it all started).The Sims (Mac) is the start of it all! You are introduced into a tiny neighborhood if you are only playing on this game (the neighborhood I'm talking about is the one located on the upper right-hand corner of the screen) and only offers about seven lots, not much play fun if you wish for more neighbors to interact with. You have fewer items to buy, skins to choose from, and things to do.But The Sims pact the punch with some other treats, such as The Burglar (a thief that comes to your house at night sometime during the game and steals random items from your home). The way around this is to either install a Burglar Alarm or call for the Police if your home. I once shall the Burglar steal (not the prized TV) but a rug, a wine glass ceiling hanger, and a chair.Not only do you have to worry about Police, but fires. Your Sim can either be sitting by a cozy fireplace or making grub on the stove when a fire can break out. This is due to happen if you Sims cooking skills are low or if a couch or plant is set close to the fireplace. To battle this, get a fire alarm, have your Sim call a Fire Fighter, or put out the flames her/himself, but they can get engulfed and die quickly. Sims have a knack for panicking out of control at the fire, waving their arms and screaming. But besides all the "bad," of this game you can hire a gardener to take care of your plants for you or hire a maid, but this cost money.Speaking of money, you get money from your job just like in real life. But just like in real life, you have to pay the bills and if you don't, more and higher priced bills arrive and eventually you lose the house and you lose the game. You also have to worry about having money to fill your fridge and cook meals to keep your Sim alive. To keep your Sims happy and paying attention to his "Mood," bars. Bladder is also important, which can lead to Sims feeling down or disturbed by wetting the carpet.Appliances have to be kept up-to-date, if a Sims just happens to break the shower or a cooking stove due to lack of skill, they have to repair it. They can either hire somebody for this job, or do it themselves. But if they, once again, are not up to skill with repairing mechanics, they can die. To skill-up your Sims, have them read a book on mechainics or cooking, there are more items for your Sims to up there skills.Sims can have babies, or adopt them. Which is a pain at when the baby is young, but than the baby eventually grows into a full-fledged kid, whom has to go to school and keep his grades up. If not, he is taken away by Child Care and you are left without one.Another fun feature is a rather sad, classic character who will make your Sims absolutely miserable! His name is Sunny The Tragic Clown! You can be visited by him if you buy his picture and if you Sims moods decrease, he shows up to make it worse. To get rid of him, either destroy his picture or get your Sim's moods back up to full-fledged green!Santa Claus can come visit your home if you place out cookies, a Christmas Tree and a fireplace in the same room. Make sure your Sims get to bed so he can arrive! Santa places presents out about the room and than disappears the way he came in, which is buy a red ringed vortex.And the last fellow character is the most horrifying of all, The Grim Reaper. He only visits if you or a fellow Sim has died and you have to play rock-paper-scissors to get them alive again. The result? They come back to life, go ghost, or stay dead. The later is a grave will pop-up (if its outside) or a mourning ashes jar. You Sims can mourn at it over their loss of a fellow spouse or family member.Sims Creator!You can now design your own outfits and even re-do or make your own Sim skins! You can even make Sims that look like you or your family/friends. I even made all the band members from Green Day on SC.The Sims Livin' Large!This expansion pack offers more things to do, and especially more items to buy! Loads of fun! You can also get more Sims skins!The Sims House Party!This was especially fun to play! You can gather all the needs for a party, such as a dance floor, a cage to dance in, plenty of more items to buy and of course more skins. You are able to invite the neighborhood over and party out! Hire some help like a Canter to take care of re-filling the snacks! If you're party is awesome enough, you can be visited by a famous Caleb (that is, if you have Sims Super Star) but otherwise, you are visited by Ze Mine, who will make your House Party a drool.The Sims Hot Date!Your Sims can now go on a date! You are now introduced to Downtown where, of course, you can buy new items. You also get more skins to choose from, new stuff in Build Mode and much more! To get to Downtown, you have to phone in for a cab, which whisk you to the meeting spot wherever you picked from. You can flirt with that special someone by eating dinner and playing footsie in a booth, cuddling, making-out. But if your Sims moods aren't green enough or their relationship up, you might see your Sim get slapped or pushed away.The Sims Vacation!Now your family can go on a vacation, either to a beach resort, a forest to camp out or a snow wonderland! But doesn't pack that punch the others had, for things can get boring after playing for a long time. You Sims can buy things, play archer, volleyball, look for treasure, build sand castle, snowboard on a ramp, flirt in a hot tub, and send mail back to a fellow Sim! You have more skins to choose from, more items to buy and more interactions to enjoy!The Sims Unleashed!You can now buy pets! Choose from a dog, a cat, parrots, turtles, hamsters and fish by going to Old Town to your local pet shop! You can buy items for your pets, and interact with them by playing fetch, ect... But beware, for your pets are a lot like people, and need special edition to keep them home. If not, they become strays or are taken away. You pets can also have puppies/kittens which appear in the dog house or a basket. Its your responsibility to care for them until you can sell them, or keep them if you wish. Also, you can take your pets to shows and win awards. But before that, you have to train them, and that is extremely hard since they not exactly like people. You can't control them really, except make them walk here or there.You can also be visited by fellow pest, such as strays who seek unwanted attention, roaches, mice, rabbits, gophers and raccoons! But your pets can take care of this problem (if they feel like it) by attacking and destroying the pesty animal. Your pets can also die, so make sure to feed them and take care of their bladder. You can also buy them treats, scratching post, beds and toys.The Sims Superstar!Yes folks, you can now be a superstar! But at what? You can be a famous rock star, a fashionist, or movie actress or a performer! But this you have to work at, which is far more engrossing than having a regular job/career. You have to have lots of friends, of course, your skills must be up to the max to succeed, and you have to have lots and lots of famous friends! This is tough, for if you don't have enough "Star Power," (how high you are up on the Hot List) than the rich and famous will ignore you. Battle this buy obtaining Sims friends that are as low as you are but have a bit of star power. Eventually you will get higher friends and keep at it in Studio Town by either performing at the karaoke or acting out a script. If you work at it enough, you can become a Super Star!Another feature in this is a few other things. You can now hire a butler, an are harassed by Obsessed Fans that follow you everywhere you go, even to your house! To battle this, you can download an Odd Body Guard that beams them down and makes their life a living hell!The Sims Makin' Magic!In Makin' Magic your Sims can now be fellow witches and wizards! Perform magic, buy magical items and of course, get more stuff to interact with!

You can open the box and receive magical items to make your magic, such as a spell book, a A Spellbound Wand Charge and a EverAfter Crafter. You can also buy a hole that is an instant ticket to Magic Town where you buy all your ingredients and do quest to gain rare magical items. You also are able to bake your own ingredients, have more skins and items to choose from. And can even buy yourself a dragon egg! But the dragon egg has to be cared for constantly unless you want a hatchling to flame your house down upon hatching!Besides getting regular Sim money, you get Magic Coins which can be exchanged for goods. If you save up enough, you can buy a creepy, haunted house located in Magic Town.This is my favorite Sim game out of all of them.[Fun Extras]You can download more items, skins, ect... from sites online, use cheat codes to "green-up," your Sims Health, make more money and even in-put your own music/shows for TV/Computer.[Finish]I hope you have found the following review helpful (if not time consuming). Definitely buy this game for your children or for yourself! I have spent hours on this game and find it very satisfying!
I love this game.  The idea of the game is to create a person-a man or a woman-young or old- that may or may not have a family-you decide-you choose what they look like, how clean, how active, how nice, how serious, etc.. they are. You decide what they look like and what they will wear for everyday, pjs, swimwear and formal.You decide if they'll have a family and how many will be in the family. You decide if they will be pretty or ugly, their likes, their dislikes and their aspirations.You go to the main screen and then you decide where they will live. What neighborhood? How big of a lot to build the house on?  They all start off with the same amount of money and you have to build your house within that budget (20,000 sim bucks) or you can buy a premade house. OR you can type in a cheat to give your sims free money.You move your simmies in and then decorate your house with furniture you have to buy from the buy menu screen.  You choose sofas, rugs, decorations, toilets, kitchen cabinets, etc...You choose how many bathrooms, bedrooms and you choose the colors of the wallpaper and floors and the windows and doors and where these items will go in/on the home.The sims have needs.  They have to have food (fridge/stove, or order delivery otherwise they'll die a horrible slow death with pain and suffering-unable to sleep and function) they need to use the bathroom (toilet or they will pee on the floor and lose their dignity)  they need a shower or they will have green smoke coming off them and when their needs aren't being met-they will look up at you from their Sim world and wave their arms trying to get your attention and with thier Sims dialect- which is not english and is incomprehensible-they will scream out to you (I am roughly translating what I think they're saying ) "Help me-I need a shower!  I stink!!!  Look at the green smoke coming off of me! Please! People person who controls my life-My GOD-PLEASE-give me a shower or a sink to bathe myself in!!!" and you may show mercy and give them something to bathe in or you can be a cruel god and let them suffer.  Muahahahahaha!!!!!!!You make them find a job on their computer or from the newspaper that's delivered in front of their house everyday.  They have to pay bills that are delivered by a mailman every 3 days in their mailbox.  You can have them open their own business from home (expansion pack Open for Business) or lease land and open a store. You decide what to sell and how much to sell it for.You make them go to work-or school or you can make them play hookey and make them lose their jobs and become fat lazy bums.  OH yes, and they do become fat if they don't exercise.  You have to make them swim, workout, exercise on a machine or do some other activity-otherwise they get FAT.  You decide what they eat and what they eat depends on how well you've taught your Simmies how to cook.You can make them call other sims or they can greet them into their homes as visitors.  But you cannot go off your lot to go visit them.  Although you can take your own car or call a cab and go downtown(with the right expansion pack Nightlife) or to a store in the neighborhood and you can go shopping or eat dinner out or go for a night on the town with other simmie friends.You meet a mate-male or female-gay or straight- you can live together, be engaged or get married.  You can have kids or you can adopt-you can even buy or adopt a pet (expansion pack Pets).  You then teach your kids/pets to be good or bad-to love them or neglect them (You can't kill the kids-yes, I've tried-you'll understand when you've had one that's turned into a toddler-grrrrr...the social worker takes them away before they are too badly damaged but you can make the little suckers suffer or you can show the little angels mercy and give them a good, loving home. (I don't know about killing the pets, I've never tried killing an animal.I don't care how much they pee on the floor or rip up the furniture-I cannot try to kill a dog or a cat even on my most evil days. And YES You WILL have EVIL days, my friends and your simmies will suffer for it although you don't have to save the game when you're finished and the next time you load it'll be like nothing ever happened. :)When the brats grow up and go to high school you can send them off to college (Expansion pack University City) after a week, I think. And you can follow the kid into college you decide their major and their friends and love interests and make them do well in school or fail and then when they graduate  they become adults and they move back into the regular neighborhood again.Oh, and the simmies age and they live as a baby, toddler, child, teenager, young adult, adult, elder and then they crook. During their lives they can become zombies, vampires, aliens, plant people and there may be more.  ONe of my simmies were abducted by aliens and one was biten by a vampire.  It depends on what expansion pack you have.  But this Sims 2 game without the expansion pack-you can be abducted by aliens and give birth to aliens. And when you die-you even get a tombstone or an urn.  They can come back as ghosts but you can't control them.THat sums up the game. It's a lot of fun.  I like following the family generations.  You can have a grandchild or a great grandchild.  There are cheats to make them stop aging if you want, also.Don't waste your money on the console version-the PC version is so much more superior.  But you have to have the right specs on your computer so make sure to check those out before buying the game. It was worth upgrading my computer-to me.  I have this and most of the expansion packs but don't waste your money on the "stuff" expansion packs because besides the meshes for items-it's really a waste of money. I was not at all happy with the Family stuff expansion pack I got.  All the things were ugly and there were only a couple of dozen things-for $20? Bleh!  You can download FREE stuff for your Simmies by going to reputational websites like [...] and [...]  Read the how-to page and first download the necessary free software from the website. They have how-to pages.  Taking the time to understand what you need and what you have to do and reading what items you have to download meshes for goes a long way and in the end it makes for a great gaming experience.  Especially if you like to create great houses, interior design and totally unique people.Anyway, if your computer has the right specs-definetly buy this game.  It is so much fun and addicting.  :)

The Sims 3 Seasons is the expansion pack so many have been waiting for, and it's everything I hoped it would be, and more! Every season is packed with new objects, clothing, interactions and community lots to visit. The changing seasons and the weather give the Sims 3 world a whole new life, and bring back that same magic from years ago, the first time we saw it snow in the Sims 2.After installing this pack, the first thing you'll notice is all the new community lots. A new Festival Grounds will be placed in your town, with many more lots also available to add. There are new homes in addition to the community lots ( several parks and different festival grounds). These new community lots are designed with all the new fun activities for your Sims to try out, for each of the seasons. There are over 100 new items, including things like kissing booths, dance floors, concession stands, eating competitions, photo booths, snowboards half-pipe, snow-cone machines, new grills, face painting and tons of new decorative items like Christmas lights and new building items.With your new seasons, you can also change their length and frequency in the "options" menu. There are 4 seasons and you can set them to be as short as 3 days or as long as 28 days. Each season can be set accordingly. You can also uncheck the box for a particular season, and completely skip that season all together. You now have a temperature and season icon on your Sims main panel, that lets you know the current temperature and how many days until the change in the season. You can chose to have this displayed in either Celsius or Fahrenheit.As the seasons change so do the activities your Sims will be able to participate in. Playing soccer, ice skating, roller skating and yes....even making snowmen are all options for your Sims to partake in.  When your Sims are outside and the temperature is cold, you can even see their breath in the air. And to go along with the new seasons, there's new clothing. The new outfits in this pack are about the only thing there is just a moderate amount of. There is a new tab in the clothing screen where you choose your Sims outfits, for outerwear. All of the sweaters, vests and coats that were already in the clothing options have been moved to this tab, with the addition of a few new coats. There are also new snow pants, a few new bathing suites, gloves, goggles (summer and winter), boots, water shoes, face masks and some new long-johns for sleep ware. While there is a handful of new clothing items, there's not as much as other expansion packs in the past have had, likeThe Sims 3 Supernatural, which was overflowing with new clothing and accessories.However what this pack is lacking in new clothing, it makes up for in so many other ways. The seasons and weather are beautiful. While this pack has all the most well loved aspects from the Sims 2 Seasons pack, there is also a ton of other new and fun content as well. There's so much to do and new surprises around every corner, it will take weeks to explore everything. Whether you want to bob for apples, ice skate in a blizzard or go tanning in a Sims tanning booth to get that perfect summertime glow, you can do it now, with the Sims 3 Seasons.
Unless you've been living down a big, dark hole for the past 4 years, The Sims will need no introduction. Not only was this game the biggest selling PC game of all time but it also offered a completely new experience for all those wannabe Gods out there, there was nothing like it before and apart from the numerous expansion packs the only thing that came close afterwards was Singles: Flirt Up Your Life which was basically The Sims, with more emphasis on bedroom antics!But now, after much anticipation, The Sims 2 has arrived! If there is anyone out there still asking "but what are The Sims?" then you really need to get out more, or maybe I need to get out more? Either way The Sims offers a simple concept, players get to create a little computer person (or a whole family), design them a house and then completely run (or ruin!) their lives from their career, relationships and even bathroom habits. So what is The Sims 2? Well take everything I've just said and make it 100 times better and you have The Sims 2!As soon as you start the game up the first major change that hits you are the games graphics which take The Sims totally into 3D, the 3 pre-designed neighbourhoods that come with the game are huge filled with tree's, rivers, bridges, flying birds and of course an array of houses (some empty and some housing numerous new families) and what's more, each neighbourhood is totally different with their own stories and overall style, fans of the first game will recognise many of the families in "Pleasantville" such as the Goths who now consist of a greying Mortimer and an adult Cassandra, Bella has mysteriously vanished however.The next change that hit us was the "Create a family" option which has also had a major overhaul allowing players to create totally custom Sims with a number of hairstyles, hair colours, pre-set faces, types of facial hair, eye colour and clothes and to make it even more editable, players can fiddle with numerous parts of their Sim to get him or her looking just right from the shape of their eyes, width of their chin and length of their nose; everything is customisable. In short, players can re-create anyone they want to from real life family members to celebrities to a spooky likeness providing they have the time and patience to mess around with the editor for long enough! As I'm sure you have guessed, this "create a Sim" editor is a massive improvement on the first games "create" mode but if we're going to be picky, one cant help wondering why Maxis left out other important feature changers in the editor such as height and a few more body shapes (at present we have thin and fat), I know there is always room for expansion packs (as we know from the original!) but with such an excellent "Create" mode, it's a shame they didn't go the whole way and add more body adjusters.So, you've chosen a neighbourhood (or created your own), have created a family of Sims and are now ready to move them into a pre-made house or design them your own. Should you choose the latter you will notice the next obvious change to the franchise. The build tool has been considerably improved, houses can have a maximum of 3 floors as well as foundations and a roof top floor allowing players to build much bigger homes for their families than in the first game and as you would expect, the game offers a much wider variety of floors, doors, windows, wall coverings and fences allowing players to really design a custom home from scratch and thanks to the 3D graphics and variety of build tools homes in The Sims 2 look much more realistic than ever before.Also to feature a lot more variety is the "buy" mode which gives a number of colour and style variations with almost everything that is available to buy, clicking on a bed for instance will bring up a number of options including the colour of the wood and bed covers allowing you to truly mix and match the objects in your house.So onto the actual gameplay and again, despite the concept of the game being the same (keep your Sims happy) The Sims 2 feels different from the very moment you being to control your families, for a start the `characters' that you create have a much deeper feel to them, they seem to show expressions, develop their own feelings and come with a host of new animations that allow them to show off their new personalities. No longer do they carry the very basic needs such as "bladder" and "hunger" (although you still have to tend to these), your Sims now come with life aspirations meaning they aspire to a particular goal in life from fortune (their goal is to be rich), knowledge (these Sims have a passion for learning), Family (self explanatory, family orientated), Popularity (these Sims "need" to be popular) and Romance (again, self explanatory).You simply cannot explain this without an example so take my family of Sims, "The Simtons" which consist of a mother (Sarah) and father (Dave) and a young son (Robert). Now, Sarah was blessed with the family aspiration and wanted nothing more than a big, happy family. Unfortunately for her she was partnered (by my good self!) to Dave who had the fortune aspiration meaning he was obsessed with earning money, getting the kid into private school and swatting for promotion. Down the road lived the young "Andrew" who carried with him the romance aspiration and whilst Dave was at work one day, Andrew and Sarah got to know each other pretty well, in fact, they ended up sleeping together, nothing too exciting so far right? Well unfortunately little Robert had seen the goings on and was stood outside waiting to greet his father from work in tears, Dave came home and Sarah came running downstairs all very innocent, she walked past Dave as if nothing had happened with a sheepish wipe of her mouth and a quick shake of the head Sarah thought she had gotten away with her quick rumble upstairs...Dave however had been told of what had happened and refused to speak to her for days, in fact it took quite a while for me to get their marriage back on track! At this point, you would've been forgiven for forgetting that these characters are not real people, despite the great job they do of convincing you otherwise!Another way they try to convince you of their realism is through their animations, Sims will now lounge across the settee with their feet up and head resting in their hands, in bed adult Sims will cuddle up to each other and when watching TV, parents and children can snuggle up together while two adults can get "romantic" on the couch! I bought one of my Sims a double bed after it showed up as a "want" of hers (more on this later), she was so pleased with her new possession that she promptly began re-arranging the pillows and then laid down on it and began day dreaming, it looked so realistic. Toddlers can also be found crawling across the floor in search of an adult and young children play a number of games including the very violent "cops and robbers" which involves one of them falling to the ground after being "shot" by the other!Ok, so The Sims 2 is more realistic, what else is new? Well as mentioned earlier, the Sims now develop "wants and fears" in addition to their "needs", wants usually accompany the Sims aspiration so a "fortune Sim" will constantly want expensive furniture, promotions and money whilst a "popularity Sim" will want to make new friends and host big parties. Fears can be based on a number of things such as the death of a loved one, a grade D report card or a rejection of a kiss, its your job to fulfil their wants and stay clear of their fears and watch the aspiration metre fill up, points are awarded for completed wants and a good aspiration meter puts your Sims in a `platinum' mood.Finally, your Sims will now age, there are 6 stages to a Sims life ranging from baby, toddler, child, teenager, adult and finally, old age and unlike in the original game, Sims can now die of old age. Families are also backed by a family tree meaning that the game remembers who is related to who so in practice, you could raise a child to a teenager, through adulthood, witness them raise their own children and finally grandchildren before he or she dies leaving a long history behind him. This feature adds tons to the depth of the gameplay.So that's the game, but the question is, was it worth the 4 year wait? In a word, yes. The Sims 2 is what everyone wanted The Sims to be, the graphics are great, Sims get a couple of days off work and school for socialising and brushing up on skills, everything is fully customisable from the houses to the Sims themselves and the aging system coupled with the aspiration system just makes The Sims 2 more addictive than ever and what's more, they no longer take 1 hour to use the toilet and no longer need to go to bed at 17:00 in order to get up for work in a morning! If you're a fan of the original, you will love this, if you hated The Sims first time around, chances are you will hate this one too but on the whole Maxis have done an excellent job of creating a successful sequel to the best selling PC game of all time.

Well take everything I've just said and make it 100 times better and you have The Sims 2!As soon as you start the game up the first major change that hits you are the games graphics which take The Sims totally into 3D, the 3 pre-designed neighbourhoods that come with the game are huge filled with tree's, rivers, bridges, flying birds and of course an array of houses (some empty and some housing numerous new families) and what's more, each neighbourhood is totally different with their own stories and overall style, fans of the first game will recognise many of the families in "Pleasantville" such as the Goths who now consist of a greying Mortimer and an adult Cassandra, Bella has mysteriously vanished however.The next change that hit us was the "Create a family" option which has also had a major overhaul allowing players to create totally custom Sims with a number of hairstyles, hair colours, pre-set faces, types of facial hair, eye colour and clothes and to make it even more editable, players can fiddle with numerous parts of their Sim to get him or her looking just right from the shape of their eyes, width of their chin and length of their nose; everything is customisable. In short, players can re-create anyone they want to from real life family members to celebrities to a spooky likeness providing they have the time and patience to mess around with the editor for long enough! As I'm sure you have guessed, this "create a Sim" editor is a massive improvement on the first games "create" mode but if we're going to be picky, one cant help wondering why Maxis left out other important feature changers in the editor such as height and a few more body shapes (at present we have thin and fat), I know there is always room for expansion packs (as we know from the original!) but with such an excellent "Create" mode, it's a shame they didn't go the whole way and add more body adjusters.So, you've chosen a neighbourhood (or created your own), have created a family of Sims and are now ready to move them into a pre-made house or design them your own. Should you choose the latter you will notice the next obvious change to the franchise. The build tool has been considerably improved, houses can have a maximum of 3 floors as well as foundations and a roof top floor allowing players to build much bigger homes for their families than in the first game and as you would expect, the game offers a much wider variety of floors, doors, windows, wall coverings and fences allowing players to really design a custom home from scratch and thanks to the 3D graphics and variety of build tools homes in The Sims 2 look much more realistic than ever before.Also to feature a lot more variety is the "buy" mode which gives a number of colour and style variations with almost everything that is available to buy, clicking on a bed for instance will bring up a number of options including the colour of the wood and bed covers allowing you to truly mix and match the objects in your house.So onto the actual gameplay and again, despite the concept of the game being the same (keep your Sims happy) The Sims 2 feels different from the very moment you being to control your families, for a start the `characters' that you create have a much deeper feel to them, they seem to show expressions, develop their own feelings and come with a host of new animations that allow them to show off their new personalities. No longer do they carry the very basic needs such as "bladder" and "hunger" (although you still have to tend to these), your Sims now come with life aspirations meaning they aspire to a particular goal in life from fortune (their goal is to be rich), knowledge (these Sims have a passion for learning), Family (self explanatory, family orientated), Popularity (these Sims "need" to be popular) and Romance (again, self explanatory).You simply cannot explain this without an example so take my family of Sims, "The Simtons" which consist of a mother (Sarah) and father (Dave) and a young son (Robert). Now, Sarah was blessed with the family aspiration and wanted nothing more than a big, happy family. Unfortunately for her she was partnered (by my good self!) to Dave who had the fortune aspiration meaning he was obsessed with earning money, getting the kid into private school and swatting for promotion. Down the road lived the young "Andrew" who carried with him the romance aspiration and whilst Dave was at work one day, Andrew and Sarah got to know each other pretty well, in fact, they ended up sleeping together, nothing too exciting so far right? Well unfortunately little Robert had seen the goings on and was stood outside waiting to greet his father from work in tears, Dave came home and Sarah came running downstairs all very innocent, she walked past Dave as if nothing had happened with a sheepish wipe of her mouth and a quick shake of the head Sarah thought she had gotten away with her quick rumble upstairs...Dave however had been told of what had happened and refused to speak to her for days, in fact it took quite a while for me to get their marriage back on track! At this point, you would've been forgiven for forgetting that these characters are not real people, despite the great job they do of convincing you otherwise!Another way they try to convince you of their realism is through their animations, Sims will now lounge across the settee with their feet up and head resting in their hands, in bed adult Sims will cuddle up to each other and when watching TV, parents and children can snuggle up together while two adults can get "romantic" on the couch! I bought one of my Sims a double bed after it showed up as a "want" of hers (more on this later), she was so pleased with her new possession that she promptly began re-arranging the pillows and then laid down on it and began day dreaming, it looked so realistic. Toddlers can also be found crawling across the floor in search of an adult and young children play a number of games including the very violent "cops and robbers" which involves one of them falling to the ground after being "shot" by the other!Ok, so The Sims 2 is more realistic, what else is new? Well as mentioned earlier, the Sims now develop "wants and fears" in addition to their "needs", wants usually accompany the Sims aspiration so a "fortune Sim" will constantly want expensive furniture, promotions and money whilst a "popularity Sim" will want to make new friends and host big parties. Fears can be based on a number of things such as the death of a loved one, a grade D report card or a rejection of a kiss, its your job to fulfil their wants and stay clear of their fears and watch the aspiration metre fill up, points are awarded for completed wants and a good aspiration meter puts your Sims in a `platinum' mood.Finally, your Sims will now age, there are 6 stages to a Sims life ranging from baby, toddler, child, teenager, adult and finally, old age and unlike in the original game, Sims can now die of old age. Families are also backed by a family tree meaning that the game remembers who is related to who so in practice, you could raise a child to a teenager, through adulthood, witness them raise their own children and finally grandchildren before he or she dies leaving a long history behind him. This feature adds tons to the depth of the gameplay.So that's the game, but the question is, was it worth the 4 year wait? In a word, yes. The Sims 2 is what everyone wanted The Sims to be, the graphics are great, Sims get a couple of days off work and school for socialising and brushing up on skills, everything is fully customisable from the houses to the Sims themselves and the aging system coupled with the aspiration system just makes The Sims 2 more addictive than ever and what's more, they no longer take 1 hour to use the toilet and no longer need to go to bed at 17:00 in order to get up for work in a morning! If you're a fan of the original, you will love this, if you hated The Sims first time around, chances are you will hate this one too but on the whole Maxis have done an excellent job of creating a successful sequel to the best selling PC game of all time.

How many Medal of Honor games are on the market these days?  More than enough!  Let's talk about the very first one, on the original Playstation.  This game is a fantastic first-person shooter *and* a great World War II game.  You get the best of both worlds with Medal of Honor.I'm somewhat embarrassed to admit that when it comes to first-person shooters, I am absolutely *horrible* at them.  Enemies seem to find a way to come out of nowhere ALL the time and cheap-shot me, and then, of course, I die very quickly.  With most games like this, you barely have enough time to react to their insane shooting rampage and learn the controls before it's quickly "game over".  With Medal of Honor I can FINALLY put those nightmare problems to rest.  I can actually complete about 50% of this game, which, by my standards, is a BIG pat on the back.  I never would have guessed understanding a game like this was possible (and be able to complete some levels) but it's true!  Here's why:- The buttons are laid out *perfectly* on the Playstation controller.  The target button is really easy to use.  You can use the directional pad to move it around and locate the enemy.  It never fails. The shoot button works great.  The jump and duck buttons work great.  EVERYTHING works great!  When you aim at something before shooting, it actually works.  It's amazing how many games get this wrong and the whole experience is ruined.  The play control is a major improvement compared to Syphon Filter, for example.  In that game, it felt like I was awkwardly walking or sliding all over the place.- The challenge in Medal of Honor is perfect for people who are NOT professionals when it comes to first-person shooters.  The challenge in each level builds and builds, very slowly, allowing you to learn and master the controls while you make progress.  Syphon Filter fails to do this.  So does Metal Gear Solid.  Medal of Honor is an easy-to-understand shooting game for people who normally aren't very good at these kind of games.  I really want to thank DreamWorks (the company responsible for this game) for making the challenge just right.Also, you encounter just a few cutscenes here and there, and each one is very interesting to watch because they show you what it was like during World War II, and you may even learn some stuff about the war that you've never known before.  Good cutscenes.The objectives you have to complete are always pretty fun, and not too difficult (until later in the game).  When I say "not too difficult" I mean, not too difficult to understand *and* not too difficult to complete.  Whenever you want to find out what you have to do, just press the Start button and your short and simple objectives will be given to you right there.As a shooting game, Medal of Honor shines and easily surpasses most first-person shooters once again.  Enemies are everywhere, and many of them want you dead immediately.  Luckily, they give you enough time to react.  When you arrive to a harder level later on... well, keep in mind that you will have to keep playing certain levels over and over, and learn where each and every enemy is located, and take them out as quickly and effectively as you can.  Trust me, this is really fun.  It's *so* much fun to find out which gun you're carrying is most effective on the enemy you encounter.  You will probably lose a bunch of times while you learn, but this is all part of the fun.  Making it to the end of a level *doesn't* require luck like in Syphon Filter, and you will feel satisfied once you've completed a stage.  You can even play the completed stages over and over again, if you want.  Medal of Honor is so good, why not play the same stages over a hundred times?I don't know what else to say.  I love this game.  Oh yeah, the music and sound effects!  The music is like listening to a suspenseful, realistic war movie.  It's really good.  The sound effects are awesome as well because each soldier you encounter has something interesting and different to say.  You will be amazed at how many new lines these soliders can come up with!  You will hear the sound of silence while walking around in the dark, along with the sound of distant gunshots and other creepy sounds.  All this adds up to a disturbingly, realistic wartime experience.Oh, and the animations you will see from enemies falling over after they've been shot is *clearly* a notch above the rest.  Even after killing these guys a million times, they seem to find new ways to amaze me with their ability to squirm around and struggle to survive.  Simply put, you will *always* see soldiers do different things before they die. Sometimes they shoot wildly all over the place while falling over and dying.  Other times they will fall to their knees before falling over for good.  Wherever you shoot on their body, they will react very realistically.  Shoot them in the foot they hop around.  These are probably normal and understandable things that a human being would do if they were dying.The weapons are what you'd expect in a wartime game.  Very good weapons, and very easy to aim and use them on an enemy.  No problems here.I haven't encountered any blood in the game yet, but, as far as I'm concerned, blood is overrated because the color red is just that- a color.  It means nothing to the actual gameplay.Some very minor problems I had is that sometimes your main character moves around too quickly, which means sometimes you may accidentally walk right into danger, and the graphics are slightly dark and dated.  Just slightly.  Don't forget the occasional Playstation glitches.  Also, there are actually loading times in the game.  It takes 10-15 seconds to load a stage.  I thought by 1999, loading times were a thing of the past.  Despite these problems, Medal of Honor is still a near-perfect game.Overall, please buy this awesome first-person shooter.  Today, in 2007, first-person shooters and war games (specifically World War II games) are all OVER the place to the point where it's almost boring to play one anymore.  This is because war time games are a genre that has lost its appeal over the years, thanks to overexposure and repeating more or less the same required-strategies with each new game that gets released.  In other words, all war games are basically the same thing these days.  It's boring.  But guess what?  Back in 1999, when Medal of Honor was brand new, the Playstation didn't have a whole lot of games like this, and war games were treated with more respect, which make Medal of Honor all the more special. Pick it up.

The original Syphon Filter had pretty decent visuals. They may have not compared to Metal Gear's, but were still pretty good. In the sequel, the visuals were slightly changed, there are just a few tweaks around the edges and that is all about it. The CGs on the other hand look excellent, they don't show a single sign of poor data compression and they remain smooth the whole time. In my opinion, I would compare them to those found in Final Fantasy and Resident Evil titles. The stage design is excellent, SF2 includes most of the stages from the first one in the two player DeathMatch mode and that made me feel kind of all tingly inside. The new courses are flooded with great looking environments and navigation. Some stages are extremely huge and it takes quite a long time to check them all out. The character detail is there but it lacks in good polish. You won't find grain here, but you will find some sharp edges on bodies. I noticed that the bodies in SF2 look a bit edgy on the sides, it isn't very noticeable, but it's there. Syphon Filter 2's graphics aren't very bad, they just need a little refinement and that's all, otherwise the visuals are fine.I'll admit it, not much has changed thought the sequel. The gameplay remains the same, but that is a good thing. When I picked up SF2 I felt like I was right at home, it didn't take me any adjustment at all. From the moment I picked up my Dual Shock I was able to smell the blood of the enemies. Though the gameplay style may not be different, I'll tell you what is, the value. Not only does SF2 carry a two disk package, but it also contains over 20 global areas to shoot some ass on. The game starts out with Lian and Gabe at the Pharcom Wharehouse, they are putting the finishing touches on the pace when helicopters come in and start havoc. During the process Lian is kidnapped and she has also been infected with the Syphon Filter virus. Gabe quickly gets to his feet and he starts his journey and escape. The game has a few new faces such as Teresa, who is Lian's fill-in and new bosses to give Gabe a hard time.The Two-Player Mode is an one killer addition to the sequel. It really gives the game more value, there are tons of characters to choose from, but many of them have to be unlocked. The stages that you play on are either the original Syphon Filter stages, or new ones that need to be unlocked. Of the top of my head I'm guessing that there are about 30 Two-Player characters and that includes Gabe Logan, Lian Xing, Mara Aramov, Uri Gregarov and more old faces from the first SF as well as new faces from the sequel. With the sequel not only comes more stages, but more artillery. Gabe has now got over 25 weapons and gadgets to help him out on his missions. And finally speaking of missions, the game is divided into two parts, not only do you play as Gabe but you also have the chance to play as Lian for a segment of the game. That's about for the gameplay portion of SF2, if you thought that the gameplay was great just wait till you read about the sound.Like the first Syphon Filter, SF2 has voice acting. The quality is as great as ever and at no time did I find myself trying to figure out what Gabe, Lian or Teresa had said. The background theme still remains, so those who liked that touch will be pleased to know that it is back. The explosions sound great, and so do the gun shots for that matter. I can't really think of much to say about the sound, because it is basically the same as the original and it's just not a very deep subject.All rejoice, people who have hard times getting used to controls in sequels can now settle down and stop worrying. SF2 features the exact same control layout as Syphon Filter. Shoot, roll, side step, aim, all of them are at their original placement. But Gabe has now learned how to jump, instead of just plummeting to his death Gabe will now jump at a ledge. As for the basic stuff like Analog and Dual Shock, it's all there and both are working great.For those who loved every second of Syphon Filter (like me), will love every second of Syphon Filter 2. The visuals may have remained the same but everything else has changed. Excellent gameplay, great sound, the same control and especially the Two-Player Mode make Syphon Filter 2 a definite winner. A must have!

What I mean by the title is this; the first time you play it, you won't be thinking "game" at all.Instead, you'll be pulled in by the surreal graphics, compelling storyline, and realistic characters.I can honestly say that this is my favorite game, due to the fact that it actually became part of my life, instead of me beating it and getting ready for the next game.I never knew what "psychological damage" was, exactly, until I played this.Though it didn't damage me in the ways of: I need to suicide or go do drugs, but more in the way of slight depression; nothing so serious that you'd need a shrink or anything, but more of a sadness.After you beat it the first time, you'll have most likely gone down the path you've chosen and have liked the way it turned out. If that's the case, the 2nd+ time you play it and go down a different path, you'll have to do certain things that you normally wouldn't. This is kind of what messes it up, because the first time you play it, you want your actions and responses to be right, or just how you want them to be. Then when you play again, you'll start feeling uncomfortable since you don't REALLY want to do the things you're doing, but just have to do it to see the other endings.After I played it the first time, then started on the 2nd/3rd play through, it started becoming more of a game, and was "easily-put-downable" when I started getting frustrated/bored. (Not really frustrated or bored, but the first time you play it you don't want to stop playing because you HAVE to see what happens next, but after you play it once, it loses the gripping factor.)People will say that the shocking twist near the end of the game ruins it; I say otherwise.Though I can agree that it "may" ruin it, I still like the way the characters react and deal with the situation.So for me, the game never goes into an " aw, that ruined my whole experience! " moment, ever.There are 57 trophies in the game, in which you are awarded by doing specific and particular things within each chapter.I updated this game the moment I got it, which was a tedious 1.1gb download, and with my slow internet I had to wait a whole day until it finished.I never played it before I patched it, but I figured if I'm going to play it, I might as well download the patch; seeing as it fixed camera issues, new main menu and supposedly bonus content (making-of videos).I got the version of Heavy Rain without the blue PS Move compatible logo, so I don't know if that version has the update pre-installed or not, seeing as it's the Move Compatible version.But the patch installed on the previous version installs the Move patch as well, so everyone can enjoy Move no matter what version they have.It's very hard to express why this game is great without telling spoilers; but if you're like me, I didn't want to see a single video of Heavy Rain before I got it, because I knew it would ruin everything - and I can say, if I had watched a video of Heavy Rain prior to gameplay, I would have been upset seeing as playing this game without knowledge of anything is the best way to go.I don't even know if I've started the review yet, but let me start explaining the aspects of the game.The game is single player, has trophies, and has 1 Downloadable Content episode (the game creator has basically said that after they finished working on PS Move version of Heavy Rain, and they started working on new DLC they figured it would waste time, and said that they would rather work on a new project, instead of spending more time on Heavy Rain.)Which I find stupid, how can you "waste time" on something that can still be played?But, I am fine with this, especially after playing the first and most-likely only DLC.(*1*) - GRAPHICS: 9.0The graphics in this game are spectacular, the skin textures and overall ambiance are better than any game I've ever seen.I watched video reviews, (after the fact), and I saw that they were all complaining about a few things, one in particular is how this game is supposed to be a cinematic presentation-styled game, yet some scenes of the game's textures are terrible.This is true, even though I don't feel that way about it.I admit, some scenes will have the character's face slimy-looking and textureless, and while these scenes and moments in the game come a little bit too often, it doesn't ruin gameplay aspects, but it will be noticeable and might have an awkward " uhh " effect on you and anyone watching you play it.Other than that, graphics are great, one of the few games (if not only) that actually makes rain in a game look good.----------------------------------------------------------(*2*) - STORYLINE: 10I might be a bit off with giving it a 10, but I'll explain.As I've said above, the first time you play it, you just know that the game is just what you're looking for (if you're looking for one of the few great Mystery/Crime games.)Some people will say the game is very slow and boring in the beginning, but quickly ramps up after an hour or so; but I say different. I'm actually pleased that the game developers gave the audience time to introduce the characters, instead of just starting the game in mid-battle or like you already know them and are well-acquainted;The story introduces each character and shows you what their issues are, or what they have to deal with daily, and gives you a starting point on how you want to play with your characters.What I didn't know in the beginning, though now I do, is why all your actions, in the beginning and middle of the game, don't actually change anything towards the story or the ending.But now I see that it's because the game is trying to shape your opinion of your character.It's basically testing you in the beginning/middle of the game, to see what you want your characters to do when it all starts coming down.I do agree, though, that the game gets a lot better after your choices REALLY start to mean something.You honestly start to feel sad and scared when your characters are in near-death experiences.This is the FIRST game EVER, that I was actually scared for my CHARACTERS life in any game.It wasn't like "Oh no, I'm gonna die", it was more like "OH NO, NORMAN'S GONNA DIE!!!!!11!!!1!111!"It tells you something if you're playing a game, and are actually scared for your characters, instead of only scared that you, yourself, are about to lose a battle.People also say that the characters are good and all, but aren't enough for you to connect with them and get a chance to feel for them. I could say that it's true and untrue. Reason is, you don't ever feel like you're INSIDE your character, but more like you're just looking at them from the outside. However, who can say that being inside them is so great?From what I've seen, looking at them from the outside is still an emotional ride. I felt for each character like it was someone I knew going through these things (all thanks to the introductory part of the game.)This would have to be my favorite storyline of any game, because it's one game that actually left it's mark in my memory; a solid mark.---------------------------------------------------------(*3*) GAMEPLAY - 9.0It's hard to say when it comes to this game's gameplay. I don't know how to explain it.I've read that people say that this game is just one big quick time event, and that they will hate Q.T.E.'s in any game they play from now on. My ending results didn't tally up to that one.There ARE a lot of Q.T.E.'s, but it isn't so much to the point of you wanting to destroy all Q.T.E.'s.I never had a problem with it, or even moments where I thought to myself: "When will this be OVER!!?!?!?"When it comes to movement in games, you'd think move the analog left or right to go left or right, but this game is a little bit different. Yeah, you move by holding R2, then moving the left Analog stick in which way you want to go, but it's a bit hard at times. Specifically moments where the camera automatically switches when you walk pass a certain point, then you try to turn left or something, then you'll start going backwards and the camera flicks back to the way it was before you CAME to that point. All in all, it's annoying, but only when you get to those moments in the game.But with that aside, movement in this game is realistic, and never at a time does it make you tired of walking.My game has only gotten stuck 2 times, even though I've had it just a week, but to my knowledge and what I've seen, the game doesn't get stuck every chapter, maybe like just once the whole game.-------------------------------------------(*4*) SOUND - 9.5Personally I love the soundtrack, it complements the weary ambiance and sad game tone, and adds to what you feel for your character. People say that the characters' voices in the game are at-times: terrible. I could agree, but then I think of the reason why people are saying they're terrible. Everyone's voice in the game is pretty much top-notch, except the character Norman Jayden.His voice can sound tremendously weird at times, and will make you a little bit scared for no reason at all.The voice actor would turn some words into the weirdest thing yet. Example; a sentence he said in the game was similar to this: "All the victims were drowned in rain water."  Ok, sound right? Well this is how he pronounced it:"All the victims wuh drowned in rain wahtuh."  It's kinda creepy; it does it on similar occasions in parts of the game.But then, I realized something. This game was made in Europe (Quantic Dream is a European based company) IE: SCEE (Sony Computer Entertainment Europe.) And I guess to people, the way he pronounces things would make them think "Why is this an American game, and is supposed to be American characters, yet the voices sound like they aren't?" And for some reason, they think of it as a negative, and that it's bad voice acting.But this game ISN'T American. And though the game's story is based on the east coast of USA, (most likely somewhere along the lines of New York), who says the characters in the game ARE American? Especially with Norman Jayden being an FBI agent, not normally stationed in this east coast city.So I just disagree with statements such as it's an American game, with non-American voice actors.But I will say that at times, at least every character has 1 moment in the game where they sound weird.---------------------------------------------(*5*) MISCELLANEOUSBefore I got this game, I was quite worried about the nudity in the game.Reading on websites, it kind of made it seem like a full-on, non-stop, "IN YO FACE" kind of thing.This is NOT the case. There are just 3 times in the game in which you encounter these scenes.Only 1 time will you be unable to bypass it. (2 times if you want a platinum trophy)The first scene you'll be forced to watch, it's Ethan in the shower.It doesn't show anything in the front, just his butt. It may seem like it's going to show more than that with the way the camera moves, but that's it. It gets a bit weird when he gets out and you have to shake the controller to dry him off with a towel..The 2nd scene is when you play with Madison, she'll have an OPTION to take a shower, in which she takes off her clothes, walks into the walk-in shower, and it shows her breasts and butt, that's all.Again, it may seem like they're going to show more than that, but they won'tIt all depends on your views.This scene isn't needed to get a trophy; you don't even have to go into her bathroom at ALL to beat that chapter.The 3rd scene, however, IS needed to get a trophy, seeing that there's something that happens after the fact, and depending on your actions, will earn a trophy.I won't say who, but you're given the choice to kiss a person, or not to kiss.If you kiss the person, then they'll start having some sex! xD But no, what they really do is start kissing, then lay on the floor. You'll have some INTERACTION with the scene, like to either unhook so and sos Bra, or to change position...The only nudity they show in this scene is so and sos Right breast, I'm not sure if they show any butt, but yeah...Depending on your views, this might be something to run home about. And I can say, it's kinda awkward if someone is watching you play, however, it does change the story/ending depending on which you choose. So, good luck with-a-THAT.There are a few bugs, such as during a movie scene where characters are talking to each other, and then some people that are walking around will just walk straight through the characters or any object, such as a desk or wall.I can say that it's really weird when it happens, but it's only a few times during the whole game, and ruins nothing at all.There are also some weird times where the characters facial expression doesn't quite match the situation...You'd know when you see it.It may sound like there are just bugs and problems at every which way, but it's only a few, and is spread out through the whole game, and by the time you encounter one, you'd have forgotten about the previous ones.(*5*) OVERALL - 10At the end of the day, I give this game a 10; because of how the story is told, and what the game makes you feel for the characters is just too realistic. And for a GAME to make me actually fear the outcome and possible regret of a situation is just wonderful. And even though I said the game gets a bit boring after the 3rd or so play through, this is still a game that should not be passed by. If like me, you'll connect to the characters. At first, I didn't like Norman Jayden, and had liked Ethan the most, but after I played it again, I started liking Norman more and more.This is an Action/Adventure, Drama, Mystery/Crime, and Romance.I really hope that this game has created a new genre of games, as I also loved Indigo Prophecy.There just aren't enough, if any, games like this, and have added Quantic Dreams to my list of favorite companies.I hope this review helped.
Medal of Honor: Underground is the second Medal of Honor game ever made.  It was released for the Sony Playstation in 2000.  While I believe certain things were changed for the worse and really don't think it's as good of a game overall compared to the original, it's a pretty awesome game anyway.Right from the very beginning of the game I notice the storyline is becoming more of a focus than ever before.  In the last game, you had the occasional cutscenes showing actual war footage from World War II, and in between were explanations from your female friend giving you important advice on exactly what you needed to do in order to complete the stages.  In this game, you ARE that female friend from the last game, going around doing lots of soldier shooting and completing objectives.  So your playable character is someone else.  Right there is an indication to me that the series is making small storyline progression steps.  Okay, not a HUGE deal or anything.Before starting the game, you'll notice in the Options menu there's a difficulty setting.  The game automatically has it set to Easy, and believe me, once you start the game you'll see why.  The stages are pretty tough and easy mode is the correct difficulty for a first-time playthrough.  To be completely honest, even on Easy mode this game is probably just as difficult as the last one, maybe even harder.  The first few stages feature guards that are probably just as tough as they were in stages 10 and 11 from the previous Medal of Honor game.  Yikes!If you put the game on Normal mode, you'll only have 50% energy at the beginning of each stage.  On Hard mode, the amount of energy you have left from the previous stage will carry over to the next stage  So yeah, PLAY THE GAME ON EASY!!!I had extremely mixed feelings once the game actually started up.  Why you ask?  Because the very first stage involves you finding your brother, and having you run directly behind him as he guides you through the rest of the level.  To me, that's a sign of a game searching for a storyline change.  While that's all fine and good, what made the original so great was how you were all alone on your missions and had to complete them by yourself.  It kind of bothers me how in the very first level you're supposd to let your brother do all the killing while you stand back and watch.  Of course, you can run past your brother and do all the killing yourself, but I'm not so sure that's a good idea.  The point I'm trying to make is that throwing other people into the game shows signs of the Medal of Honor series moving in a direction involving more focused storylines, and I'm not very fond of that because the series is supposed to be all about shooting, killing, and well, more shooting.Either way, once you complete level one, it seems the one-man army style from the previous game (well in this case, one-WOMAN army) has returned, which means, again it's just you by yourself exploring the stages and blasting guards, just like it was before.  In other words, just how it SHOULD be.It's harder to complete the objectives in this game compared to the original.  I'm not exactly sure why, but it might have something to do with the layout of the stages which feature slightly more narrow hallways and smaller passageways.  This makes it hard to see what's around the next corner soemtimes.  Don't worry though, the stages are about as long as they were before, maybe even longer.  But many times I'm finding in many situations you don't really have as much distance or freedom as you did before.  This means you might walk up to a guard unexpectedly and not even realize it.  Of course this means you will only have a split second to react.Once again, head shots are your best friend.  If you can manage to hit a guard in the head, he will probably fall over and die immediately.  The soldiers look pretty much exactly like they did in the first MoH game.  In fact, there's no changes at all as far as I can see.  They don't seem to be any harder to kill or anything, but they aren't afraid to unleash some mean, nasty weapons on you either!I don't like how this time around there's only a certain amount of ammo you can collect from each stage.  For example, in one stage I couldn't collect any more machine gun bullets because I had 300 bullets and couldn't go past that.  Things like that bother me a little.I'm kind of disappointed the bullets from those big machine guns attached to the ground that you occasionally stumbled upon in the last game are slower this time around.  Believe me, there's more guards in this game when you DO eventually find one of these machine guns, so because of the way the bullets fire slowly, you will probably get hit a lot more while trying to wipe out a group of guards.  I'm actually finding it easier to ignore these stationed machine guns completely and just pull out either MY machine gun, or something else.  It's easier and faster to kill with my weapons for some reason.Speaking of machine guns, what's up with the way your female playable character holds the machine gun in this game?  She holds it to the side like they do in the movies, I guess because it's supposed to look cool, haha.Load times are about the same.  It still takes 15 to 20 seconds to load a stage.  I don't mind it myself.  These stages are fun and exciting, so waiting a few seconds for them to load up isn't a problem for me personally.Loading your progress to a memory card is kind of strange.  Well, maybe it's because my memory card is almost full, but I can't get my file to appear at the very top.  I have to scroll down and search for it.  Also, maybe I'm seeing things, but the framerate doesn't feel quite as fast this time around.  I don't know, there seems to be an ever-so-slight reaction delay when you jump up in the air.  Everything else seems exactly like it was before, though.  You probably won't even notice.  Forget I said anything!Now with all that whining and negativity out of the way, let's talk about why I give the game a near-perfect rating.  The amount of creativity that was involved in making this game is unbelievable.  The level designs are outstanding.  This time around you have daytime stages while walking through sandy areas, and castle stages where you have to deal with guards hiding in armor (head shots will take care of them).  Some returning environments return from the last game such as the nighttime forest levels.  You have more of those in this game, not to mention more challenging ones.The stages are longer and more challenging this time around, because you have to eliminate moving trucks, army tanks and motorcycles.  This is not only a welcome addition for those of you only familiar with the original Medal of Honor, but also a welcome increase in challenge.  I love when I come across a big moving tank and have to find a way to get it to stop moving completely.  Because you're doing more than just running around blasting soldiers, this game can probably be considered more of a realistic wartime experience compared to the previous game.I'd say the stages this time around are more like mazes instead of straight-ahead "going from room to room" combat.  A good example is the one forest stage, where multiple paths are present and you have to find out which path leads to where.  You'll be spending more time figuring out where to go and killing soldiers along the way.  Overall, the stages feel longer this time around.The soundtrack is once again incredible.  You'll really feel like you're in the middle of a warzone for the entire time you're playing the game.Either way, this is one really exciting game.  Along with Quake II and the original Medal of Honor, this is the third best first-person shooter on the original Playstation.  An old game that's still worth playing over and over again.  The nonstop shooting action brings me back to it and glues me in every time.  Well that and the fact I like to improve my accuracy every time I play the game.  Those head shots are crucial not only for survival, but also to save on ammunition later on.  Remember that!

GRAPHICS: Certainly not the BEST graphics ever seen on a PS1 game, but you have to admit, this game looks a lot better than most other PS1 games. Even the explosion effects are nice to look at. No complaints here. However, the only complaint I have is the character models. For some reason, most of the characters don't seem to have faces, and in one cutscene, Gabe and Lian's pictures are on a news broadcast, and both of them look like a faceless Bonnie and Clyde. The problem with the faceless character models was remedied in SF3, though, but if you're like me, you won't care about the missing faces.GAMEPLAY: The physics engine is not a legendary make-up, but you won't find yourself complaining, either. Since this is 2004, people expect better from a game's physics engine, but this game was made during the PS1's final breaths, so of course it might feel a little...off. I haven't played the newest SF game &#34;The Omega Strain,&#34; but that game may prove these physics obsolete. Also, the targetting system of SF2 is perfect. You have two target modes...manual and auto fix target. Holding L1 down will switch you to 1st-Person View, and fix the green target reticle on what you want to shoot.Hold down R1 to automatically fix your target to nearby enemies. You will find that auto fix will be THE most commonly-used function. You also get an enormous selection of weapons to choose from. You'll only run across certain weapons at certain points, but if you access all weapons into your inventory at once, you will see there's enough guns to do your secret agent bidding. Even when you pick out a target, a small info tab will point to them, telling you what's happening with them. So, if you aim the target reticle at someone's head, the info tab will tell you you're about to make a headshot. Info tabs will also tell you if the enemy is wearing a Flak Jacket. This will force you to perform a headshot. There's also a multiplayer mode, but don't expect an iteration of GoldenEye or TimeSplitters. You and a friend are chucked into the playing field, and are forced to shoot each other for points. That's basically all the multiplayer is about, but you still might have a LITTLE fun doing it.SOUND: The sound is probably the best ear party you can possibly have. Shooting un-silenced .45s as others fire back practically sounds like a war.And don't complain about the music...at least it sounds better than SF3's quiet and unexciting tunes.STORY: Simply put, the Syphon Filter virus runs rampant for the second time around, and it's Gabe Logan's and Lian Xing's job to contain it. The game is long enough...it'll probably last you quite a few hours if you die a lot, but if you know what you're doing, it will certainly be no problem. There's also a lot of agent/spy talk, which contradicts how the actual CIA would work. Gamers who just play something to shoot something will probably be turned off by the dialogue in this game, but if you actually like listening to secret agents talk about shipments provided by the NSSOAA after NASDAQ collapsed in 2007, and the CIA requested a peace treaty with the Taliban (by the way, none of that ever happened in the game), then you'll be engulfed into the storyline and dialogue.

So, if you aim the target reticle at someone's head, the info tab will tell you you're about to make a headshot. Info tabs will also tell you if the enemy is wearing a Flak Jacket. This will force you to perform a headshot. There's also a multiplayer mode, but don't expect an iteration of GoldenEye or TimeSplitters. You and a friend are chucked into the playing field, and are forced to shoot each other for points. That's basically all the multiplayer is about, but you still might have a LITTLE fun doing it.SOUND: The sound is probably the best ear party you can possibly have. Shooting un-silenced .45s as others fire back practically sounds like a war.And don't complain about the music...at least it sounds better than SF3's quiet and unexciting tunes.STORY: Simply put, the Syphon Filter virus runs rampant for the second time around, and it's Gabe Logan's and Lian Xing's job to contain it. The game is long enough...it'll probably last you quite a few hours if you die a lot, but if you know what you're doing, it will certainly be no problem. There's also a lot of agent/spy talk, which contradicts how the actual CIA would work. Gamers who just play something to shoot something will probably be turned off by the dialogue in this game, but if you actually like listening to secret agents talk about shipments provided by the NSSOAA after NASDAQ collapsed in 2007, and the CIA requested a peace treaty with the Taliban (by the way, none of that ever happened in the game), then you'll be engulfed into the storyline and dialogue.
This is a review for the Playstation version of The World Is Not Enough.Unbelievable.  That's all I have to say after reading one negative review after another for this game.  I HIGHLY disagree with all the people who hate it.  Let's sort through all the reasons people put the game down, and see if they're actually true:- No multiplayer.  Big deal.  It wouldn't hurt anyone to play a game by themselves for a change.  Let's all bash Super Metroid too, because it's only one-player.  Give me a freakin' break.- Horrible play control.  WRONG!  It's *exactly* the same as Medal of Honor and Quake II.  Okay, sometimes when going around a turn you might get stuck on an imaginary object on the side of the hallway (and stop moving completely until you straighten yourself out) but I can seriously think of a bunch of games that are MUCH worse off than this.  Try Duke Nukem: Time to Kill for the ultimate example of "bad play control".  Leave this game alone, for crying out loud.  I can move Bond around through the game perfectly almost 100% of the time.  Even if it feels weird the first time controlling Bond in a first-person shooter, you'll adjust with time.- Weak animations from guards dying.  ANOTHER huge exaggeration.  NOT TRUE.  When you shoot and kill a guard in The World Is Not Enough, they actually copy some of the spectacular-looking animations from Medal of Honor.  How the heck can people criticize this?  I'm not sure.  Okay, sometimes the guards move around a little blocky, but what can you expect from a Playstation One game?  Besides, it feels like an arcade game this way.- Short levels, short game overall.  Yes, I can agree with this... to an extent.  But putting down a video game because of its length is overrated anyway, unless it's EXTREMELY short (like, if a game takes less than 1 hour to complete).  However, The World Is Not Enough takes at LEAST an hour and a half to finish.  Let's not forget about that darn blackjack game where you have to make $100,000 in order to progress to the next level.  It might take you a long time to win that much money.- Repetitive music.  This is a gigantic mystery to me.  Each of the 11 levels have at least four different theme songs (memorable ones, too).  It's not just ONE theme song throughout the entire game like so many reviewers seem to believe.  I have no idea what people are complaining about.  I really don't.- Having to sort through items and weapons.  This isn't a problem either.  There's two ways you can do this.  You can either hit the Square or Triangle buttons and skim through everything you have, or, for people who hate sorting through things, you can simply press the Start button and scroll down to where it says Inventory, and find what you're looking for right there (easily and conveniently).  There is not a single problem sorting through weapons in this game.- Too many unnecessary gadgets.  Not really true.  Everything you carry in your item list has a purpose.  Sometimes you might experience a bit of overkill when it comes to having to use some of these items on several occasions in order to finish a level (Level 5 especially) but other than that, it's not a big enough deal to complain about it.- Not enough shooting.  Again, not really true.  Sure, compared to Medal of Honor's 20-some levels filled with plenty of guards, this game probably feels a little empty.  Not comparing The World Is Not Enough to anything and just accepting it the way it is reveals a really good action-packed game.  You use stealth probably only two or three times in the entire game.  The rest of the time is spent shooting.You know something cool about this game nobody even mentions?  You have the option to PUNCH guards and knock them out if you run out of bullets.  I ran out of tranquilizer bullets in Level 5 for example, and had an absolute blast going around punching everyone to death.  This is a nice extra touch to an already above average game.Like I said to a friend the other day- the only reason people are bashing this game is because it's not at the same level of brilliance as Goldeneye on the N64.  Big deal.  Do you really think it's possible to surpass such an awesome game?  Yeah it's possible, but it hasn't happened that much, I can tell you that.  Only about 10 games in the last seven years managed to surpass Goldeneye's amazing gameplay.  The World Is Not Enough was never intended to be "the number one most influential game".  It was intended to satisfy fans of Bond games and fans of first-person shooters and in that respect, the game works just fine.The variety of levels in this game is, for the most part, pretty good.  It's surprising to me that the very first level requires you to quietly move around guards and cameras and NOT be seen by them.  Most games start off with a basic shooting level.  Not this game.  However, your urge to shoot everything you see will come in handy as soon as Level 2.  You will be shooting guards left and right, and the guns you can carry are really spectacular to watch, and effective on dangerous guards.  There's a nice selection of guns overall.The games difficulty ranges from really easy and short (Levels 1 and 2) to EXTREMELY hard (the last two levels of the game).  The only inconsistent level in the game would be Level 3, because the end of that level is pretty tough.  This is the skiing level.  By the way, this is actually a pretty fun level.  It's not mindlessly going down a snowy hill like some people will try and tell you- you have to ski the right way in order to collect bullets that are located on the ground, and while doing this, you have to either shoot or dodge guards who are hiding behind crates.  Not mindless at all.I love this game.  I don't know what's wrong with the people who hate it.  You really have to stop comparing everything to Goldeneye.  Time to move on.  The only possible problem I can find with this game is when you reach the end of a level, and the final obstacle isn't always clear what you have to do.  You can find those answers on the internet though, so it's not a big deal.  Great game.  I'm glad I own it.

I bought this game at a EB store. It was one of the most interesting civ games I have ever played. It had verry good game concpts and I played for hours on end. And that was about 7 to 10 years ago. I still remeber playing it. But then again I like all civ games. It got 4 stars over all. But I only got 3 stars of fun out of it. I finaly got burnt out on it and traded it. And I have nothing but good memories from playing it. Planting forest and reaserching biomorphic fugi. And the wierd mind worms which took the place of barbains. Differnt factions such as chairman yang of the hive and more cool stuff.

For the past few years I have been playing Sega's (now ESPN)series of football games and just loved them. This year, I got Sega's offering, that was dirt cheap and it was OK. I'm not into the "crib" scene, but gameplay was great like in previous years. I saw a promo for getting a discount on a wireless remote when you bought Madden 2005 when it came out and went for it. After getting used to the differences, I have become addicted. I have started in Franchise mode and also done the fantasy draft. After playing several "seasons", I now look forward to the owner off-season mode as much as playing games. It gives you insight into the game, the combine, free agency, etc. ESPN's football game goes overboard in owner mode. I don't want to go through a massive menu and decide what kind of workout my defensive backs have this week. I would much rather shop around my baggage for what my team needs (in Madden). I think that Madden's graphics look better. I actually tried playing my Sega game last week and am so used to Madden that I stopped after a couple minutes.There are things I wish Madden stole from ESPN/SEGA...a half time show, a weekly wrapup show, more realistic penalties. I have been playing this game a ton and have NEVER seen a pass interference call. Hopefully, some of this will be addressed in the 2006 offering. They may start to slack though since the NFL Players Assoc has signed an exclusive agreement with Madden, therefore squashing all competition.

The wait for this game was not fun.Buffy was originally going to come out in the fall of 2000. It was going to debut on the Dreamcast, the Playstation, and PC. I (A die-hard Buffy fan) waited patiently and ran to the store on the original release date to find nothing. I looked the game up on-line and I learned it would come out in January of 2001 so I ran out again to find nothing. I learned that July that Buffy was going to come out on the X-box so I bought the system two or three months after it (the system) came out. I went to the stores in may of 2002 (the release date) only to learn that it was once again pushed back until August.I have to say that the day the game came out was a huge pay-off.Buffy came out two years after the original release date but it was well worth it. What a great game! The controls were good the graphics were excellent and the story was good. This game is like a lost episode of the series. I would give this game five stars if the last couple of puzzle levels weren't so hard. This game can be really hard at times but it's worth the price and it's worth your time if you give it a chance.

I bought a PS Vita after years of playing multiplayer shooter games. Call it old age, slow reflexes, or just plain tired of getting killed all the time. I dug out my old PSP and started playing some of the games I had that I never finsihed like God of War and Metal Gear. I found them so much more relaxing than the multiplayer experience. Then I starting reading about the PS Vita. I decided to get one when they included the $50 GC with the purchase, also my wife wanted to get me a Father's Day gift. Anyway I bought Resistance and Uncharted. Resistance was okay but when I started playing Uncharted, I was hooked. This game is the ultimate game for the Vita. The graphics are awesome. The game play is captivating and as always with the Uncharted series, the story is phenominal and intriguing, playing like a mystery movie. If you have a Vita, you owe it to yourself to give this game a try. I am sure you will enjoy it.6/19 Update - I have finished the game and except for a few parts where the third person view makes things hard to figure out the controls, this game is just plain awesome. The ending gives you the feeling you get when you watched a five star movie. Order it, play it, and enjoy! I have been gaming for many years and you will be very hard pressed to find a better game than this.
If you buy one RPG this year make sure it's Dragon Age: Origins.I spent about 25 to 35 hours for a full playthrough.  It was time well spent.  I bought the game for 34.99 at Amazon.com on black Friday 2009 so I did get a great deal because the game MSRP is 59.99.  If you like RPG's and like Dungeons and Dragons this game is a must buy.  If you're unsure about the genre wait for a price drop to about 39.99.STORY. 8/10.  Well thought out campaign and mildly interesting plot.GRAPHICS 6/10  The graphics are inspired yet ultimately average.GAMEPLAY 9/10  The core game mechanics are rock solid and the level design and controls are spot on.VALUE  9/10  Six separate campaigns, an average 25 hour playthrough equals about 200 hours of game. My measure of a good buy is that a purchase should net about a 1.00 per hour of game. I got a 1.00 per hour on my first playthrough. :]  Downloadable content is sure to happen and some is included with DA:O if you purchase before June 2010.OVERALL  8/10  It is a niche genre and is not for everyone.  If your an RPG aficianado then give it a 9/10.  If you pick it up under 29.99 it's a 9.5.  If you can find it under 19.99 it's a perfect 10.
This game is more like a movie that you somewhat control along the way as it's mostly comprised of quick time events where you have to press buttons in a certain sequence quickly.  Don't let this turn you off though like it did me originally.  I picked this up years after release for cheap and glad I did, it was an amazing experience.  I got it on a Friday and played it all weekend and finished the story.  I did end up trading the game in just this past weekend because to me it didn't have any replay value though to some it will as it does have multiple endings.  I definitely got my money's worth though as I got the same amount back in credit that I bought it for.  I'd recommend it to anybody at it's current price.
This is one of the greatest games i have ever played. And has won a reward in my book as "The most addictive game ever". Let me start with the hard drive is remarkable it makes online gameing so fast and is now working with most of the new games now. It comes preinstalled with the Playonline and Final Fantasy XI game. Final Fantasy XI is a trumph in video game history, the comunity traits and the overall package is enough to make ONE spend the rest of his life on the game. The playonline is also a great server system, giving chat room systems to anyone and tetra card to those who spend a dollar to play a month. This is a great package all to gether and is well worth the money for the price, heck ill spend twice the price for the system ITS THAT GOOD trust me you will not be dis apointed.

Almost everyone has at least heard of this game. It doesn't matter if you're obsessed with videogames, just a casual fan, or don't play videogames at all: the God of War series is just one of those trilogies that demands the respect or recognition of all gamers... who are somewhere around 18 years old. Using Greek mythology as a basis for its unique story, similarly to the movie Clash of the Titans, God of War puts players into the sandals of Kratos, a Spartan warrior with incredible strength and a temper to match who slays almost every mythological figure he comes across; whether it's a person or a monster, there's literally a 90% chance Kratos will kill them. When the game starts, it does so without any overly long building up or dragging out. From the main menu you can see the side of Kratos's face (mostly his silhouette) amidst a background of flames. Once you press start, the flames fade away and the camera shows Kratos's entire face and he sadly speaks: "The gods of Olympus have abandoned me." You then see that he is atop an enormous cliff, which he steps off of and plummets towards the waters of the Aegean Sea below him. The game then wastes no time with the action and goes back three weeks to when Kratos, in the service of the gods, is in a large shipwreck in the very same ocean doing battle with undead warriors, harpies, and a multi-headed Hydra. In what ends up becoming the trademark of the God of War series, this game sort of starts you off battling a boss, the Hydra, although at first you fight only a couple of its heads as you guide Kratos through the wreckage of several ships the Hydra destroyed, with many of the passengers being slaughtered en masse. When Kratos finally reaches the master head of the Hydra, the game shows off its graphical and technical superiority: the master head of the Hydra is GIGANTIC with sharp teeth and an intimidating roar. Kratos appears about the size of a Polly Pocket figure in comparison to this monster. When Kratos shows he is a match for this creature and proceeds to punish it with his chained blades, the Blades of Chaos, you begin to see how Kratos is truly one tough customer.Afterwards, Kratos is tasked by Athena, the goddess of wisdom, to destroy her brother Ares, the titular god of war, and save her city of Athens from being destroyed by him and his army. Kratos appears to have some past history with Ares and gladly accepts the mission in return for the gods removing the nightmares and memories that haunt Kratos every day and night; memories consisting of him slaughtering countless men and women. Kratos then begins his journey to slay Ares and his minions, traveling great distances through many detailed and varied environments such as the streets of Athens, the Desert of Lost Souls, and Pandora's Temple. During his journey, we find out more about Kratos's past, and the way the game slowly reveals his past through flashbacks with beautifully detailed CGI cutscenes is nothing short of amazing. These scenes are narrated by an unseen elderly woman, giving the scenes and the game in general a storytelling element that immediately grips the player and immerses them into the epic mythos of the game. It's also (mostly) through these cutscenes that we see just how well Kratos defines the term "anti-hero". Make no mistake, while Kratos is the protagonist of the game, he is by no means a "good guy" or "hero". In any other tale, he could easily be the villain.However, this game is more than just pretty graphics and an interesting tale. Most of it is in your face, relentless, bloody, and challenging action. As I previously mentioned, Kratos battles every kind of mythological creature ever spawned like minotaurs, centaurs, cyclopses, Medusa, and much more. With his main weapons, the fire imbued Blades of Chaos, Kratos can defeat most enemies just with the very effective combos available to him with these blades, mostly through combinations of light and heavy attacks. The blades can be upgraded for extra power and effectiveness as you defeat enemies. Kratos also acquires upgradeable magical abilities from the gods such as throwing Zeus's lightning bolts (Zeus's Fury), surrounding himself with a field of lightning (Poseidon's Rage), turning his enemies into stone with the head of Medusa (Medusa's Gaze), and summoning the souls of the dead (Army of Hades). He also acquires another weapon, the Blade of Artemis, which is slow and has a shorter reach than the Blades of Chaos, but does more damage per swing. The Blades of Chaos also eventually grant Kratos with the Rage of the Gods, where a bolt of lightning strikes Kratos and he is energized with the electrical energy. In this state his attacks do far greater damage and he takes much less damage from enemy attacks. It's best to save this move for a couple of the game's more difficult set-pieces and boss battles. One particular set-piece where Kratos undergoes a seemingly endless battle with a bunch of three headed Cerberus hounds proves to be one of the most difficult battles in the entire series and demands smart use of magic and Rage of the Gods. When surrounded by enemies, knowing when to attack, block/parry, or dodge attacks is key to surviving. That's what's so great about this game's combat: it's challenging, but also accessible and easy even for newbies to set up a good rhythm. Another way Kratos can do away with his enemies is by grabbing them once they've been weakened and then one of many quick time events will occur. You'll have to either press one of the four face buttons when prompted to do so, twist the analog sticks, or jam on the cirlce (grab) button so Kratos can brutally dismember his enemies: he'll twist off heads, yank off arms, behead enemies with their own weapons, rip them in half... whatever you can picture in your darkest thoughts, Kratos can do it.Other times, button prompts pop up requiring you to jam on a button simply to lift up a gate or push over a huge statue. The QTEs also come into play when Kratos battles the bosses in this game, and successfully completing them does great damage to the bosses (or kills them). This game perfected the use of QTEs: they give you just enough time to react and you usually only suffer moderate damage should you miss a step, but you still have to be on your toes if you want to survive. There are only three bosses in the game, but they're all huge and offer decent challenges, especially the final boss. The game has many puzzles to test the player's wit as well, and most of them are reasonably challenging. Some may take a while to figure out, like knowing in which order to turn several levers to activate some other machine. Others involve just being very quick, like pushing a large block across the floor and climbing onto it to reach a higher ledge before spikes shoot up from the floor and instantly kill Kratos. Still others require that Kratos sacrifice a person to please the gods, and he has no qualms about doing such a thing if it helps him in his quest to kill Ares (told you he wasn't a good guy). Overall, the game's combat and puzzles are challenging, but not quite to such an infuriating degree as games like Devil May Cry 3. I'm sure it's pretty obvious to you by now that this game has a very high level of blood and gore, but it also has several instances of nudity and sexual situations that actually reinforce the overall authenticity of the game's Greek myth backdrop... just don't play this game in front of children or family members if you want to avoid having a very awkward moment. This game has great graphics, challenging enemies and puzzles, an epic story, and top-notch gameplay and controls. Not to mention the incredible music, with lots of well sung orchestral scores that fit the game very well and further enhance its epicness. Get this game if you haven't already.

Overall, the game's combat and puzzles are challenging, but not quite to such an infuriating degree as games like Devil May Cry 3. I'm sure it's pretty obvious to you by now that this game has a very high level of blood and gore, but it also has several instances of nudity and sexual situations that actually reinforce the overall authenticity of the game's Greek myth backdrop... just don't play this game in front of children or family members if you want to avoid having a very awkward moment. This game has great graphics, challenging enemies and puzzles, an epic story, and top-notch gameplay and controls. Not to mention the incredible music, with lots of well sung orchestral scores that fit the game very well and further enhance its epicness. Get this game if you haven't already.
That's what I've started doing.  It's a game that drips testosterone from marble columns of Athens to (but not quenching) the infernals of Hades.  There's not much happy in Krato's Ancient Greece.  Well, strike that.  Maybe Aries is happy because he's ripping Athens to shreds.  Fires, thunderstorms, Aries' steel clanging, while the helpless humans fire arrows at the God of War unleashed.  Pah!  Human Arrows.  It's like trying to put out Hades' flames by blowing bubbles.There is so much amazing about God of War.  First, I'll talk about thought.  There's folly about.  That's the theme of Greek Mythology, ALWAYS.  Folly between the gods and "their human playthings".  However, Greek gods are flawed just like the human pawns.  For the gods of Olympus err clumbsiness then clean-up their mistakes after.  What folly!  God of War WORKS as Greek Mythology.  I love the concept of "destroying a god" through Pandora's Box.  Opening Pandora's Box, the colloquialism, is to unleash a maelstrom of unpredictable chaotic events.  Is that what happens when a god is killed?  Absolutely.  This is what I mean regarding thought.  There are philosphical gems that glisten in Ancient Greece.Second, the gameplay and controls are extremely tight.  You'll use every button on the contoller when battling.  You'll use every move.  Rolling/evasion, blocking, comboes that can rise to triple digit numbers (my highest is 124) are necessary to avoid becoming burger to Aries' black-hearted baddies.  This said, tight controls are necessary, work perfect, creating some ridiculously fast paced/intense action.Third, is balance.  Now some friends say I smoke too much over drinking, but I understand balance is required.  God of War balances action and puzzle solving, and not once do the scales dip to one side.  Sure, the game gets difficult and frustrating the further you take Kratos, but never is there too much fighting, too much puzzle-solving, or too much drinking.  Wah?  The balance is great.Did I mention level design?  No?  It's brilliant.  Sometimes it reminds me of Prince of Persia:SOT and sometimes Tomb Raider.  Environments are very fluid, from the details of statues and Greek architecture, to Kratos' ugly reflection on a highly polished floor?  I'd hate to be the sap who keeps those Greek floors so spickitty span clean.  I wonder what that dude makes an hour.  Benefits are worth it, especially if you get to glimpse the Oracle of Athens in her sheer top.  Huh?  Great level design.To add one more edge on Kratos already sharp blades, God of War has a wonderful soundtrack.  The music is ambiant sometimes, orchestral at others.  Should I say it again?  Ok.  Balanced soundtrack.I'll wrap it up.  My wife came down when I was playing and she said, "Honey, why do you have your shirt off?"  I looked at her.  My eyes were bloodshot but not from God of War.  I replied, "Kratos doesn't wear a shirt.  If he doesn't, I don't."

"God of War," complete with its intense, action-packed gameplay, amazing visuals and production values, a fascinating anti-hero, and one of the best stories ever to grace a video game, is easily among the best titles you'll play this year on the Playstation 2 - if not ever. Indeed, if the Playstation 3 were to launch tomorrow, there would be no better send-off for its predecessor than this.The game takes ancient Greece and its mythologies for an ingenious spin, transforming "Clash of the Titans" into a bleak, Robert E. Howard gloomfest complete with unrelenting violence and a mood that is downright oppressive. This is certainly not the Greek mythology you learned about back in grade school, and your guide through this austere world of scheming gods and defiant mortals is none other than Kratos, a shameless killer who delights in gushing red blood and being where battle is thickest. He certainly has a chip on his shoulder, and it may or may not have to do with his absent wife and child, and the god of war himself - Ares. The basic concept is revenge, a mortal in opposition to a deity and all the monsters you can shake a sword at, but the plotline that drives "God of War" is far more interesting than that, and is gradually unraveled in splendid fashion. Suffice it to say that both the setting and Kratos, the player character, are as imaginative as they come. This one, like a great movie, sucks you in and, once it has you, doesn't let go.With such an interesting story and world already established, the developers of "God of War" could have churned out a half-baked action-adventure and still been a step ahead of many of their peers, but thankfully, not content to do this, they made "God of War" the absolute best game of its kind. It's an out and out ass-kicker, reminiscent of the recent "Prince of Persia" games (particularly "Warrior Within" and its Mature rating) and 2002's "Rygar" redux, but with action forefront and devious traps falling in behind. Comparisons aside, "God of War" is its own game through and through - a rewarding combination of reflex and gray matter, with an emphasis on the former.Kratos takes on all comers with a set of short swords, each one lashed to a binding chain and seared into his tormented flesh. That is, at least, during the early portion of the game prior to the introduction of the Blade of Artemis (essentially a gigantic scimitar), but these weapons will, almost undoubtedly, be the ones with which you become most familiar, and given the lack of variety it's great that they prove to be so much fun. In conjunction with some very capable magical powers bestowed upon Kratos by the gods as the game proceeds, these default weapons are more than sufficient, with the aforementioned secondary sword stepping in as a mere bonus. Admittedly, combat in the game initially feels like something that will wear thin, but thanks to the game's upgrade options, which allow you to beef up your spells and weapons by conquering your enemies, new combos and deadlier effects can be attained and unleashed, keeping things fresh.Unlike most action-adventures of this type, "God of War" seems all but immune to the usual monotonies of this genre, and not only because of the aforementioned combos, spells, and upgrades. The game's levels can take most of the blame, as they are very well-designed, complete with new challenges at virtually every turn. Aesthetically, each one is diverse, even down to its color scheme. And while some settings are clearly more polished than others, even at their worst these graphics rival anything available on the PS2. At their best, on the other hand, they're astounding, rising in artistry above virtually anything ever committed to a console. That all of this is done on the aging hardware of the Playstation 2 makes it that much more amazing.The characters come off nearly as good as the environments. Kratos looks suitably imposing and mean, and the spin on Greek monsters and myths takes a decidedly horrific turn with the motley collection of centaurs, minotaurs, and harpies that stand in his way. Boss encounters are few and far between in the game, but of the three that exist each is memorable, challenging, and beautiful to look at. The same pervading sense of quality pretty much shines throughout "God of War."But of course nothing is perfect, and the same is true here. One level, set in Hades, goes above and beyond in terms of frustration, temporarily emphasizing platforming in a game that, before, had little to do with such antics. Likewise, some of the reflex-testing minigames required to take down the game's boss monsters, usually optionally associated with gory finishing moves on lesser beasts, can be difficult to pull off in time, and make for some needless aggravation. As an elective edge in combat they would have fared better, instead of being necessary to prevail. On the other hand, this concept is a novel one, and when it works it works beautifully - but it has its downsides, especially during the final confrontation with Ares.Some may find "God of War" to be too difficult, as it's certainly not a game that's easy to breeze through. I think, for the most part, however, that it strikes a fine balance. From beginning to end, "God of War" is truly epic in scope, like a big budget Hollywood adventure, complete with the finest production values available. The more you play, the harder it is to stop. This is action-adventure near its pinnacle, the game that was promised and finally delivered. "God of War" is a great game with a great main character in a great stylized setting. What more can be said of it?

A long time ago I picked up a role-playing game at Gen Con titled "Abyss" which was a reimagining of "Dante's Inferno" on steroids. It was gloriously violent, decadent, and imaginative.  When the Open Game License was released for Dungeons & Dragons came out, I was convinced this was the chance for "Abyss" to triumphantly return and, after tracking down the license holder and a publisher, wrote an entire book for the game.  But then the 4th Edition of D&D; was released and the publisher's interest waned. "Dante's Inferno," the video game by Visceral Games, is what I imagine that tabletop game would have looked like.When I completed my manuscript I sent it to my cousin, arenowned scholar)on "Dante's Inferno."  He demurred criticism, explaining that he had never played a video game before (it was a tabletop game remember) but that he appreciated the effort.  I imagine that's the response most people familiar with Dante Alighieri's "The Divine Comedy" will feel about this game: it's not very accurate, but if the kids are interested in literature that's a good thing, right?In the video game, Dante Alighieri (Graham McTavish) is transformed from an Italian poet to a Templar Knight on the Third Crusade. A deeply flawed warrior, he manages to break his vow to Beatrice (Vanessa Branch) before slaughtering Muslim prisoners of war at the city of Acre.  Sin and death surrounds Dante, from his doomed fellow crusader and brother-in-law Francesco (Tom Tate) to his brutal father Alighiero (JB Blanc) to his forlorn mother Bella (Pollyana McIntosh).  Dante's disillusionment is central to the belief that as a Templar his soul is untouched by the murders he commits - it is a credit to "Dante's Inferno" that it takes on such weighty matters as the Papal Bull of the Crusade. But Dante is one tough mother, so when he is stabbed in the back and death comes for him, Dante wrestles the Geiger-like scythe from him and proceeds on a quest to return to Beatrice...only to discover that Satan has absconded with her soul into hell.  Thus begins Dante's descent, accompanied only by the poet Virgil (Bart McCarthy).And that's the part we've all been waiting for: fighting in literature's most infamous hellscape. The nine circles of hell are lovingly (hatefully?) inspired by Hieronymous Bosch and other medieval artists: ferrying with Charon, battling Minos, resisting Cleopatra, slaying the many-mouthed Cerberus, facing his father's greed, and overcoming the gigantic fire demon Phlegyas.It's impossible not to learn about the original text by playing "Dante's Inferno" - a quote flies at you every time you die.  There are a variety of damned souls throughout that can be saved or condemned through mini-games which in turn gives you new powers, all of them drawn from the poem.  You can't help but admire a game that's willing to teach you a piece of classic literature even as you beat it up.There are a lot of flourishes in "Dante's Inferno" that have nothing to do with the poem and everything to do with its predecessors, "Devil May Cry" and "God of War," from the big honking scythe to the fact that Dante can fight for up to ten seconds in mid-air, from the completely unnecessary tassels that dangle from his arms to the power-ups that reward you for button mashing.  This is a game where strategy is not so much rewarded as beaten out of you. And yet "Dante's Inferno" is also a jumping, puzzling game, brutally uncompromising in sending Dante to his doom.  The medium difficulty is just about right for fighting but makes many of the other challenges too hard; the easy setting makes the various puzzles surmountable but the fighting too easy.By the sixth circle the creative team behind "Dante's Inferno" seems to have run out of steam.  Whereas in the previous circles we were gifted with whirling two-headed demons that spilled gold, corrupt infants with blades for hands, moaning temptresses with tentacles unfurling from their abdomens, and shuddering behemoths of disgusting filth, the sixth circle just starts repeating itself.  We get horned demons, then horned demons with axe and shield, and then horned demons with wings and two swords that can turn into flames.  The eighth circle with its ten "bolgie" is the worst, as a narrator explains the sinners and sins rather than actually showing them - after spending hours with wailing corpses flailing, boiling, and skewered, it's obvious the design team ran out of ideas and budget. Things don't pick up again until the last circle, when you face down Satan himself.  Compared to earlier battles, the final fight was a cakewalk.The end of "Dante's Inferno" isn't the end of course - in the game or in the poem - but it will be interesting to see if Visceral Games can make Purgatory just as compelling.
The PlayStation 2 got a decent dose of bloody Roman history earlier this year with Shadow of Rome, a more or less playable version of the movie Gladiator. However, Sony has completely upped the ante with God of War, an adventure of Herculean proportions that brilliantly plays off Greek mythology and delivers one of the most intense gaming experiences of the year.The game's premise is as ancient as the mythos itself: Ares, the titular deity with serious self-esteem issues, has gone on a rampage and must be stopped. Being Greek gods (who are prone to sit on their eternal asses and empower others to do their dirty work), a mortal dutifully takes up the task: Kratos, a tortured Spartan warrior who can pry off Gorgon heads, tear some enemies completely in half, and perform other super-human feats. Formidable as Kratos' strength is, the only thing that can kill Ares is Pandora's Box, an artifact resting behind a series of bosses, devilishly constructed traps, and perplexing puzzles (most of which come in the form of moving objects and pulling levers).Borrowing perhaps a bit too liberally from Devil May Cry (the first one, anyway), Kratos is a serious-minded one-man slaughterhouse, sans the oh-so-cool swagger. Equipped with a pair of extending chains each capped with a sword, the Spartan uses these weapons for mid-range combo attacks, including vicious air-juggles. Larger foes, though, require more skill, and some must be softened up before they can be finished off by a series of onscreen button-press cues. Additional combos are unlocked by cashing in dead souls collected from felled enemies. Accessory weapons are also available. For instance, once you wrench off Medusa's head, it can be used as a power-up to temporarily petrify enemies that can then be shattered if struck before they can thaw. The gods chime in, too, and dole out various devastating powers, such as Zeus' lightning bolts and Hades' dead souls.Robust fighting engine aside, God of War draws additional strength from the sheer diversity of tasks to be completed and the clever way it plays off the source material. Classic monsters, such as the Hydra, Minotaur, Sirens, and Harpies (among others) require specific techniques in order to defeat as the events take place against a driving music score reminiscent of the best Roman movie sagas like Ben-Hur. The excellent visuals bring these foes to life and the detailed architecture deliver the aesthetic punch of an era long gone.All is not perfect on Olympus, though. The inconsistent camera (that destroyer of other games) takes its toll as it makes seemingly simple tasks like navigating lengthy catwalks more perilous than it should be, and some of the puzzles rely excessively on split-second timing and result in repetitive trial-and-error.Setbacks aside, God of War is an exhausting, epic quest that challenges the mightiest video game warrior from the throne of their living-room couch.

God of War has the distinction of being one of the (many) early contenders for Game of the Year. Even being released at a time packed with other fantastic games (Devil May Cry 3, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, Resident Evil 4, Jade Empire), God of War manages to make a lasting mark on the action/adventure genre.The story of God of War is one pieced together from and inspired by Greek mythology. Olympus, the home of the gods, is in chaos. Ares, the god of war, has declared. . . well, war on his bretheren, wreaking havoc against his sister, Athena's, capital city. With Athens burning and a decree from Zeus himself that the gods cannot take direct action against Ares, his brothers and sisters turn to a fallen hero, a tortured soul who wants nothing more than to destroy Ares for his own reasons.Stepping into the sandals of a half-god Spartan general named Kratos, the player is immediately introduced to some of the most fluid, brutal, cinematic, and rewarding combat of any game this generation. Instead of the "dial-a-combo" style of combat used in action games like Ninja Gaiden, God of War offers the players a set of fairly simple moves, and the ability to string them together in a myriad of ways for near-endless strings of combos. The blades that Kratos uses (gruesome swords literally chained to his arms) whirl through the air to slice into enemies, plunge through flesh, or hurl them into the air.In fact, the over-the-top violence of God of War is something to note; it doesn't share the comical/sattirical nature of the mayhem in the Grand Theft Auto games, and it pulls NO punches; there are even scenes of nudity and suggested (well, more like heard-but-not-seen) sexual content. However, the game is one of a brutal story set in a brutal world about a VERY brutal main character, so it fits the mood and themes.The game also strives to create a very visceral and cinematic experience for every minute that the player is in control, allowing the player brutal finishing moves to decapitale, eviscerate, and dismember his enemies. Likewise, through properly-timed button presses, Kratos can scale enormous bosses and deliver crushing and stylized blows to specific body parts to bring them down. One particularly memorably moment is the fight against the three-headed dragon from Greek mythology, the Hydra, who the players must destroy using an etire ship as a weapon.Along with the compelling story (told through the excellent in-game engine as well as through stunning Full Motion Video scenes) and the brutal and easily adaptable combat, the game features some solid puzzles when it switches from burning city battlefields to ancient dunegons and temples. For the most part, these challenges will be very familiar to anyone who has played the Legend of Zelda series, but God of War adds its signature dark twist to these (you'll find yourself using Medusa's head to turn enemies to stone and place them on pressure switches).However, it's also in these dungeons that the game shows it's one (very minor) Achille's heel. The fact that Kratos, a half-god with the power to bring down a Titan, can be easily killed by a simple swinging blade is fairly annoying; and the platforming (involving said blades), is the game's weakest part. It's not horrible, but it doesn't quite show the same level of polish and quality as the rest of the title. Platforming is also the only time you'll see the graphics falter. Easily one of the best-looking games on the PS2, GoW's only problem is a slight awkard animation when Kratos jumps (especially when compared to the animation in titles like the recent Prince of Persia games).However, these are VERY small faults in a VERY good game. The title has excellent replay value, with multiple difficulty levels, unlockables, special "making the game" features, and a quest that will take at least 10-15 hours for even hardcore gamers to play through once (and you'll want to play this one multiple times).Overall, if you're looking for a magnificent and hard-hitting action game experience with a good share of head-scratching bits as well, you can't go wrong with God of War. Just keep this one away from the kids.

A year after the out-of-the-blue sucess of Def Jam Vendetta, EA Games releases, Def Jam Fight For NY, with similiar results. Def Jam Fight For NY is an excellent wrestling game with tons of replay value, and a cool hip-hop influenced storyline to boot.Notice how I referred to the game as a "wrestling" game? Unlike the game suggests, Def Jam Fight For NY is predominantly a WRESTLING game. The fighting system is based upon performing grapples and simple strikes, and performing combos and special moves. With so many moves to choose from and unlock, the fighting system is suprisingly deep, but the fights get just a bit repetitive after a while.Def Jam Fight For NY story mode begins when D-Mob is being taken away by the boys in blue, when suddenly, a mysterious car topples the police cruiser and allows D-Mob to escape. The driver of the mysterious car, as you soon learn, is you, and you then create the appearance of your character using a police composite sketch, a pretty clever way to create your character. D-Mob then asks you to join their force of fighters to try and take over the whole fighting circuit of the city.There are over 40 Def Jam labelmates appearing in the game, all appearing fighters in the game. Snoop Dogg, the Top Dogg (naturally) of the opposing gang, with Busta Rhymes, Fat Joe and many others on his side, while your crew consists of the likes of Method Man, Redman and a few others. As the story progresses and you win fights, you can earn cash to spend on new clothes for your character, supplied by urban name-brands like Sean John, State Property, Joker, Enyce, and Ecko to name a few, new hairstyles for you character, tattoos, shoes, and many other accessories for you character to rock, and of course, there are many others to unlock as you progress through the story.The story mode is long and deep, with a compelling story complete with story twists, and takes a lengthy 8 hours of play to complete. Of course, once you beat the story mode, you'll be coming back for more. As usual, there are many hip-hop tunes included in the game, courtesy of Def Jam of course, and multiplayer action is also included. Fans of wrestling, wrestling games, or hip-hop would find this game very appealing.
A year after the out-of-the-blue sucess of Def Jam Vendetta, EA Games releases, Def Jam Fight For NY, with similiar results. Def Jam Fight For NY is an excellent wrestling game with tons of replay value, and a cool hip-hop influenced storyline to boot.Notice how I referred to the game as a "wrestling" game? Unlike the game suggests, Def Jam Fight For NY is predominantly a WRESTLING game. The fighting system is based upon performing grapples and simple strikes, and performing combos and special moves. With so many moves to choose from and unlock, the fighting system is suprisingly deep, but the fights get just a bit repetitive after a while.Def Jam Fight For NY story mode begins when D-Mob is being taken away by the boys in blue, when suddenly, a mysterious car topples the police cruiser and allows D-Mob to escape. The driver of the mysterious car, as you soon learn, is you, and you then create the appearance of your character using a police composite sketch, a pretty clever way to create your character. D-Mob then asks you to join their force of fighters to try and take over the whole fighting circuit of the city.There are over 40 Def Jam labelmates appearing in the game, all appearing fighters in the game. Snoop Dogg, the Top Dogg (naturally) of the opposing gang, with Busta Rhymes, Fat Joe and many others on his side, while your crew consists of the likes of Method Man, Redman and a few others.

Ok, Bond fans, it's happened. 007: Everything or Nothing (EoN) is simply the best Bond game to date. Previous Bond games attempted to emulate the success of the n64's Goldeneye, and all of them inevitably fell short. EoN does not do this. It tries something completely new, and this is why it succeeds.EoN drops the first-person shooter mold and gives gamers a third-person perspective a la Splinter Cell. Now, we get to actually see Bond in action. This adds an entirely new aspect to the game, and stealth plays a bigger role than ever before. Also, Bond has been given a new set of hand-to-hand combat moves, but let's face it, why bother with the hand-to-hand combat when you can easily accumulate head shots with your PP7 and Bond's auto-aim locking button? The auto-aim has the ups and downs of any typical third-person videogame. Sometimes you find yourself locking on the wrong guy as someone two feet to your right opens up on you with a machinegun. You just learn to deal with it.Like the last 007 game, Nightfire, EoN does everything it can to get you to feel as if you're playing in a James Bond film. You put in the game, press power, and James Bond shoots at the camera. Then the game drops you off in a pre-credit sequence. Upon completion, EoN launches into credits and its theme song, sung by Mya. EoN takes it to the next level by having all the characters in the game modeled after and voiced by real-life popular actors including Pierce Brosnan, Willem Dafoe (as the villian), and Shannon Elizabeth. The Willem Dafoe character even has ties with an old Bond villian, Max Zorin from "A View to a Kill." The old henchman, JAWS, also is invited to the party, and before you know it, you're going toe-to-toe with JAWS in a high-speed train! The extra effort by EA to make this seem like a Bond movie really pays off.There's a lot to do in the game, and the variety of gameplay is unparalleled in any Bond game to date. In one level you find yourself in a car race; in another, you're jumping off a cliff to rescue a falling damsel in distress; and in yet another, you're on your motorcyle dodging exploding canisters on the interstate. Let's not forget that Bond also manages to pilot a helicopter in one level and a tank in another. Oh yeah, and what about Bond's Aston Martin? That shows up, too. There's plenty to do in this Bond game, enough to make it worth your ever precious dollars. The vehicle levels are all improved from previous Bond entries.The replay value is high as well. There are plenty of things to unlock, including new levels, cheats, and modes of gameplay (including an Arena mode). There are multiple options for multi-player. Besides Arena, there is a multi-player Co-op mode where you choose from different Mi:6 agents and go through chapters specifically created for the Co-op mode. In fact, it is in Co-op mode where most of your options and secrets for the Arena are unlocked. There are only a few "classic" Bond bad-guys to unlock for the arena, including Baron Samedi and OddJob. But who else do you really want?EoN is a game for people who like a lot of variety in their gameplay and enjoy the Splinter Cell or Mission: Impossible kind of games, mixing stealth with action. The single player story mode seems fuller than previous Bond entries, and in my opinion, the reply value is higher than any other, maybe with the exception of Goldeneye. This game just gives you more of everything: more gadgets, more women, more vehicles, more options, more everything that makes you want to play a Bond game. In short, if you're a fan of Bond, James Bond, I think you will love this game.

Although I am not a big rap or wrestling fan, I love fighting games. Since I enjoyed Def Jam Vendetta, I figured Def Jam Fight for NY would be worth checking out. It has turned out to be the most entertaining fighting game I have ever played.The game's single-player storyline revolves around a turf conflict between rival gangs, in which the ownership of clubs and other territory is determined by fights. Over the course of the single-player story, you unlock new fighters and venues which can be selected during other game modes, and develop your character.The create-a-fighter feature was brilliantly incorporated into the story, and provides a good deal of control over the look of your character. You choose the body type, height, weight, skin tone, head shape, eye shape and color, hair style and color, facial hair style and color, even eyebrow shape and color, and select from one of five fighting styles to start out (kick boxing, street fighting, wrestling, martial arts, submissions).As you progress through the game, you earn points which can be used to improve your fighter's abilities and learn new moves and up to two additional fighting styles. You also earn money, which can be used to purchase clothing, jewelry, tattoes, and hair styles. The number of choices, which is huge to begin with, increases as you get further through the game. The better dressed you are, the more the crowd favors you, which helps during fights by increasing your "momentum" meter. When this meter is full, you are able to go into "blazin" mode, where you can perform special moves.Due to the variety of fighting styles and fight modes available, I think this game will appeal to anyone who enjoys fighting games regardless of their style preference. If you prefer martial arts you can create a fighter that uses kick boxing or martial arts (looks like kung fu in the game), if you prefer wrestling you can create a fighter that uses wrestling and submissions. If you just want smack the hell out of people and aren't concerned with style, you can create a fighter that uses street fighting.Even my fiancee, who doesn't care much for video games, has found it entertaining. She watches the fights, then when it comes time for me to buy new clothing or jewelry for my fighter or choose a new hair style, she helps me choose (I know a bit about fighting, but nothing about hip hop fashion).Pros:Intuitive controlsGreat create-a-fighter featureImpressive graphisLots of variety (fighters, venues, styles, clothing, fight types, etc.)Cons:I figured I should include a pro and cons section so that this review would be balanced, but I've been sitting here for a few minutes and still can't think of anything about the game that I don't like.

Well first off, let me just state that I hope that noone was expecting this port to be graphically superior to it's pc counterpart.  The graphics which the pc version harness could pass for next gen.  Besides, just how many console ports nowadays are graphically superior to their pc cousins in general (games of which were originally developed on the pc)?With that said, the Xbox version of HL2 is phenomenal.  Of course the game's not going to look as graphically on par with it's pc counterpart (what games do, with some notable exceptions with titles such as FC:I & D3?) but you must remember that Valve build XB HL2 from the ground up with an entirely different graphics engine.  Even so, the game still looks graphically superior to a majority of the games out on the current gen consoles. The physics engine is still intact & looks wonderful along with the character models.The only real gripes here are that there's some slight framerate issues, especially noticeable right after the game boots up when entering a new area or after saving your game (very brief, but noticeable).  There's also the lack of online play or even a multiplayer sequence.  This port isn't exactly like the RE4 transition from GC to ps2, as to where the later port gets a host of special or exclusive features (extra modes, weapons, missions etc.).  Though extra modes, weapons, multiplayer, and missions would have all been nice for the xbox version of HL2, the reality is that HL2's(gameplaywise) an exact replica of it's pc counterpart.HL2 for xbox is a port developed on xbox for xbox owners (not pc), so if you've already experienced the game for pc, you might just want to steer clear & consider investing in HL2 Aftermath (for xbox version of HL2 is the same as the pc) for pc.  However, if you haven't already played HL2 on the pc, you'd definitely want to check it out for the xbox. You simply cannot go wrong with the experience that is of HL2.
There seems to be this undercurrent that "The Orange Box" --- a collection of five exceptional videogames --- could only be played on the PC.  For one reason or another, the X-Box 360 and PlayStation 3 discs haven't been given their fair praise.  The PS3 version, especially, hasn't been given a fair shake."The Orange Box" is as perfect an experience on the PS3 as it was on a PC, if not better.  I don't say that because it's 100% perfect, mind you.  After all, "Portal" is very short, "Half-Life 2" is a bit unevenly paced, the "HL2" Episodes unfortunately don't have a definitive ending, and "Team Fortress 2" was always a strange bird to me.  I am declaring that "The Orange Box" is a superior product over the PC version because, guess what?...It's guaranteed to work 100% of the time.  A personal computer can't guarantee that for you.  If your computer's too old, then some of the more epic sequences might be too choppy, or you'll have to sacrifice high-res graphics for smooth gameplay, or the loading times might be too long because your computer's doing some background operations.  And if your computer's supernew, Valve's Steam support is here for you, but will it last?  Think about that for a moment...will Steam go away some day?  Now ask yourself, will the PlayStation 3 and a carefully used BluRay ever fail you?The PS3 version of "The Orange Box" seems to be picked for inferior graphics and slightly longer loading times.  First off, all 5 of these games look very good and run very well on Sony's system.  Do they look worse than a PC or 360 version?  Perhaps a little, but you're comparing a 9.9 to a 9.6....are you really gonna lose sleep over this?  As for the loading times, naysayers have picked on this way too much.  So I have to wait 10 seconds for a game to reload after I die instead of 4 seconds; Give me a break!Maybe "The Orange Box" was a vastly inferior product on the PS3 before the mandatory one-time software update (now THAT is annoying).  But as I play these 5 games, this BluRay has only frozen on me one time.  And quite frankly, every PC disc and PS3 disc I own has done that to me at one point in my time.Why not focus on the important story here?  "The Orange Box" includes 5 terrific video games!"Half-Life 2" is a true pioneer in the first-person action genre, and its quality hasn't diminshed since 2004.  The two sequel "Episodes" continue that gripping story, with a shocking conclusion that understandably has fans begging for either "Episode Three" or "Half-Life 3".  And as if "HL2" wasn't enough of a first-person, just take a look at "Portal"!  I don't begrudge fans who call it one of the all-time greats, because its brilliant concept doesn't let up for the 4 hours or so that it gives you.  To me, it's a little too short, but it's a true original.  "Team Fortress 2" is one of the more unusual multiplayer experiences I've encountered, with its diverse classes and matches.  But it's very entertaining should you choose to explore its intricacies."The Orange Box" is a steal, even for the full asking price that most Amazon sellers are charging for this hard-to-find PS3 disc.  It's worth the investment if you don't have the confidence that your computer can run the games.  To be fair, my 2007 Dell computer runs "Portal" and "Team Fortress 2" just fine, while the three "HL" games have some framerate and loading hiccups.  The games are playable if you want to go for the less expensive route and risk it.You want my advice?  Play the original "Half-Life" on PC, and get "The Orange Box" on a console.  If the PlayStation 3 is your only option, I'm sorry Amazon sellers are taking advantage of your predicament.  But after forking the cash, the superior product will put your worries at ease.  All will be forgiven.  So take the dive --- "The Orange Box" is a most valued treasure!GAMESHalf-Life 2 (2004) = 9.5 / 10* This is a game that just keeps on delivering, even though it has some pacing issues.  But the genius is that it trusts you, the gamer, to figure out its puzzles and story without spelling it out for you.  It ends on a strange note, but I believe the intrigue will win you over enough, especially now that some follow-up Episodes have been released.Episode One (2006) and Episode Two (2007) = 9.0 / 10* Aside from being shorter and only introducing a few new gameplay concepts, the stories and action set pieces are equally as exhilerating as the epic "Half-Life 2".  These sequels step away cut through the Orwellian backdrop, and finally force the gamer to feel the impact that the interdimensional rift has caused the human race to endure.  Episode One ends with a bang; Episode Two ends with your heart wrenched.Portal (2007) = 8.5 / 10* I wouldn't be surprised if people bought "The Orange Box" just to play this nifty little gem.  While I think that's overkill, "Portal" is one of the true defining steps in videogame history.  Like other Valve titles, it trusts you the gamer to use your first-person intuition to solve the mysteries and puzzles laid before you.  GlaDOS is one of the most quotable, unforgettable characters in games, and the physics & logic create some truly amazing moments.  The game's pretty short, but then again, it always meant to be more of an experimental bonus.Team Fortress 2 (2007) = 8.0 / 10* To be honest, I haven't spent a ton of time with this one, because the only multiplayer shooter I truly enjoy is the more recent "Call of Duty" titles.  But I will credit Valve for not only thinking outside the box when they assembled this game, but for creating a new one.  The strategies you can implement with the different classes and match types really make each match a unique experience beyond the fragfests of shooters today.  I guess I admire "Team Fortress 2" a lot more than I enjoy it.  It simply wasn't a game meant for me, and after spending about 6 hours with it, I don't think that's gonna change.  But honestly, I always loved "The Orange Box" for the other 4 games on the disc, so having a less appealing 5th one is just a bonus.
if ever there was a reason to own an xbox, half-life 2 is that reason. let me begin by throwing you some details-half life 2 is a port of the pc hit of the same name that blew pc gamers and critics away last year. ports of pc games are usually edited in some way to fit on consoles due to memory, framerate, graphics, etc.... half life 2 is ported to xbox in its ENTIRETY! the fact that valve (hl2's creators) were able to do this is reason for applause not only because of making this happen from a tech perspective, but because people without high-end computers can now experience this awesome, immersive and frightening world!half-life 2 takes place some time after the events of the original, throwing main character Gordon Freeman into an almost Orwellian world where human beings are herded from one place to another like cattle to benefit an unknown means. Gordon is instantly recognized by an underground resistance- and hours of interactive story, brilliant graphics, awesome characters, and visceral action unfold.half-life 2 is unbelievably immersive for four very important reasons:#1. Physics. shooting a window, breaks a window. placing a crate on the edge of a table will cause gravity to take over and make the box fall to the floor. shooting a spike through an enemy close enough to a wall will cause him to stick to that wall indefinitely. Valve then goes the extra distance by giving you the GRAVITY GUN! to put into words what this gun can do will never do it justice- suffice it to say, that after using the gravity gun, a can of paint can become a lethal weapon.#2. Real Digital Actors. Valve has done the greatest job of emulating real human emotions, by using real actors. Nothing is forced yet nothing is static. Most games have cut-scenes. Cut-scenes are basically movie snippets that help to tell the story and give meaning to the objectives present in the game. Although graphically appealing, cut-scenes are not in-game, meaning that you have absolutely no interactivity once the cut-scene starts until it ends. half-life 2 has absolutely NO cut-scenes and relies solely on it's digital actors to move the story along.#3. Gordon Freeman Does Not Speak. You, the player, becomes this character. Gordon is entirely a blank slate for you to obsess. Gordon is placed in a situation where he/you must react on instinct to other characters, environments, and situations. Throughout half-life 2 Gordon Freeman will have no crappy one-liners unless you, the player, shouts them out while being immersed in the game.#4. Incredible A.I. there is never a point in half-life 2 where the enemy A.I. (artificial intelligence) just stands in one place waiting for you to shoot it. enemy's dodge, find cover, and even throw grenades at you. the enemy will flank, assess situations, and do whatever it can to take you out.i could go on and on about other aspects of half-life 2 that set it apart from the crop of other shooters out there, but if the aforementioned facts don't sell you, nothing will. Half-Life 2 is a must have title for any hardcore gamers.onto the negatives.no game will ever be perfect, and in my many years of gaming have come to the conclusion that it all comes down to what you will tolerate. as far as i'm concerned, Half-life 2 is as close to perfection as gaming gets, yet here are some flaws that might be of nuisance to "other" gamers:1. slight hiccups in framerate.2. team a.i. towards the later levels tends to get in the way.3. high-end computer owners have absolutely no reason to purchase this game, same goes for xbox live addicts-  there is no added features, no multiplayer, and no xbox live gameplay in half-life 2. plus pc gamers tend to think that playing games with a mouse and keyboard is better than with a controller.4. half-life 2 has constant, yet short, load times throughout the game.5. finally, anyone uptight with violence, mild language, or the first person perspective  (can you believe people like this exist?!?!?!?!) should steer clear.
The Half-Life 2: Episodes are solid expansions of the quality people have come to expect from Valve games. Like the older Half-Life 2, they are well received by critics, well-supported, widely loved, and continue to build on one of the FPS genre's most defining franchises. No video game library is complete without the Half-Life series.Half-Life 2: Episode 2 also contains several fun Steam achievements that will be displayed on your Steam community profile page after you've attained them, distinguishing you from lesser gamers who have not. The HL2: Episodes continue to build on the ground breaking story originally laid out by the older Half-Life games. For those who have not yet played Half-Life 2, I strongly suggest going with The Orange Box, which comes with a couple other quality Valve games which are also worth playing (though not as good as the Half-Life games in my opinion); namely Team Fortress 2 and Portal. The Orange Box is the best deal you'll find in gaming right now, and Amazon has it at a good price, so I highly recommend that if you don't already own most of the games in the Orange Box.Half-Life 2: Deathmatch also provides a multiplayer component to the Half-Life 2 set. While the Half-Life series' multiplayer leaves something to be desired, the single player component of the game is of absolutely unrivaled quality. There is no series I would recommend more highly than the classic Half-Life series, widely regarded as containing some of the best video games of all time (most notably Half-Life 2 and the original Half-Life). 5/5 stars - a must have for any PC gamer!
Before I begin this review, I'd like to say that I haven't played Team Fortress 2 yet.  I will at some point, but at the moment, I'm not much into online gaming.  But as so many people have pointed out, Team Fortress 2 is widely acknowledged as one of the most enjoyable multiplayer online gaming experiences around, so I don't see how its inclusion here could do anything other than make this already-stellar package even more appealing.REVIEW:The Orange Box is a collection of games from Valve, arguably the most admired and beloved video game developer around today.  Given the sheer amount of content given here, The Orange Box offers perhaps the best value purchase on the PS3.  Not only is the content quite voluminous, but it's quality is absolutely stellar.Half Life 2 has become my favorite single-player first person shooter of all time.  Over 10 years ago, back when I was still in college, I remember being absolutely blown away by the revolutionary shooter for the PC known as Half Life.  Stepping back into the Half Life universe after a decade was not only a comforting blast of nostalgia, but a reminder of how the merging of craft and brilliance can take something that was already so innovative and groundbreaking, and make it better in every way.  Half Life 2 is a near perfect game.  Looking back on the games different chapters, it's astounding how diverse and varied the game is.  The game is enhanced by the way it tells its somewhat simple yet intriguing story.  The battles, NPC interactions, and plot storylines all unfold in the environment around you, just like if you were transported into the game.  There are no cutscenes, and your ability to fully interact with your environment during every moment you play the game makes Half Life 2 one of the most immersive video game experiences you can have.  The action is intense and furious, yet requires constant thought.  I quite simply can't find anything bad to say about Half Life 2.  Around every corner, and in every step Gordon takes from being a fugitive on the run to becoming a revolutionary iconoclast, you can see and feel Valve's brilliance and how much of a labor of love this game was.  Games like this are rare, and this is why in 2010, six years after its original release on PC, Half Life 2 still puts all the other single player FPS's out there to shame.Upon finishing Half Life 2, there's no need to get depressed, as also included here are the two expansion packs, known as Half Life 2: Episodes 1 and 2.  Each expansion adds around 6 more hours of gameplay that continues the story immediately after the events that conclude Half Life 2.  Episode 1, while still very enjoyable, doesn't quite reach the heights of the main game, but Episode 2 does.  Episode 2 is absolutely amazing and will leave you clamoring for the moment when Valve inevitably releases Episode 3.And if all this wasn't enough, there's Portal.  Released to much fanfare, Portal is deserving of the hype and praise that has been bestowed upon it.  A spin off of the Half Life universe, Portal is a puzzle game disguised as a first person shooter where you use a portal gun to navigate rooms/levels full of obstacles.  It's an extremely creative brain teaser that is full of surprises.  Not only is it loads of fun, but it has a wildly wicked sense of humor, a few surprisingly emotional moments, and even an air of mystery.  I have never played anything quite like it before.  Despite its somewhat short length, its one of those games you won't soon forget.With all this said, it is somewhat disappointing that there is a downside to all this.  When Valve decided to bring The Orange Box over to the PS3, they gave duty to Electronic Arts to do the PS3 port.  Unfortunately, EA didn't give this package quite the care that they should have, and the end result are some non-game-breaking, yet somewhat annoying, technical glitches that snuck past their quality control.  I experienced probably 10-15 in-game freezes in all my time with the Orange Box (25+ hours on the Half Life games, plus 6 or so more on Portal), most of them occurring during Portal.  Not terribly bad, but still, an annoyance nonetheless.  More annoying is an audio glitch that adds a horrible, static hiss to the in-game audio.  This wasn't a constant problem, but would occur approximately once every hour while playing, and would last anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes.  This is inexcusable on EA's part, and the lack of this bug would have easily warranted a 5 star rating in my review, as the game freezes didn't occur frequently enough to be a major problem.Overall, even though I must deduct a star for the bugs, I still wholeheartedly recommend The Orange Box to anyone with a PS3.  Half Life 2 is one of the epic action games of all time, and Portal is an event that should not be missed.  Together with Team Fortress 2, this package delivers exceptional value and quality gaming of the highest order.
I have to admit, despite not being a fan of the first person genre, I love Doom. There is something about the exploits of a lonely space marine single-handedly taking on the forces of hell that draws me in and refuses to let go. Still, as enjoyable as Doom and Doom II were, these games generally don't deliver on the challenge front for a seasoned player. While some may consider that a drawback, it was a non-existent problem to me since challenge isn't the most important thing I look for in a game. However, for those that do, they can easily up the ante with Final Doom.To some, Final Doom for the PlayStation will never be anything more than a haphazard potluck. This port doesn't contain every level from the two thirty-two level PC campaigns nor does it contain every level from the twenty-one level Master Levels expansion. In other words, out of pool of eighty-five possible levels, only thirty make an appearance here. So how does this affect the experience? The answer depends on which episode one's talking about and which levels made the cut.Things start out with The Master Levels where thirteen of the possible twenty-one levels make up the core of Final Doom. These levels are meant to test one's mettle with relentless enemy attacks and complex level design, something they do quite well. Players will find a level like Vesperas is hard to tackle regardless of what difficulty level their playing on. Still, the real attraction of the master levels beyond the challenge is the fact the player can carry their status and weaponry from level to level. This isn't possible on the PC since the data for each level is its own file, something that was purposely done so each map would be considered its own separate entity by players. Final Doom on the PlayStation proves how unnecessary this was since each level still feels like a separate experience even though they follow one another.Next up is TNT Evilution, the first of the two Doom II follow-ups presented in the PC version of Final Doom. Taken as a whole, TNT Evilution is an excellent and balanced expansion that just can't make its case with the eleven levels presented here. It could have been better with a better selection of levels, but it's just better to buy a copy of the Doom Collector's Edition for the PC and play it in its entirety. Additionally, while I have nothing against the ambient score whipped up for the PlayStation versions of Doom, I just don't have patience towards it when reflecting back on the wonderful midi-based soundtrack Team TNT created for the PC original.Last up is Plutonia with six levels. Cruel as it may sound, I'm absolutely thrilled this episode got the short end of the stick. Take the challenge of the Master Levels, throw in every cheap shot and tactic in the book and you've got Plutonia in a nutshell. Challenge quickly eclipses entertainment when it comes to levels like Congo, Ghost Town and Onslaught. That said, if you're really serious about tackling the hardest levels Doom can throw at you, I'd again suggest going the PC route so you can save your progress at will. Regardless, while the levels are still well designed at this point I have no problem billing Plutonia as Doom's weakest and ugliest link.The shortcomings of its experiences aside, Final Doom is a worthy and refreshingly different follow-up to Doom. At it's simplest level it may be more of the same, but those who immerse themselves in what it has to offer will find it contains a feel all it's own. It's not always fun, and some parts are of more value than others (The Master Levels being the main draw here) but those with a little patience will have little problem in adding this to their collection.

As an owner of the XB1 version, I got a chance to play the X360 version, and it is surprisingly not a whole lot different from the XB1 version.  I mean the resolution and texture detail is noticeably lower on X360, but the XB1 has 6-8x the resources and yet it doesn't look that much better.  It is basically the same game.  Blueprint (the team that ported it to X360) did a very good job.Performance wise, it's even more similar.  If you watch Digital Foundry's performance analysis at eurogamer, the X360 version's framerate is a bit lower overall, but I'd say it's actually more consistent.  XB1 runs at 60fps when nothing is going on, but dips to the 40s and sometimes the 30s when titans are on screen.  The X360 version runs 40-50fps for the most part, always staying above 30fps.  And for those who prefer a more consistent framerate, there's an option to lock it to 30fps, which also pretty much eliminates the screen tearing.  This option is not available on XB1.Anyone looking to buy Titanfall probably already know what it's about, so I won't talk about the game itself.  I'll just say that it's a fun game.  Revolutionary?  Not in my opinion, but it's definitely good.While Titanfall looks noticeably better on XB1, it is not a looker on any platform, and it is basically the same game.  So if you already own an X360 and are still considering buying an XB1 for Titanfall, I would take a good look at both versions before you decide.  You could possibly save $450-$500.
WHOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!! That was the fist word out of my mouth when I entered the train station for Half-Life 2 on the Xbox. While the graphics weren't suberb and even though I had seen the same video over and over on my computer screen at ign, I was still blown away by it. Half-Life 2 on the Xbox was just an incredible game, and it was kindof sad for me to find out that I could run the game on P.C. even better I didn't want to go out and by another game that was exatly the same except for the two facts that graphics were better on P.C. and that you could also download a multiplayer componant for the P.C. version.Anyways, like most people I was confused to an amount at the end of Half-Life 2. I wasn't mad though, because you know what Valve is pulling off when they leave you hanging on a cliff. They are making you thrive as much as you can to buy the next game that comes out so you can see what happenes. They also pull off this stunt of making you want the next game even more by giving out little to no information about the next game. When e3 2006 pulled around Valve said they would not be showing up, probably because the game was a month away from release anyways.Okay, the past two paragraphs might have possilby seemed pointless but I kind of wanted to give you a backround of things going through my head. I am here to give you my thoughts and review of one of the most amazing games I have ever played in my life: Half-Life 2 Episode One. For any of you who are wondering this phrase, "Why not aftermath, the box above says aftermath on it," I will give you the answer, so the next paragraph might take a little bit so if you know the answer to that question skip the next paragraph.It seems that Valve decided NOT to make an expansion pack called "Aftermath." This time they have decided to give us an episode. No, don't worry, they are not giving us seizures, (though in a game like this you might expieriance one). When I say "episode" I mean something like several parts to a game. Or in simple terms, while Valve takes the next few years or so to create a third game (if they do) they give a nice candy bar which takes around a year to create. This candy bar, if nibbled wisely, will last you till you get your second candy bar, which should be at the end of the year. The idea of episodic games is quite smart and for this game, Valve makes it seem quite sucessful. And the storyline seems made for episodic content.Okay, now that you know the purpose of episodic games and what they are, let us continue into the next pahse: the review itself.Storyline- Last time, I didn't give much of a good revealing to what happened in the storyline, at the ending or the begining. I won't reveal much this time either but for those of you have not played any of Half-life 2 (Half-Life 2 is not required on your computer to run this game) you can eiter listen to this and learn the little information that I will give you OR ignore the following sentances until you reach a long line, just scroll down you'll find it. In Half-Life 2 you are sent by the G-Man, who is your puppeteer in a way, to City 17, one of the few remaining earth cities. Earth has been taken over by a ruthless group of creatures known as the Combine. You fight with your allies, Alyx Vance, Dog, Dr. Kliner, Eli Vance, and a cool soldier named Barney (NOT THE DINOSAUER). You soon enough get to the Citedel which is where all the creatures and soldiers (Combine soldiers) and ships, are coming from. It is the main base of operations for the Combine. Confront the person who said that Earth surrenders to the Combine (Dr. Wallace Breen) and defeate him by destroying the Combine's portal reactor. Which results in a giant explsosion, then the G-Man reapears to take you away.----------------------------------------------------------------System Requirements- Half-Life 2 for the P.C. had one of the largest ranges for system requirements at the time for it's release. It could run on a extremely high system but the minimal requirements were extremely low so any computer that used it could probably run it well. Valve continues to follow doing this, requirements are exactly the same as Half-Life 2 for the P.C. Here's a list:Minimal Requirements1.2 GHz Processor Speed, 256MB RAM, DirectX 7 Level graphics card, Windows 2000/XP/ME/98, Mouse, Keyboard, Internet ConnectionRecommended Requirements2.4 GHz Processor Speed, 512MB RAM, DirectX 9 Level graphics card, Windows 2000/XP, Mouse, Keyboard, Internet ConnectionMy computer easily reaches near the recommended zone, I only have a 2.0 processor. So you probably shouldn't have to worry about this area too much.You will also need a DVD drive for this game if you buy it in stores instead of downloading it from Steam.Graphics- Half-Life 2 on the P.C. stunned the world with graphics, and Valve did it again with a really spiffy update to some of their graphics while maintaining the same requirements as before, like I said. They are really incredible graphics, with amazing facial expressions. You should really try to put the character textures at high in the settings for this game. At least the first chapter because it's amazing to see how Alyx's face can show her signs of being fatigued, sad, worried, happy, amazed and so much more. General textures are amazing at high, but take large chunks out of that framerate of yours if it is at high. Sadly, I had to put it at medium, which looks like the Xbox graphics: not too appealing. HDR, stands for High Dynamic Range, which is hard to explain but I will try to tell you how greatly it works in this game. Take a sunny day at home and have a window shade covering half your window, avoid letting any other lights in the room so it is quite dark compared to the rest of your home. Now, stare at an area in the room that barely has any light on it, also make sure no light from the window is touching this surface. Continue to stare at it for about 10 seconds. When you are done, look at surface near the window that has the light from the window shining on it. The area should look enlightened to a large extent, to the point where you can only see pure light, you can't even see details on the surface clearly. In due time, it will not seem to bright anymore, and you will see details on that surface again. This is one of the features you will expieriance with HDR fully enabled in the game. Not every level includes HDR just to know. I was very happy to know that my computer ran this game with full HDR without large portions of framerate drop. Whenever there is a game that has HDR, it normally does not run that well at all. The Rainbow Six Lockdown P.C. demo ran terribly with HDR, and Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter does not even run on my computer, I attempted to install the demo. In the advanced graphic settings area in the menu, there is stars next to the settings that Valve recommends you use in the game. These settings, from what I know, are all different for each and every computer, and they are quite trust worthy. I get a very good balance of graphics and framerate with these settings, the only dissapointment for me in these recomendations is that they say I should completely turn off Anti-Aliasing. There is a large amount more on the graphics to this game, but I feel I should press on.Gameplay- An area large amounts of people look at. Really the gameplay is very identical to the gameplay in Half-Life 2, intense. But with Alyx fighting at your side throughout almost the entire game, you get a different feeling. There is a good variety of fun moments where Alyx will do something scripted, like get into a sniper position and cover you as you advance into the next area, pop the heads off of Zombines (more about them later) and more. The gun training feeling that I mentioned in the Half-Life 2 review on Xbox is not integrated into the game as well this time. But you don't really need it to be. Also the locations you fight in have good variety this time, like a dark, scary, low ammo, power downed, undergound, highway. Full of Zombines and Zombies. Zombines are the names that Alyx gave to Combine soldiers that have been taken over by headcrabs. They are quite tough creatures, and take more than one shotgun blast to kill, unlike normal zombies. You'll also be fighting creatures more often this time, considering the fact that the Combine defense if failing, so there are more antlions and alike creatures making their way into City 17. Another place you fight in is obviously City 17. The Gravity gun is still there, and you get another fun time to have it supercharged but it will die off in time. Really, this game won't last you long. Five chapters long, and something around 4-6 hours. BUT, Valve gives you a director's commentary included, you don't need to go out and buy a limited edition or anything, you already have a commentary which is really fun and nice. You'll learn quite a bit about the clever minds of Valve and it's amazing how they create simple things that you don't notice to give you such a great game. So the replayabillity is still in the medium level, enough to last me till Episode Two at the end of the year. Also, after you beat the game there is a sneak peak trailer for the next episode which I will not say anything about, not even my opinion on it. So you get quite a bit with twenty dollars.  Also, loading times, which came often on the Xbox version but went by quickly are still here in Half-Life 2 Episode One. This time, the loading times happen less often, but they last longer, like a bathroom break longer.Okay, moving on again because I was running out of things to write about the gameplay.Sound- As good as Half-Life 2 for P.C. Half-Life 2 on the Xbox had some strange differances with the sound than the P.C. version but it was good. Also, in this game, if you set the video settings too high it is possilbe you might run into sound problems in the opening video but shouldn't happen. Also the stuttering problems in sound compared to what I've heard about the P.C. version of Half-Life 2 seem to be fixed.Music- I've said it before that I'm not much a person who WRITES about music. Half-Life 2 Episode One still has music that is strange, but it still matches the game enjoyably.A.I.- With Half-Life 2 Episode One, the A.I., that was used incredibly with Half-Life 2, has been enhanced to even smarter levels than before. They'll still pull off smart flankings. Zombines will charge you after you shoot them for the fist time, they also at certain times pull out grenades and walk towards you while they hold it. Which is funny watch when you have a whole group of Zombies around him. Friendly character A.I. is mostly noticed with Alyx as she does a few cool instant kill moves. Along with smart pistol shooting. Really, Valve said that they did not give Alyx too many good fighting attacks when shooting. But what can be really cool is when you use your flashlight in the dark to let her see the enemies and she takes out the bad guys.The game is Half-Life 2 Episode One, the developer is Valve. This is the review, and I'm summing up what I've typed for an hour and a half. Hope you enjoy this game and be amazed that much.
Valve has made itself distinct in the PC world of gaming. We've all played through at least one session of Gordon Freeman clobbering some headcrab, have fond memoriories of a killer game of Team Fortress, and each time we see the fat man with the knob on his dome, we recognize how much skill Valve has. But Valve take the easy way out, by making the Orange Box a smourgasboard of games, but small ones.The Orange Box is a great game deal, there's no denying that; the entire Half Life 2 collection with the 2nd sequal, the much innovative, mind-blowing Portal, and one of the origonal class-based multiplayers, Team Fortress 2. While there is 5 games total, the only true full game is the origonal Half Life 2. Both sequals are just episodes(half a game), not a full fledged 20+hr game, which goes the same for Portal, Valve's interpetation of a test lab rat. Among all the gold(or orange) in the Box, Portal truly is a diamond, by circling around a wormhole-generator gun as the main gameplay mechanic, using it to solve puzzles for a appliance company. Seems simple enough, but innovation is just breaking into games now(outside Nintendo). Portal is enjoyable enough, fun enough, and brillant enough to stand on it's own two feet, but Valve gives it 4 support beams to fall back on, channling the Box as a pilot game to lauch a hopefull franchise.After hitting the snooze button for 10 years, Valve woke up to the fans call of a 2nd edition of Team Fortress. Instead of following the sequal norm of an upgraded graphic engine, Valve rehauls the whole look, flip-flopping over to a Pixar-type look, Incredibles, if I had to call one out, but ramped up violence/blood is what slappes the M on the box more than anything. Valve keeps one eye on TF2 online, now giving patches and updates for the unpopular clases, which keeps gameplay fresh and stops Valve from pumping out another full fledged game. Team Fortress has a great online community, but thats just it. It's ALL online, nothing else. No offline services, which isen't to bad, but when fans get love affairs for certain maps, the play-feild gets real stale.Even though Valve gave us 5 games(4shorties) it's has all the makings for the perfect game sequal: a strong foundation to build off of(Half-Life 2), fresh new ideas, while still keeping to it's roots(Episodes 1 and 2, Portal), plus, a killer multiplayer function(Team Fortress 2). Valve put all of the ideas in the same box, but just put barriars between them.

The Ratchet & Clank Series has come a long way over the years, but this is the game that started it all.  If you're new to Ratchet & Clank, the concept is a simple one:  Ratchet is (he thinks!) the last of his kind.  He is a whiz with gadgets and mechanics, and as we kick off the series he quickly falls into the role of 'Hero', taking on one small quest after another, building to the biggest, which is to save the galaxy from an opportunistic alien bent on conquering everybody.  Ratchet's sidekick is a clever little robot named Clank.  Clank not only helps him figure things out, he serves as some of Ratchet's gadgets, transforming into gadgets like a helicopter backpack, and more.  Clank also gets some play-time of his own, too:  there are times when you get to navigate him around a smaller-scale world, often enlisting the help of his fellow robots.  The world of Ratchet & Clank is a sci-fi world where there are plenty of planets to explore and all kinds of interesting life forms, most of whom want to kill you (but a few would settle for a good 3-lap race or two).  Dialogue varies from funny to downright hilarious, and there is enough variety in your objectives to keep things from getting boring.The beauty of the Ratchet & Clank series is that it marries both sides of platform heaven:  Ratchet gives you the jumping-action-shooting, while Clank lets you play strategy-maze-puzzle styled areas.  As a whole the series is quite fun, and each installment seems to come up with more gadgets and fun things to do than the entire run of Warner Brothers' Roadrunner/Coyote cartoons.  As you go from place to place, the bolts you collect can be used to buy new weapons and ammo, as well as creative little gadgets:  for example, one device is a suction gun designed to drain water from various levels...but can also be used to vacuum up smaller enemies and then toss them at larger ones!If you're a fan of Ratchet and Clank and you know your way around, you'll have to be a little forgiving of this title:  it's not as polished as the later entries.  You won't have as many gadgets, and you will have enough minor button or camera problems to remind you that the early days of platforming were not a perfect science.  If you're completely new to the series, this is still a good place to start.  It's fun, it's got entertaining characters and dialogue, and bouncy, cheery music that makes this very first Ratchet & Clank tons of fun.  I'd love to see them remake a "Ratchet Trilogy" with this title, as has been done for Sly Cooper.
The Ratchet & Clank Series has come a long way over the years, but this is the game that started it all.  If you're new to Ratchet & Clank, the concept is a simple one:  Ratchet is (he thinks!) the last of his kind.

The Ratchet & Clank Series has come a long way over the years, and Going Commando was a good sequel to guarantee the series would stick.  If you're new to Ratchet & Clank, the concept is a simple one:  Ratchet is (he thinks!) the last of his kind.  He is a whiz with gadgets and mechanics, and as we start Going Commando, both have he and Clank have fallen into the role of 'Hero', having gained a bit of celebrity from their previous adventures.  Ratchet's sidekick is a clever little robot named Clank.  Clank not only helps him figure things out, he serves as some of Ratchet's gadgets, transforming into gadgets like a helicopter backpack, and more.

While the same concept of collecting bolts to pay for ammo and new weapons is still here, Going Commando also adds a bit of an RPG element:  your guns and gadgets can 'level up':  the more you use them, the better they get.  You also have some smarter tools at your disposal, such as a kind of whirling boomerang that's really good at homing in on multiple bad guys and hitting them once or twice.That said, if you're a fan of Ratchet and Clank and you know your way around, you'll have to be a little forgiving of this title:  it's not as polished as the later entries and it still suffers from some of the basic camera problems that can make a 3D platformer frustrating.

Back in 2003, Insomniac didn't seem to be capable of making bad games, or even so-so games. All three games in their Spyro the Dragon trilogy on the PlayStation were great, and their PS2 debut title Ratchet & Clank was perhaps even better than the best Spyro ever had to offer. Expectations should be high for the next adventure of the lombax and his robotic counterpart as a result, so it's certainly a good thing that Going Commando delivers plenty of improvements and another fresh and fun adventure.Going Commando's story is surprisingly entertaining. Ratchet and Clank are first called upon to help a giant corporation called Megacorp stop a thief who stole a dangerous project-gone-wrong called the Protopet, but the tale eventually involves some plot twists that are funny and unexpected as can be. Add the entertaining plot to the plentiful light humor and well-voiced characters, and the result is a surprisingly worthwhile story.As a sequel, Going Commando proves that Insomniac is all about small improvements that together greatly improve the game at the very core. The original Ratchet & Clank title was especially unique for its deft blend of action and platforming; Going Commando manages to improve both, though the emphasis has definitely shifted a bit in favor of the action. The game's weapons are far stronger and more useful than those from the original, and they can also be upgraded by extensive use (perhaps the game's greatest core improvement). The weapon Quick Select feature also pauses the game, unlike in the original, getting rid of all the annoyances that came from equipping a weapon while enemies could still fire away at you. Throw more plentiful and powerful enemies into the equation and Going Commando ups the ante in action for an overall more entertaining experience.Improvements have also been made in the game's special levels. Clank sections now have a larger variety of robots, hoverbike races are improved with tighter controls, and giant Clank battles are also great destructive fun. Space battles are added with much success, with solid controls and simple but varied objectives. There are also new, quicker ways to earn bolts battling hordes or enemies in arenas and searching for crystals in vast, perilous fields. These are all good fun and nicely change up the game's pace.Going Commando's greatest strength is easily in its replay value. After beating the game's final boss, you are given the option to warp back to before you beat the game or start over on hard mode. Hard mode makes enemies tougher, but Ratchet isn't left without an advantage: better versions of each of his weapons can be purchased and upgraded again, and a bolt multiplier is also added to help players gather the bolts required to purchase this powerhouse weaponry. Playing with these unique and powerful weapons is a blast, and makes Going Commando even more fun to play the second time than the first.Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando is a prime example of how to make a great sequel. The plot is funnier, the action bigger, and the replay value, well, more valuable. It's well worth buying for anyone who wants a simple, entertaining, and high quality action game, whether you've played the first game or not. Going Commando is an all-around better game than its predecessor, and that's exactly what a sequel is supposed to be.9.5/10

Insomniac games is mostly known for creating Spyro the Dragon back on the original Playstation.  And when the PS2 came out, there were probably millions of fans waiting for a follow up to that series on the PS2.  Instead Insomniac Games developed a different kind of tale.  One that would serve as a nice little compliment to Naughty Dog's Jak and Daxter (similar to how Spyro served as a nice compliment to Crash Bandicoot).  It was a game all about weapons, explosions and destruction.  The game was Ratchet and Clank.  It came out in 2002, sold millions of copies and went on to start one of the core franchises on the PS2.  Ratchet and Clank was, and still is, a triumph.Ratchet and Clank begins on Planet Veldin.  Ratchet belongs to a race known as the Lombax.  As he's fixing a ship to one day get off the planet, another ship crashes down.  Checking it out, Ratchet finds nothing more than a small robot.  This is Clank and as it turns out he's carrying an urgent message.  A man by the name of Drek is taking pieces of land from other worlds to rebuild his own.  Leaving the planets he takes from in shambles with no other alternative than to be destroyed or abandoned.  Clank wants to go find the legendary hero Qwark, and fixes the ship Ratchet in exchange for help to find him.  Ratchet, however, doesn't seem to care too much about Drek at the start, but slowly gets involved in the quest anyway.There isn't exactly much story to Ratchet and Clank.  It's not weak storytelling by any means, but the games to follow would do a lot of things so much better.  All the plot twists are pretty obvious twists, for instance.  At the very least the voice acting is great in most areas and there's a good sense of humor about things.  That's not to say there are no hiccups with the storytelling.  The villain is no where near as fun as what the game would produce later on in the series.  Likewise, the story doesn't draw you in nearly as much.  For the Playstation 2, however, it's certainly an achievement with all the right bits falling into place.  For a game made in 2002 there are a lot of beautifully crafted cutscenes that still hold up well, even to this day.  It's like watching a Saturday morning cartoon at times.Ratchet and Clank is well aware that it's greatest strength is not in the storytelling.  It's not Ratchet and Clank's weakness either, but it is to say that Insomniac Games knows that the strength is in the gameplay because it's nearly flawless.  Throughout much of the game you will play as Ratchet.  Though Clank gets small segments.  Ratchet primarily roams with Clank on his back.  You have a nice arsenal of weapons at your disposal.  You'll start off with pretty basic weapons such as the Bomb Glove and Blaster but you'll soon be firing off missiles and planting decoys and using flamethrowers.  The weapons are usually well balanced, enough that none of them will ever become useless as the game goes on, but there is definitely a "best" weapon for many situations.  It's interesting to see what all of them do, but you'll no doubt find yourself with a favorite at some point.The game has a pretty simplistic flow to it as well.  You'll often go to various planets and complete specific missions by taking one path or another that leads to the completion of different objectives.  Not EVERY objective must be completed on a planet.  The main goal is usually to find the infobot or use various items to learn the coordinates to another planet where you can continue the journey.  For the most part Ratchet and Clank is quite a linear game as you can never really get too far ahead of yourself.  And as you explore each planet there are plenty of shortcuts that will take you right back to the very beginning where you can get back in your ship and fly to another planet.Ratchet and Clank is not an easy game but it's not too taxing either.  Even if you fail a couple of times you'll start to learn the ins and outs of whereever it is you're not doing so well.  The game is easy to learn but difficult to master.  That being said, you'll rarely feel as though the game is being unfair.  Most danger presents itself early enough that there's no trial and error about it.  There will be some moments that will likely give you trouble but nothing that will keep you down so long you'll quit in frustration.There are small moments where you'll play as Clank and he controls quite differently.  While you'll still be running and jumping, Clank doesn't have weapons.  Rather he controls several tiny bots that can be ordered to attack, wait, follow you or enter into various stations that require it.  It adds a slight puzzle element to the game, but Clank's moments aren't quite as action packed.Ratchet and Clank has a lot to keep you going and it's a well structured game.  The story isn't much, but it's rather enjoyable just the same.  The story isn't really the focus here, the gameplay is.  That's not to say that production values of Ratchet and Clank are bad, though.  By far, Ratchet and Clank is one of the best looking games on the PS2.  And because of its colorful aesthetics still looks good even to this day.  This includes in HD.  There's a lot of life in the universe of Ratchet and Clank.  It's all around easy on the eyes.  The music, however, may be the best part.  There was no slumping on this.  Each planet sounds strangely in tune with the action.  All the moments are lovely and playful when they need to be and a bit darker and more perilous when they need to be as well.  If there's one thing Insomniac games really knows how to do: It's make a good sounding and looking game.For those that love adventure, Ratchet and Clank is nearly a perfect package.  It offers just about everything you want from a solid platformer.  If you enjoy platformers, it's not to be missed.  And it just so happens the HD collection is out there if you happen to have a PS3 and don't want to dust off your PS2.

It is practically common knowledge in the video game community that Spyro the Dragon, a beloved character from the PlayStation days, is pretty much history. Once the PS2/GC/Xbox era arrived, Spyro games suddenly became terrible; the reason for this madness is that Insomniac, Spyro's creators, abandoned the purple dragon in favor of a character named Ratchet and his robot buddy Clank. Much like the Spyro games before it, Ratchet & Clank is a skillfully made game that innovates the 3-D platformer while maintaining simplicity and pure fun, only this time around a new theme has given Insomniac even more liberty to create bizarre yet likeable worlds, characters, and weapons for a game that's every bit as good as their previous efforts.While Ratchet is making some final touches on his ship one day, a small robot, whom he names Clank, falls from the sky after being shot down by enemies and helps Ratchet start his ship. This sends the pair on an adventure that eventually involves deception, vengeance, and an evil chairman bent on destroying the galaxy to rake in the cash (that makes a little more sense in context of the full story). The tale is far better than it needs to be to carry a game like Ratchet & Clank, with a plot that's more than the typical save the princess or kill the villain fantasy. The game also adds an interesting character development as Clank continually tries to make Ratchet see what their mission's priority needs to be while Ratchet struggles with a blinding vengeful attitude. The dialogue also keeps the story interesting with its continual light humor.The story creates the backbone of Ratchet & Clank, but the gameplay makes up pretty much everything else. The game is a unique blend of 3-D platforming and third person action that focuses on developing both elements to greatness. Bringing the elements together is the collection of bizarre and fun tools and weaponry the pair acquires throughout their intergalactic adventure. There are basic weapons such as the Blaster and Pyrocitor (flamethrower), but there is also a Morph Gun, which turns enemies into chickens, Tesla Claw, which shoots thunderbolts, and many more. Tools that aid the platforming area include the Hydrodisplacer, which relocates small bodies of water, and the Swingshot, which helps Ratchet cross gaps. The weapons are fun and effective to use, but switching weapons is sometimes a hazard as the game doesn't pause while players use the Quick Select feature to equip another weapon or tool.Weapons and tools in hand, the dynamic duo must travel the galaxy and visit many diverse planets in their quest to stop Chairman Drekk. Each planet is well designed as a standalone level, but what makes the level design work so well is the way it draws the player back to previously visited planets with a minimal amount of backtracking. Getting from planet to planet is as simple as hopping in the Ratchet's ship and choosing a destination, and after a particular objective is cleared on a planet there is an option to warp to that point in the level. Other missions also use parts of the levels that are unreachable on the first visit due to lack of equipment, but the game never forces the player to spend even 5 minutes getting back to where they were on the level. To top it all off, the various tools in the game call for many creative puzzles, such as the previously mentioned Hydrodisplacer that can be used to reach higher areas by moving bodies of water. For those reasons, Ratchet & Clank is a very well designed game, and the enjoyment factor benefits from that element greatly.The entire adventure can take roughly 15 hours to clear, which is a solid length for this type of game. After the final boss is defeated there are also many incentives to play back through the game with plenty of unlockable goodies, and Ratchet keeps all the weapons acquired in the previous playthrough. There are also gold versions of each weapon, which require the collection of gold bolts (which are very hard to find) and payment of thousands of regular bolts (the game's currency). So in the end Ratchet & Clank has a solid adventure that still has plenty to offer after it has been cleared.Visually speaking, Ratchet & Clank is a huge step up for Insomniac. Of course, the PS2 has a lot more power than its predecessor, so naturally the quality received a huge boost, but the game's visual style looks so much sharper than in the Spyro games. The main reason this is significant is that there was no difference between the graphics in the second and third Spyro games, and suddenly the style and quality improved greatly in the company's next game. Considering it was an early PS2 game it also looks great with nice textures and colors, lively animations, and character models that successfully convey individuality in each character.Ratchet & Clank is, despite being set in a totally different world, still somewhat reminiscent of the Spyro games. It is clear that Insomniac didn't do away with everything that made Spyro great and start over: they even recycled several favorite sound effects from the series. The rest of the game's sound adds nicely to the effects of shooting a gun or using a unique tool. The game's music is good as well in that it successfully conveys each planet's theme, and yet the soundtrack is also similar to Spyro's. Ratchet & Clank's sound makes it clear that Insomniac didn't want to do away with everything they had done well with before, and the result is a sound package that fits the game perfectly while still reminding players of the entirely different world of Spyro.It might seem that I have spoken about Spyro a little too much in a review about Ratchet & Clank, but I think it's important to note that, being its successor in a sense, the game improves upon Insomniac's already proven formula and adds a fresh twist to it, throwing it in a new world on the intergalactic scale. Ratchet & Clank is great fun because it doesn't try to be flashy or revolutionary, yet it innovates the platformer in some unique and exciting ways. PS2 owners should definitely pick up a copy of Ratchet & Clank, because it's a great game that is also sold for a bargain price nowadays.Positive:+ Solid story and character development with humorous dialogue+ Perfect blend of action and platforming+ Plenty of fun and bizarre weapons+ Level design conveniently links all the worlds together+ High replay value+ Graphics are greatly enhanced from Insomniac's previous gamesNegative:- Quick selecting a weapon doesn't pause the game9.0/10
It is practically common knowledge in the video game community that Spyro the Dragon, a beloved character from the PlayStation days, is pretty much history. Once the PS2/GC/Xbox era arrived, Spyro games suddenly became terrible; the reason for this madness is that Insomniac, Spyro's creators, abandoned the purple dragon in favor of a character named Ratchet and his robot buddy Clank. Much like the Spyro games before it, Ratchet & Clank is a skillfully made game that innovates the 3-D platformer while maintaining simplicity and pure fun, only this time around a new theme has given Insomniac even more liberty to create bizarre yet likeable worlds, characters, and weapons for a game that's every bit as good as their previous efforts.While Ratchet is making some final touches on his ship one day, a small robot, whom he names Clank, falls from the sky after being shot down by enemies and helps Ratchet start his ship. This sends the pair on an adventure that eventually involves deception, vengeance, and an evil chairman bent on destroying the galaxy to rake in the cash (that makes a little more sense in context of the full story). The tale is far better than it needs to be to carry a game like Ratchet & Clank, with a plot that's more than the typical save the princess or kill the villain fantasy. The game also adds an interesting character development as Clank continually tries to make Ratchet see what their mission's priority needs to be while Ratchet struggles with a blinding vengeful attitude. The dialogue also keeps the story interesting with its continual light humor.The story creates the backbone of Ratchet & Clank, but the gameplay makes up pretty much everything else. The game is a unique blend of 3-D platforming and third person action that focuses on developing both elements to greatness. Bringing the elements together is the collection of bizarre and fun tools and weaponry the pair acquires throughout their intergalactic adventure. There are basic weapons such as the Blaster and Pyrocitor (flamethrower), but there is also a Morph Gun, which turns enemies into chickens, Tesla Claw, which shoots thunderbolts, and many more. Tools that aid the platforming area include the Hydrodisplacer, which relocates small bodies of water, and the Swingshot, which helps Ratchet cross gaps. The weapons are fun and effective to use, but switching weapons is sometimes a hazard as the game doesn't pause while players use the Quick Select feature to equip another weapon or tool.Weapons and tools in hand, the dynamic duo must travel the galaxy and visit many diverse planets in their quest to stop Chairman Drekk. Each planet is well designed as a standalone level, but what makes the level design work so well is the way it draws the player back to previously visited planets with a minimal amount of backtracking. Getting from planet to planet is as simple as hopping in the Ratchet's ship and choosing a destination, and after a particular objective is cleared on a planet there is an option to warp to that point in the level. Other missions also use parts of the levels that are unreachable on the first visit due to lack of equipment, but the game never forces the player to spend even 5 minutes getting back to where they were on the level. To top it all off, the various tools in the game call for many creative puzzles, such as the previously mentioned Hydrodisplacer that can be used to reach higher areas by moving bodies of water. For those reasons, Ratchet & Clank is a very well designed game, and the enjoyment factor benefits from that element greatly.The entire adventure can take roughly 15 hours to clear, which is a solid length for this type of game. After the final boss is defeated there are also many incentives to play back through the game with plenty of unlockable goodies, and Ratchet keeps all the weapons acquired in the previous playthrough. There are also gold versions of each weapon, which require the collection of gold bolts (which are very hard to find) and payment of thousands of regular bolts (the game's currency). So in the end Ratchet & Clank has a solid adventure that still has plenty to offer after it has been cleared.Visually speaking, Ratchet & Clank is a huge step up for Insomniac. Of course, the PS2 has a lot more power than its predecessor, so naturally the quality received a huge boost, but the game's visual style looks so much sharper than in the Spyro games. The main reason this is significant is that there was no difference between the graphics in the second and third Spyro games, and suddenly the style and quality improved greatly in the company's next game. Considering it was an early PS2 game it also looks great with nice textures and colors, lively animations, and character models that successfully convey individuality in each character.Ratchet & Clank is, despite being set in a totally different world, still somewhat reminiscent of the Spyro games. It is clear that Insomniac didn't do away with everything that made Spyro great and start over: they even recycled several favorite sound effects from the series. The rest of the game's sound adds nicely to the effects of shooting a gun or using a unique tool. The game's music is good as well in that it successfully conveys each planet's theme, and yet the soundtrack is also similar to Spyro's.

Red alert is a great game and certainly worth buying but you can pick it up in a variety of packages and prices here on amazon and this one is NOT the most economical. I'll explain later.Now to the game. Yes red alert is now an old game by PC standards. The graphics are still ok but not obviously up to snuff compared to tiberian sun or it's sequal red alert 2. Never the less red alert is a blast and might still be the most enjoyable, playable game in the whole command and conquer seris including those newer games. Anybody familiar with any one CnC game basically knows how to play them all because the concept is the same. You need two resources to function. The most important resource is had by making refineries and sending out harvesters to gather it. In this game it is called ore, in tiberian sun it is called tiberian but it all doesn't matter because the entire game is focused on getting as many harvesters at work as possible and protecting them so you have the credits neccesary to build your military. From an offensive perspective of course you want to try and cut off your opponents harvesters and that's at least half the game. The other resource is power which is easily had by building power plants from time to time.The game features two very evenly matched sides in a mostly conventional military battle. The russians and the ukrainians on one side and the allies on the other with germany, france and england. The russians and the ukrainians have the bigger more powerful tanks, a heavy tank and the mammoth. The allies have tanks that are smaller quicker and cheaper. The russians can make deadly telsa coils for defense which electrocute the enemy while the ally countries can make cheaper better armoured conventional turrets and pill boxes. The russians can make a substantial air attack with fast flying mig bombers and yaks. The allies are limited to helecopters but can make a real navy with destroyers and crusiers while the other side can only make defensive submarines. The sides are balanced and which country you choose to play with will be determined by the map. If the map has lot's of water on it you may prefer to be one of the ally countries so you can build a navy.Overall the action is constant and the battles can be intense. One of the things that sets this game and all the CnC games apart from other rts games is that these games are much more base camp limited. In this game you have a command center and you build around it. You can make a sevice depot and then make an mcv but you still have to place it down some place and build around it. Those who are more used to games like total annililation or age of empires may find this confining. In those games you have mobile units that allow you to build anything anywhere on the map irregardless of how close or far they may be from another structure or unit. Here you have to build within the camp and while you can make mcv's and build other camps they are not easy to protect and mcv's are expensive. Normally in the course of a game you may have your major camp and one smaller additional one whose purpose is to protect you harvesters as they have to go out further and further for ore.Overall red alert is a very fun well balanced game that still has many followers today. Go on mplayer or westwood and you will find dozens even hundreds of players. There are dozens of good downloads available online including mega maps and desktop theme packs. I highly recommend the coop maps which allow you and a bud to ally and take on a super charged AI opponent. With coop you can really play as a single team where each player can control the others units and the maps are great.Finally, don't buy this game package. You can buy just red alert for $ so why pay more for this? Also red alert is now available in a couple of nice game packages. You can buy red alert and gettysburg along with another rts game in one package and another package allows you to buy 10 games including this one.

Total War is a great STRATEGY game. Why? Because you have to make lots of decisions that will affect your clan and decide your fate. A great strategy game challenges you to think and decide on what to do in the present or to think ahead in the future in order to succeed. You'll find yourself asking: 'should i have a huge but weak(lots of cheap ashigaru) army, or a small but high quality army(warrior monks)?', 'do i build up my military and conquer or do i eliminate my enemies with geishas?', 'do i use my koku to upgrade a military unit, or upgrade my lands?', 'should i buy one unit of soldiers to defend my land, or hope my enemy/ally doesn't attack me and build up my lands for the next harvest?'. Just a few things that will rack your brain when playing as great strategy games are capable of doing(on and off the battlefield). The only area that I think the original game lacked was in the diplomacy option. Very little interaction as far as diplomacy is concerned. Buy this game if you don't have it. At this price, it's very affordable and an excellent value for pure strategy gaming fun. For those wondering about the expansion, you already have the original probably so my 'review' will be a very specific comparison(plus some hints to newbies at the end). Here goes...*the expansion makes the game too easy, try it on expert, and you'll still do well. The 'Hojo clan run amok' problem has been rectified. All STW gamers know what I'm talking about:)*new scenarios(certain points in time...one scenario doesn't have the Mori Clan or arquebusiers for instance) and campaigns(just historical battles strung together unfortunately) make things more interesting, plus you get the Mongols vs Hojo clan scenario.*camera system is fixed, you need to use your mouse to 'click' on an angle. this prevents the annoying camera drift when some units are retreating and the camera follows them instead of the ones that are still fighting, but prevents you from really 'dragging' the camera right into the thick of battle to get up close and personal with your troops like in the orig.*4 new Japanese units, 6 new in the Mongol scenario. No real standouts though. only a couple of new techs too, nothing great:(*definite graphical difference(but better or worse depends on your taste), sound is slightly better but voices take a backseat.  gameplay is essentially the same, but you also get to use your emissary to bribe armies to join you for a fixed amount of koku, alliances are slightly stronger, etcnewbie hints....*send out ashigaru to cross bridges first as bait, as enemy approaches have your archers fire. no big loss if you lose ashigaru, send your 'good' troops across the bridge when your archers run out of arrows or you've reduced your opponent to a more reasonable amount. storm their archers first if you can.*give up low income provinces...concentrate on conquering, maintaining, defending, high income/output provinces(especially one with river crossings, like Owari).*build up 2 or 3 provinces and 'max' it out. make one your 'revenue' province(upgrade land, max out its income potential, don't waste $ upgrading provinces that won't give you a high return). make another your 'military' province(max out its military capabilities as to the units and its morale, swordsmanship, armour, etc), and have one be your 'geisha' province(build techs to reach the geishas who can single-handedly wipe-out clans, also, you can order emissaries and shinobi here without having to waste 'ordering' them in your 'military' province).*attack a high-income neighboring province as soon as possible, this gives you the income and reduces your opponents income in the next harvest.*if you attack a province in the summer, maintain it in autumn, you will get revenue in winter(whereas if you attack in autumn, you won't get the 'xtra' income in winter)*if it takes two seasons to order a unit, buy it in the autumn.  therefore, you'll only have to pay the cost amount but you  won't have to pay their expenses in the winter harvest(cause they won't be ready till spring).*newbies, play on easier levels first to avoid frustration and keep an eye out for Hojo(type .matteosartori. for full map view)!  And yes, the rebels are playable, with a code....I'm sure I made some mistakes or forgot something along the way, but this is just a rough overview of a game that I think is a must buy for strategy fans.

Being a politician has never been easier than with SimCity 4, the John F. Kennedy, Jr. of simulations.  This scion of the first and greatest simulation of all time is the latest, and most elegant of all the members of the SimCity dynasty.Blessed with stunningly realistic graphics and a hip nouveau-easy listening (I believe the word is "ambient") soundtrack, this game kicks the wow-factors like David Copperfield in Vegas.  However, the game requires serious performance from your PC, so don't expect it to play in high-detail mode if your computer isn't pretty souped up; even if you do have some newer hardware on your PC and an abundance of memory, your larger cities might slow down significantly or even cause your computer to freeze or crash.Modeled after it predecessors, SC4 works much like its earlier incarnations.  You start as the Mayor of a bare piece of land, add residential, commercial, and industrial zones, establish roads, power and water sources, and those little community necessities such as schools, police and fire stations, waste disposal and parks.  You can't specifically choose what will be developed in each zone, but you can exert influence with your Mayoral choices.  No school around?  Watch the low-income tract houses with dirt patios spring up.  Got a hospital and a library nearby?  Tract houses are torn down as mansions and cottages quickly replace them.  As your city grows, traffic, pollution, fires, and shrinking open space become concerns the Mayor has to address.But what's a game sequel without never-before-seen features?  Before you start your political career, SC4 has an amazing God Mode that allows you to click topography into being and then erode it all away, sweep trees across the land and populate it with wild animals, and unleash disasters onto your unsuspecting landscape.  You can also view your city in the day or night, or allow it to cycle through the entire day.  (This is fun to watch the first few times, but it's hard to manage your city when it gets dark outside).In addition, SC4 gives you a region containing many cities that serve as your saved game slots (much like the neighborhoods in The Sims), and your cities can share resources such as water, railroads, or power.  Be aware that your odd topography will have to be "reconciled" to the edges of neighboring cities in order for the cities to interact.In order to give SC4 crossover appeal with lovers of The Sims, SC4 is equipped with a Sims mode where you can move your favorite sim into a home within your city limits.  (The game provides a docket of prefab sims, but you can also import them from your own Sims or Sims Unleashed games.)  Once moved in, however, your sim interacts with the city without your intervention (unless you decide to strike Deuce Flyer's house with lightning, that is).  The interface is another detail that is more reminiscent of The Sims than of previous SimCity games, and this is definitely a plus, as it is fairly intuitive and makes city management painless.Once you are done terraforming, you're ready to embark on a city-building mission.  You start with $100,000, which is enough to build a fairly impressive city, however, the money quickly runs out if you don't budget well (city management is the name of the game).  The game has city advisors who are each in charge of a particular facet of the city, and who give advice with their own agendas in mind.  The only way to make your city prosper is to figure out the right balance of restraint and commerce.  Even seasoned SimCity freaks will spend hours of game play strategizing before they hit upon the ideal city-building and management process.Once your city starts growing, Mayoral bonuses are unlocked, based on the specific achievements of your city or region; have a lot of agricultural areas, and you might just get that Farmer's Market.  If you get in trouble financially, your money advisor might arrange for other less-savory special offers that can generate additional income, such as a missile test range.  For a price, landmark buildings such as the Empire State Building or the Great Pyramid are also available for installation in your city.  This is fun, but the landmarks don't actually do anything except make your skyline pretty.Bottom line: breathtaking graphics, cool music, and long hours of game play make this a great game, but make sure your computer meets the minimum technical requirements for installation.  Don't expect much personal interaction, a la The Sims, but do expect to become an addict to yet another absorbing simulation game.

SimCity 4 is, by far, the greatest city-building game yet released.  It wraps up all that is good from the previous SimCity games, puts a nice 3d look on everything, and adds complexity and features in just the right places.For the builders, SC4 does not disappoint.  It really gives a good sense of a thriving city.  Buildings are constructed in a very wide range of size and style, pedestrians walk the streets, car get into accidents, smog settles over the heavily industrialized areas, trees sway in the breeze, and waves roll up and down the beaches.  There is a slew of unlockable buildings and real-world landmarks to spruce up and personalize your town.  And even more stuff is available online when you've exhausted everything the game has to offer.  Even the disasters are beautiful!  Time was, you needed a pretty sweet PC to handle the game.  Nowadays the required hardware is pretty standard stuff and it still looks great.Other features help the player out too: things like elimination of power lines, automatic street placement, lots of charts / graphs / map overlays to ease analysis, improved pipelaying, etc. all help streamline the game and fix some of the worst annoyances in previous incarnations.The primary challenge of SimCity 4 is balancing.  There is so much complexity in the game, and much of your time is split between building up the city, balancing out the budget, and finding some way to manage all the problems that plague every major metropolis.  Some players are turned off by this as it can be frustrating to contend with all the issues.

It shows you utilization of your roads, and how your citizens get from point A to point B.  Without it, managing road maintenance and upgrades is nearly impossible.

Disappointing to say the least!  (Some third-party addons help stop some of the worst offenses: check Google for the Network Add-on Mod and see if that suits your needs)If you're a fan of city builders at all, you owe it to yourself to give SimCity 4 Deluxe a chance.  It is the current king of city-builders, can easily consume hours of your life, and still has a wide fanbase despite being released about five years ago.  Highly recommended.
SimCity 4 is, by far, the greatest city-building game yet released.  It wraps up all that is good from the previous SimCity games, puts a nice 3d look on everything, and adds complexity and features in just the right places.For the builders, SC4 does not disappoint.  It really gives a good sense of a thriving city.  Buildings are constructed in a very wide range of size and style, pedestrians walk the streets, car get into accidents, smog settles over the heavily industrialized areas, trees sway in the breeze, and waves roll up and down the beaches.  There is a slew of unlockable buildings and real-world landmarks to spruce up and personalize your town.  And even more stuff is available online when you've exhausted everything the game has to offer.  Even the disasters are beautiful!  Time was, you needed a pretty sweet PC to handle the game.  Nowadays the required hardware is pretty standard stuff and it still looks great.Other features help the player out too: things like elimination of power lines, automatic street placement, lots of charts / graphs / map overlays to ease analysis, improved pipelaying, etc. all help streamline the game and fix some of the worst annoyances in previous incarnations.The primary challenge of SimCity 4 is balancing.  There is so much complexity in the game, and much of your time is split between building up the city, balancing out the budget, and finding some way to manage all the problems that plague every major metropolis.  Some players are turned off by this as it can be frustrating to contend with all the issues.  I personally get a great deal of satisfaction when, for example, I sink a bunch of cash into an urban renewal project and actually manage to revitalize main street without everyone running for the hills.

Sim City 4 lets you create and run any kind of city you can think of. Will you build a small farming town or a massive metropolis? As mayor, you have a group of advisors who inform you of problems and other issues. A few of my friends who had never played any of the Sim City games were horrified when they looked at some screenshots on the back of the box and saw the hundreds of tiny houses that covered the citys, as they were under the impression that you had to individually place every little building. This is not so. Instead, you zone areas (as you would in real life) for certain types of buildings and the citizens will take care of the rest. You do choose where to build governmental buildings such as court houses, police stations, fire stations, hospitals, power plants, ect. This game does come with frustrations as well. Balancing your expenses can be very difficult. In this area, your cities are as realistic as the real thing. One decision leads to multiple others forcing you to make very careful choices. For example: You are trying to decide what you should invest your money in. Your trying to keep your monthly expenses below your monthly income which is already too close for comfort. Should you raise funding for the police station in the most heavily crime infested neighborhood in the city, or construct larger roads to lessen the horrible traffic in the residential area at the end of the highway? You could raise taxes or cut funding but less people will move to your city and cutting too much funding in one area will cause the employees to go on strike. The military will give you money if you let them build a missile testing site in your city, but doing this might start protests and riots. If your city becomes a disaster thats just too much to handle or if you just get tired of it, you can unleash tornados, astroids, giant robots, freak lightning storms, earthquakes and (my personal favorate) a giant UFO that can wipe out a large portion of your city with a big laser and then launches three tiny UFOs that shoot fireballs. This is a great game for people who love city builders and have the patience and decision making ability to keep your city from falling apart.

As I said in the title, this is not a review. I just want to save like-minded people some time, and summarize what makes 2005 different from the 2004 title.  While this isn't platform specific, the biggest upgrade this year is for the Xbox, as EA and Microsoft have finally settled, and online play has finally arrived via XBLive.  I'd like to not assign stars at all, but Amazon doesn't allow for pre-release non-reviews.  So I'm assigning 5 stars based on Madden 2004, and the promise of the following new features.  It is not meant to be commentary about the 2005 title.I've done this for NCAA 2005 as well, but decided to adapt it for Madden as well.  Everything in here is Madden-specific.GENERAL GAMEPLAY IMPROVEMENTS:- The hit stick:  The Hit Stick is a brand-new control innovation whereby players can attempt to lay a big hit on their opponent by flicking the right stick. They are risky, as a mis-timed hit can be devastating to your defense, but it can all pay off with a huge hit and a fumble or dropped pass.- Reworked DB play/pass defense:  Rebuilt from the ground up, with a focus on man-to-man coverage.  Good DBs will now blanket their receivers better than ever before, and "shut down" corners will now play as such.- All alternate team jerseys are now available.- Updated player models for more intense realism.- Reworked stadiums, fans, and environmental graphics.- New running animations.  "Over 1000 new animations added."FRANCHISE MODE IMPROVEMENTS:- Restricted Free Agents - Allow your young guys to test Restricted Free Agency.- Preseason Position Battles - Let two players who are similar in talent battle it out for the starting job.- Player Personalities - Players react to everything that happens to them and if things get really bad for them, they demand a trade. If you're not throwing the ball to your star receiver, you'll hear about it.- Franchise Tags - Tag players who refuse to re-sign with your team.- New Realistic Off-season Free Agency - Players no longer only care about money. They now look at your team, the players you have, your team prestige and lots of other factors.- Weekly Game-plan - Your coordinators provide you with a game-plan each week that contains keys to stop your upcoming opponents.- NFL Icons - They've acknowledged the stars in the NFL and they become Icons in your Franchise. These players influence free agents and affect morale if something happens to them.- Practice in Franchise - You can now practice with your current franchise team.- Improved Team Management - Teams intelligently manage their rosters now. They cut dead weight and sign regular season free agents.- Name Team Captains - You can now name your team captains every year in Franchise.- Rivalries - Rivalries are a new addition to Franchise this year.- Team Prestige - A new aspect of Franchise is prestige.

Breakout players are rewarded for their performance.- Improved Draft - A ticker, announcer and trading during the draft highlight our draft improvements.- Change Player Positions - You can change the positions of players in Franchise every season now.- Storyline Central is a new addition to Franchise Mode this year that focuses on every story that is at the forefront in the NFL. The stories around your team now impact your team. If the rookie RB is pushing the veteran for playing time but not getting it, his morale will drop and it will affect his performance. You hear about the stories three different ways.1) Newspaper. Every team in Franchise has a newspaper from their local city that discusses only the stories that pertain to that team. We also feature USA Today, which is the franchise's national newspaper. In USA Today, the most important stories from the entire NFL appear.2) EA Sports Radio. They've added sports talk radio to Franchise, where host Tony Bruno breaks down the week's biggest stories. Each week's show includes call-ins, coach and player interviews, trivia questions and from time to time, Tony will rant about important issues in the NFL.3) Email. Every week on your PDA, you'll receive emails about everything going on with your team. You will receive emails from players, coaches, general managers, the PR department, etc.- Create-a-fan:  Create your own dedicated crazy fans.  To be included during game-time celebratory animations.ONLINE PLAY IMPROVEMENTS:- Opponent scouting:  They've added a new scouting report that allows you to check any player's (online) tendencies. You can look at their favorite playbook and formation, as well as look at how much they no-huddle, call hot routes, and audible.  It's meant to try and cut down on the number of games wasted to opposition that cheats or otherwise plays in a manner you're not interested in.- Quick tournaments:  4 or 8 player tournaments built right into the online system.- Even team mode:  An option that will allow an even playing field, regardless of the `real world' strengths and weaknesses of two programs/teams.- Improved leaderboards.- "Rushing Attack" mini-game, as defined above.- EA Messenger:  Track dozens of friends online.That's all I've come across so far, but it's a factual aggregation of information, all directly from the source.  Either Electronic Arts, and/or Phil Frazier the line producer via an interview on EASports, much of the info is paraphrased or even partially or wholly quoted.  None of this comes through third parties, or speculation.  Given that, this looks to be one of the biggest leaps forward this franchise has enjoyed in some time.  Particularly for Xbox fans as they finally get online play, but really for everyone.  But enough, I now return you to your regularly scheduled, "tHiS gAMe iz dA bOMb!" 'reviews'.

I've been playing this year's version of Madden nonstop for about two months now and indeed it is a very great game.  Everyone already knows this.  But this review is for me to rant my dislikes of the game.  Although the defense has been completely revamped sometimes it seems as if the game is cheating.  Let me explain...the linebackers in this game are among the greatest ever.  They blanket fast wide receivers, cut on a dime, have DB like motions, excellent hand eye coordination, read routes in zone all dat, tackle everything etc.  But it gets to the point where they are breaking on outs WAY WAY TOO FAST.  They'll get out there and cover the out route on a receiver like they were Deion Sanders.  Sometimes they'll run the route for the receiver even breaking at the same time or even before the receiver does.  Ok that's not that unrealistic but then they won't JUST knock it down, they'll cut the corner (like they have DB speed!) jump ten feet in the air and pick it off.  And when they catch they're already 5 yards away from the reciever!  Sometimes I had a LB cover my slot receiver on a fly with no safety help and a play action.  Unrealistic.  That's strictly for the DB's.  And when you do run it the lb's are in the backfield before you can hand it off but when you pass they all in the passing lanes.And speaking of Dbs, their play is amazing.  DB's break on the ball incredibly fast...not unrealistic yet...but when you throw in a pump fake they don't even bite...and if you think you have your receiver open deep?  Forget about it...no matter the speed of your receiver the DB is always running step for step and they will, while runnin full speed trying to keep up, jump a 45 inch vertical flail around and knock the ball ( 100% of the time is underthrown by a human) down in single coverage.  If it is a safety overtop forget about it because he's never late breaking to that and almost always will knock it down or pick it off no matter if there's a post coming at him.  And if you do throw the post he's all over that as well knocking it down.And another thing when it's pass the D Line handles your o line tossing them around like ragdolls penetrating 3 yards in the backfield as soon as the ball is snapped forcing you to throw quick or scramble.  And if they blitz outside expect your tackle to be dumber than a box of rocks and let NOT ONLY ONE BUT TWO defenders run right by him and won't even attempt to lunge or nothing and let them kill my qb all game.  One thing that has been left out is that forward motion of the arm when the QB is hit and fumbles.  If your QB gets hit while throwing it's almost always ruled a fumble and they scoop it up score.  Your O Line, knowing that they let somebody through, won't come back and try to block the man so when it is a fumble they don't even know what's going on.  One time I got sacked and fumbled, ball was on the ground for like 2 or 3 seconds and not one O linemen turned around.  The QB was just laying there like a fool and didn't even attempt to get the ball back knowing that he just dropped it.  At least try to trip em up or something.  And guess what they ended up running for a touchdown. And when you do throw the whole secondary and LB's show up for the tackle..swarming.  If the computer gets hit while throwing the pass will still be completed 80% of the time.  No break on the ball by your DB.This wouldn't be so bad if your team did the same thing.  But unfortunately they do not.  You wanna man up a receiver with Chris McCallister?  No way.  Try to bump that receiver and he gives my CB a move and more often than not catches a slant or he gets beat deep even with the safety over the top he outruns everyone.  If you Try to manually control the CB and do as the computer does and jump ten feet high, and they'll just put their hand up still allowing them to catch it.  Sometimes they go up to bump a receiver and the receiver runs right around them.  That's not that bad...you can't get hands on them every play but the separation is like 5 or 6 yards when they miss and the computer ALWAYS hits the man that misses the bump.  It's crazy.  Playing regular man with no variation causes your corner back to get torched underneath but they are pretty good at not getting beat deep.  Playing off man is death unless they got a long way to go in a very short period of time.  So man isn't working let's go to a zone.Zone coverages more often than not work.  But if you get a play action expect your cover 3 corner to commit the number one cardinal rule in defensive back history; he'll get beat deep in cover 3.  Doesn't matter how fast your CB is the WR will eat up his cushion and will be next to him before he even turns to run and by that time the WR is already by him.  The safety done bit on something and the computer more often than not throws a perfect pass right over the WR's shoulders catching it in full stride and making your CB look stupid.  I've had this happen to me numerous times with like 10 seconds to go in the half, and they score on that BS.  Part of the reason your DB's and LB's don't break on the ball like the computer's is because the D Line is gettin mudded every play.  Their O line will pick up every blitz on all madden and will sometimes even pancake the blitzer and go pick up someone else. On the run they're pushing the line of scrimmage up three yards at the snap of the ball.  I mean they are getting blown off the ball...no penetration.And if you think your LB's will look up receivers and jump routes forget it.  You selling yourself wolf tickets.  They will let a WR run through three zones across the field and catch the ball right in front of them.  They usually drop to certain depths so when there's no underneath threat shouldn't they be looking for the deep in as the computer does?  Well...they SHOULD.  I find the computer catching 16 yard routes that would more often than not get PICKED when I run the same play.  And again no break on ball by safeties.  And in cover 2 the WR will run a 7 route and the safety won't move off the hash!  What's going on?!?!  Even with all that the game is very fun to play.  I can't put it down...even though the game cheats it doesn't cheat so much to make you wanna throw a controller if ya feel me.  I mean they'll do a play and you'll think to yourself "The game is cheating!" , but then you realize in the NFL people make spectacular plays or screw up and blow a coverage every now & then and the offense happens to exploit it, or they miss tackles.  Or they watched that film and they know that route and that reciever's tendencies.  So all in all...Madden is still madden...great gameplay, franchise mode, and head to head competition.  Fluid controls and good animations and graphics.  To me, it's better than ESPN football but hey that's just one man's opinion.*****additions******DB's break on the ball TOO FREAKING FAST!!!!!!!! One time I had a fly route and a post corner on the same side and the DB, with his back turned, somehow with his spidey-sense, sensed that the ball was being thrown to the post corner. He stopped on a dime, left the man he was guarding broke on the post corner and picked it off...almost took it to the crib. and the DB wasn't no Chris McCalister or Champ Bailey or Deion Sanders or Patrick Surtain or Will Allen...it was just some nobody. Everything is knocked down or picked off even when it's completely apparent that the receiver is open. DB's on deep balls jump (on time) before they even turn their head around and even before the reciever jumps and knocks the ball down. On top of that your receiver rarely even jumps...he just puts his hand up like the ball will magically fall into his hands. Even when you manually take control of the reciever the DB out jumps him while running full speed and not even looking at the ball. I've played cornerback and I know that you CANNOT jump that high unless you stop and plant and at least have an idea on where the ball is. You can't run full speed, jump ten feet in the air without looking for the ball AND knock it down 90% of the time and you don't even see the ball. You just can't do it. When have you ever seen a cornerback just out jump a receiver while looking at the ball let alone while he's trying to catch up to the receiver? That's right never. But when the computer throws a fade on your guy he doesn't even put his hand up and gets burnt on a straight fly and the receiver is not Moss. When have you seen man to man CB just simply get ran right past and burnt by five yards by a WR who is not faster or better than him? That's what happened to me. Chris McCalister on Hines Ward...he should be locked down. QB throwing perfect passes. Linebackers freakin manned up with a reciever (with no safety help overtop) on the post corner and jump 1000 feet in the air and break up the pass. And to make it so bad the QB underthrows it even when you step into the throw and the blitz is minimal.And speaking of blitzing...I may blitz seven people and just so happens everyone gets picked up. Once I blitzed 7, and the QB had time to PUMP FAKE and still get the throw off and complete the pass! What is that? But the computer might blitz three or four and the tackle won't even attempt to lunge at the Defensive End... it's really pitiful sometimes. And on running plays often not one but two blockers will run right by the guy that makes the tackle like they didn't even see him and on stretch plays the MLB will run right through the A gap untouched and tackle me the same time I get the ball (more than a couple times a game). I was playing the Steelers on all madden on 15 minute quarters to learn a new playbook and in the first quarter I was sacked 12 times and threw 6 interceptions and they had 6 tackles for loss. Jamal Lewis had like 90 yards on 15 carries and they still didn't even bite on the play action. That's just BS. And speaking of BS...how does a corner playing man to man bite on a play action? Someone please enlighten me. And on a play action how is my RB gettin tackled 8 yards down the field and no Pass Interference is called? And out routes are pretty much useless because the defensive players break on the ball too fast. Once I was on the goaline and ran a play action pass to Todd Heap, and the Steelers fourth string defensive end dropped in coverage but bit on the play action. Clearly beat, I lob the ball to Todd Heap in the corner of the endzone and amazingly the fourth string D. End ( rating is like 70) jumps off one foot and knocks a fade down in the corner of the endzone. That's when I just turned the game off. It made me mad to no end (it was fourth down!) yall wouldn't understand how mad that made me---cursing at the tv and everything! (This was today by the way) And when you do finally deliver the ball what do they do? They drop it (most likely a first down pass)! Most of the time without getting hit. But Burress comes through on a slant and stiff arms Ray Lewis and drags Boulware three yards down the field. WTF?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? They had Duce Staley break THREE yes THREE hit sticks in one play from first Ray Lewis (impossible!), then Ed Reed (a pro bowler), THEN anthony weaver and was finally ankle tackled by willie Demps. Sorry but Duce staley is not that good anymore.And speaking of broken tackles...expect at least one person on your kickoff team to miss a tackle and everybody else get blocked. But when they kickoff to you, your lone returner is left to fend off five defenders cus nobody on your team tried to block. And if they do happen to block and all you need is that one missed tackle...forget it your guy's goin down. In all my games of Madden 05 I have returned not ONE kickoff or punt (against the computer). I can barely average 18 yards a return. That's unnrealistic. I'll still play the game tomorrow though...what a game what a game.
I've been playing this year's version of Madden nonstop for about two months now and indeed it is a very great game.  Everyone already knows this.  But this review is for me to rant my dislikes of the game.  Although the defense has been completely revamped sometimes it seems as if the game is cheating.  Let me explain...the linebackers in this game are among the greatest ever.  They blanket fast wide receivers, cut on a dime, have DB like motions, excellent hand eye coordination, read routes in zone all dat, tackle everything etc.  But it gets to the point where they are breaking on outs WAY WAY TOO FAST.  They'll get out there and cover the out route on a receiver like they were Deion Sanders.  Sometimes they'll run the route for the receiver even breaking at the same time or even before the receiver does.  Ok that's not that unrealistic but then they won't JUST knock it down, they'll cut the corner (like they have DB speed!) jump ten feet in the air and pick it off.  And when they catch they're already 5 yards away from the reciever!  Sometimes I had a LB cover my slot receiver on a fly with no safety help and a play action.  Unrealistic.  That's strictly for the DB's.  And when you do run it the lb's are in the backfield before you can hand it off but when you pass they all in the passing lanes.And speaking of Dbs, their play is amazing.  DB's break on the ball incredibly fast...not unrealistic yet...but when you throw in a pump fake they don't even bite...and if you think you have your receiver open deep?

As I said in the title, this is not a review. I just want to save like-minded people some time, and summarize what makes 2005 different from the 2004 title.  While this isn't platform specific, the biggest upgrade this year is for the Xbox, as EA and Microsoft have finally settled, and online play has finally arrived via XBLive.  I'd like to not assign stars at all, but Amazon doesn't allow for pre-release non-reviews.  So I'm assigning 5 stars based on NCAA 2004, and the promise of the following new features.That aside (despite it being a huge issue), the following changes come directly from EA Sports announcements.  What follows is verifiable on their website or with a few well-placed Google searches.  I present it for convenience.  These 'pre-release reviews' that always pop up for titles might as well serve a real purpose, besides of course the all-important "tHIs gAme iS dEFiNaTEly (sic) gOInG tO RAwK!!!" proclamations.  But I digress, the summary follows, I intend to keep my personal commentary to an absolute minimum;GENERAL GAMEPLAY IMPROVEMENTS:- Big hits:  The option to take a chance on really plastering another player.  Increases the chance of a fumble or dropped pass, but also the chance of you whiffing on the tackle.- Improved run blocking and new run animations:  No more getting stuck against or behind your own linemen.  Good offensive lines now open better holes and routes.- Home Field Advantage:  The bigger the stadium, the louder the crowd, the greater the impact.  Pumping up the crowd carries more meaning and response.  Visiting teams have to fight an uphill battle against the environment, based upon the strength of the home team's stadium and crowd.- Interactive Timeouts: You're now given a choice on which group to coach, it can directly address ratings and composure levels depending on those of your team captains.  You can now "ice the kicker" with timeouts, as composure is an issue for all players.- Match-Up Stick:  Player ratings (in game) can now change based upon the individual's ability to handle pressure.  You can now check composure and mismatches pre-snap.- Custom fans:  Set up your own 'crazed' fans with a variety of options, accessories, appearances, etc.  To add to the college gameday atmosphere, and...- Custom celebrations:  Choose to play a mascot, fan or player animation, decide between mild and extreme.- More "user" stats:  User pick tracking was well received, now more stats are tracked in this form in your record book.DYNASTY MODE IMPROVEMENTS:- Roster expansion to 70 (according to the producer, although 75 has been reported elsewhere).  It's been down at 55 for years, which has been a source of frustration for those who enjoy dynasty mode.- Top 25 Stadiums tracking:  In dynasty mode, you can build home field advantage where there was little or none before, the top 25 places to play are tracked.- Team Captains:  As part of a deeply enhanced dynasty mode, you can now name captains.- Program integrity:  Dynasty depth - keep tabs on your players, you can now suffer academic issues and/or team rule violations.  You choose how to discipline, and you can now actually lose scholarships, television exposure, and post-season play if you don't run a clean program.  It also speaks to;- Player transfers:  You can now lose athletes to transfers if they're unhappy, and feel like they should be seeing the field more.  You can also have players from other programs request a transfer in if you're not deep at their position.- Recruiting pipelines:  You can now build your presence outside of your immediate geographic region.- Improved scouting:  You can now unlock prospect attributes without offering a scholarship first.- Better defined offensive/defensive coaching strategies:  Speaks to play-calling, simulation and recruiting.- Accurate conference schedule rotation.- Athletes:  You can now recruit a kid just for his athletic ability, and define or switch his position on the roster later.  If you have a QB who would make a better FS or WR, you can switch him, and he will progress according to his new position, not the old.- More/improved Sports Illustrated stories, magazine covers and insight throughout the season.- More trophies.  Added support for the Rimington and Doak Walker.  28 bowl trophies, 49 rivalry trophies.- All-Conference teams.  To supplement 1st and 2nd team All-American tracking.ONLINE PLAY IMPROVEMENTS:- Opponent scouting:  They've added a new scouting report that allows you to check any player's (online) tendencies. You can look at their favorite playbook and formation, as well as look at how much they no-huddle, call hot routes, and audible.  It's meant to try and cut down on the number of games wasted to opposition that cheats or otherwise plays in a manner you're not interested in.- Quick tournaments:  4 or 8 player tournaments built right into the online system.- Even team mode:  An option that will allow an even playing field, regardless of the `real world' strengths and weaknesses of two programs/teams.- Improved leaderboards.- Minigames.That's all I've come across so far, but it's a factual aggregation of information, all directly from the source.  Either Electronic Arts, and/or Rod Moye the producer via an interview on EASports.  None of this comes through third parties, or speculation.  Given that, this looks to be one of the biggest leaps forward this franchise has enjoyed in some time.  Particularly for Xbox fans as they finally get online play, but really for everyone.  But enough, I now return you to your regularly scheduled, "tHiS gAMe iz dA bOMb!" 'reviews'.

Given that, this looks to be one of the biggest leaps forward this franchise has enjoyed in some time.  Particularly for Xbox fans as they finally get online play, but really for everyone.  But enough, I now return you to your regularly scheduled, "tHiS gAMe iz dA bOMb!" 'reviews'.
*IMPORTANT* I am writing this review from the point of view of a fan of Head Coach '09, by EA Sports.I am not a Madden player. I don't get much thrill controlling the individual players on the field. I prefer the front office activity, the duties of the general manager and head coach, or even owner. I like scouting, drafting, free agency, dealing with the salary cap and various personnel decisions. I like building a team. I like turning a losing team into a winning team.Head Coach offered all those things. But Head Coach wasn't a hit. It had many failings. And I would be forever limited to the 2008 draft class. When I learned that some elements of Head Coach had been transferred to Madden 10, I decided to give Madden 10 a try. It was worth it.Madden 10 is NOT Head Coach. Some of the elements transferred; many did not. Still, for those who enjoyed Head Coach, Madden 10 is not a bad alternative. I will try to list some of major pros and cons here:PROs:* 2008 draft class* Better graphics* Yearly player progression report. This would have made Head Coach so much better. Here you can see how much your players have improved from the past season, not only in their overall score but in individual categories. And even players who do not improve overall might see improvements in skills such as awareness or route running.* Free Agency system. I liked free agency in Head Coach but Madden is better. Here you make offers and the players take those offers under advisement while other teams put in their offers. At the end of free agency you find out if you were able to make the offer attractive enough.* Ability to take control of players if you wish. At times, you can make a difference in a game if your players are repeatedly allowing the other team to run a type of play. In a real NFL game the coaches would make improvements. If you have the hand-eye coordination, you can make these changes yourself.* Snapping the ball. In Head Coach it becomes frustrating when your team won't snap the ball. You have no control over this. In Madden 10, if you're in a hurry-up offense, you can snap the ball and it won't snap when you don't want it to snap, which also sometimes happens in Head Coach. It's nice to have that level of control as a way to limit AI stupidity.CONs:* Draft isn't as good as Head Coach's.* Scouting. In Madden you scout individual players based on your scouting department's abilities. In Head Coach, you rely upon your GM who is rated in a variety of categories. Some might be better at scouting TEs and others defensive backs, for example. In Head Coach, as in real life, you can scout by schools and by position, allowing you to focus on individual players but also on entire college teams.* Position coaches. Madden 10 doesn't have position coaches, only HC, DC, OC, ST, scouting and trainer. They make some modifications to your play but the modifications in Head Coach are more comprehensive and it is easier to fine tune the type of team you want to play.* Lack of play books. Head Coach offers you various play books and offensive and defensive systems. Madden 10 is much more limited in this regard. You can run a 3-4 or a 4-3 in Madden 10 but there is no  potion for the 46, or for college-type spread offensives or run and shoot.* Kicking. In Madden 10 there is no way to have the AI do your kicking for you. I have a problem with keeping the joystick lined up to make my kicks go straight. I don't think my kicker's abilities should be handicapped by my lack of hand-eye coordination. It's not realistic. You can have the AI throw the ball for your QB but it won't kick for you. This is a serious draw-back.* Statistical Realism. Head Coach is a simulation, while Madden 10 is more of an arcade game with some simulation qualities. The players are supposed to be as good (or bad) as in real life and their stats should reflect this at season's end. I think Head Coach does a better job in this regard than Madden 10, which allows your hand-eye coordination to effect the outcome. Thus, you will see more outrageous 70+ scoring performances by teams, or rookie QBs like Stafford throwing an NFL record 8 touchdown passess in a game (which even I, with my less than stellar hand-eye coordination, managed to pull off)Neither game is perfect. Both have serious AI issues. The lack of a 2-minute drill is especially lacking in either game. Players know in the NFL to step out of bounds, to try to get out of bounds, etc, and the QB knows to throw to those players and not to some guy who not only has no chance of getting out of bounds but no chance of making meaningful yards. I've yet to see QBs or WRs operate this way in any EA Sports football simulation.If you want a more ultimate front office experience, then play Head Coach. That's what is central to its design. Madden is an arcade game with some of these elements thrown in and while they are in some respects superior to the old Head Coach design, they are not as comprehensive and seem more skeletal in nature.For a Head Coach 09 fan the biggest reason to play a Madden 10 franchise is not the front office framework, but the improved graphics and the 2009 draft class.
This will be broken up into two sections:  The actual product review and ideas to improve the play for next year:PRODUCT REVIEW:Since it's release,NHL 09has left many hockey-mad gamers "chasing the dragon."  Though the title came out, revolutionized hockey video games, and monopolized the hockey game market; many players have been wondering if EA will ever manage to outdo itself again.  When I reviewedNHL 12, I indicated it was comprehensive, but that the overall gaming experience left a lot to be desired.  I originally wrote a gushingNHL 13review based off the demo until the gameplay pulled me back to reality and forced me to give it an average review; which lead to me testing this out one more thoroughly so I didn't repeat the same mistake again.  So how does NHL 14 fare?  Some of the gaming could stand improvement, but this is the best title since NHL 09.One of the improvements that EA touted this year is that the goaltending AI has been refined to do a better job at anticipating the shot.  This may not seem like a huge deal to your casual gamer, but this is an IMMENSE BOON for anyone who plays the goaltending position regularly (like myself.)  I can finally say that the goaltending AI doesn't want to surrender a goal on every 9 shots taken by the computer.  Instead, you're now in control of making sure you've covered the angle (which is a challenge in itself) while your goaltending AI does a better job of stopping the shot.  This, along with the anticipation feature that was introduced in NHL 13 and the butterfly function, allows a human-controlled goaltender to be in the game just as well as the computer goaltender. There are certainly some defensive deficiencies that the AI-controlled players on the human-player team experience (more on that later), but the improvements in the goalie functions allow for you to overcome that through most games.The new fighting engine flat out ROCKS!  Though the fighting is in third-person now instead of first-person, the fighting now occurs as a direct result of what happens in the game and not just through instigating a fight using the Triangle button.  Take a shot at a goalie when the whistle's blown or lay out a massive hit to a star player?  You better be ready to defend yourself!  What's more is that there can be multiple altercations at once, so if you're playing with and against others online, it's entirely possible to have a full-on line brawl.  The fact that there can be multiple fights at once makes it better than in the games of the past, but there aren't any instigator penalties handed out for third-man-in fights and players aren't thrown out of a game if there's a second altercation (this should be changed to both make it true to life, but your casual gamer probably won't care either way.)Be A Pro has had a facelift as of this season and is now known as Live The Life.  In addition to playing out your pro's career, you're now tasked with saying and doing all of the political things a player does to ensure their popularity improves amongst the fans, management, teammates, and their families.  Say the right things and your endorsement deals begin to appear, fans chant your name, your teammates and family love you, and management wants to give you the contract you deserve.  If you say the wrong things, you'll end up traded to a different team, which can have a detrimental affect on other things.  Though most of this was spot on, one thing I didn't care for was that any answer that bashed the team somehow raised the player's popularity amongst the fans.  Maybe I'm a minority, but I'm not going to cheer for a guy who bashes his team.  Otherwise, the new features make an already fun game mode even more fun to play.The Be A GM feature has had some revisions as well in this year's game.  You can set the trade difficulty to be separate from the difficulty of the gameplay and the difficulty of the franchise mode.  You can also grant the AI more control to administer the team to the point where the only necessary human interaction is scouting; as even goalie rotation can be handled by the AI now (I suppose EA could have simulated scouting as well but what's the point of playing the game if the AI's going to play if for you?)  Thanks in part to the lower salary cap, there's a significantly better chance of catching a big free agent during the off-season then there was playing last year's title.  However, as the salary cap inflates, teams will be more likely to retain star players through the ability of being able to bury salary without giving other teams the option to claim the players; leaving either depth-role prime-aged players or veteran-aged castoffs with declining ability as the only options to be made available through free agency as the game goes on.  The fact that teams can circumvent the waivers through the pre-season roster management presents a hole in the game that can stand to be patched; I'll make a suggestion for this later on.  The only other problem with the Be A GM mode is that injuries intensify the deeper your roster is; so it's like you're being punished for actually building your AHL team as well.The game has other features and improvements as well.  Winter Classic has been expanded a bit to give you the option as to which venue you wish to play at (meaning either the Winter Classic '11 or Winter Classic '12.)  The NHL 94 mode provides a retro-style hockey experience complete with simplified controls, old-school soundtrack, and the classic celebrations whenever you score.  You can select your position prior to accepting a drop-in game when playing online.  The soundtrack has gotten more rockin' again, as it was great to see Soundgarden and Bullet For My Valentine on the soundtrack (I do wish Blackguard would come back though!)Otherwise, the gameplay hasn't changed drastically.  Taking face-offs in this game has never been smoother, so that was a very happy surprise in comparison to previous seasons.  Dishing out body checks feels more real-to-life in that your larger players can steamroll the smaller players, but larger players can also be adversely affected by poor balance as well.  This remains a shooters game for those of you who prefer to put the puck onto the net.  The passing isn't terrible, but there seems to be a difference between executing a pass within a game and executing a pass online; so it could stand revamping.So with that all that said, this title is excellent for the casual gamer and great for the gamer with slight or moderate interest in hockey.  If you're looking for a fun hockey title that's better than the more recent titles and updated from NHL 09, then this is the game to get.ROOM TO IMPROVE:Though this is excellent for casual gamers and well enough for those who are interested in hockey, this game can still cause frustration for the hardcore hockey gamer who's sees the annual NHL installment the way most gamers currently look atGrand Theft Auto V.  The leaps and bounds shown this season was awesome and shouldn't be discounted, but there's always room to grow.  With that said, here's what I'd like to see for next year:-  The passing engine should be revamped, as the AI has an easier time connecting passes then human-controlled players do.  I would love to see the passing being done with R2+Right Paddle, where the strength of the pass could be determined by how hard the paddle was pressed in that direction (the pass could be cancelled by releasing the R2 button without having executed the pass.)-  Change the defensive players for the human-controlled teams in the goaltender Live The Life mode to be better than movable pylons.  The back-checking should be more aggressive and the players should intentionally get into the passing lanes.  Playing as a goaltender, there's still too many instances of "cheap" goals that get scored against a human goaltender where the defense breaks down and leaves the goaltender on their own because no one's coming back to play any semblance of defense; if your player's already positioned there then it's fine, but the AI won't do it as a reaction to the gameplay.As a general example, I often find myself in the situation where the opposition will come up the rush and while my defender will be on them up to the defensive-zone face-off circle, the defender will actually turn away from the play and head for the boards, giving the attacking forward the opportunity to set up his shot without interference.  The attacking player will go to an area inside the dot where it's too far to poke-check but too close to commit to the butterfly; often resulting in a goal.  In a more specific example, I was playing as a member of the Winnipeg Jets facing the Anaheim Ducks.  Though I successfully poke-checked Corey Perry twice, he still scored on the third attempt in the same sequence because AI-controlled 6'5" Dustin Byfuglien can't break past 5'10" Kyle Palmieri to make a defensive play because the latter's stick checking was too intense; even though they were 3 feet away.  This goal was followed up by a 2-0 in my direction after the face-off because apparently, having a goal scored on you makes your teammates forget how to play defense.  (I could complain that my AI-controlled centers win 10% of their defensive zone face-offs, but the resulting shots are low-percentage so I really can't moan about the stat fluffing.)Further, if the coaching options are changed by the player during the game, the game should maintain those settings instead of changing them.  It's frustrating when you begin to realize this occurred when the opposing team begins to attack and your players aren't responding the way they had previously (I'll set the offensive pressure to Aggressive and the team will play fine, but then the AI will change it to Defend Lead, where my team loses the ability to skate the puck past the red line.)- Revamp the Be A GM mode to give the GM a more realistic gameplay.  There should be a full-on training camp for the preseason mode with an intra-squad scrimmage followed by 6 or 7 pre-season games where you can have up to 50 players (either on one-way, two-way, minor, or ATO/PTO contracts) where you can cut or designate them for assignment after each game; players who aren't waiver-exempt would be available to be claimed by the other teams instead of stashed in the minors as they are currently prior to the start of the season.  There should be an option to allow GMs to manage their minor league teams as well.  GMs should be able to add no-trade or no-movement clauses to contracts so they can negotiate better terms with their players.  Much like the Live The Life mode, the GM should be able to receive positive (or negative) performance boosts based on their actions.  Finally, an assistant GM upgrade (which would increase the chances of a trade being accepted/give better feedback on trades) would be better than adjusting trades to be done either easy, medium, or hard (I wholly admit I requested to see the option of selecting trade difficulty independently of the difficulty in the game in my prior reviews; but now that I've seen it in action, I have a preference towards wishing to see an Assistant GM upgrade that could provide detailed feedback as to whether or not a trade would be accepted by the opposition. As you upgrade your Assistant GM, you'd get better feedback on a trade along with better chances that a trade would be accepted, regardless of the trading block settings.)  Perhaps the AHL veteran limit could be imposed to prevent teams from stockpiling talent.-  With the online drop-in game, actually divide the rooms based on skill level. Have a drop-in room for amateurs, rookies, et al, in addition to an Open Skate room for players of all skill levels.  I hate seeing newer players get bullied by those who dedicate their lives to EA NHL games because it discourages the newer players from getting better; but the established players don't deserve to see their stats suffer because the other players aren't at their skill level, either.  Open Skate means you run the risk of getting jeered by the jerks with mics or having your stats suffer because a level 56 goalie's leaking like a sieve.  And if an amateur player is able to upgrade their equipment to boost their stats, then either they dedicated that much time to playing the Live The Life mode or they were willing to open their wallets to purchase the upgrades; both of which seem fair to me.-  Finally, can EA get the KHL on-board?  Could Live The Life see a player go to Europe instead of any of the North American leagues?  I would love to see these refinements as well.

System Shock 2 is hard to categorize, because it blends several genres and styles of games so well. It's a Role-Playing First-Person Shooter Science Fiction Survival/Horror game, with some extra twists here and there. If you wished Half-Life was more like Deus Ex, or you wanted to play the more violent and scary parts of Thief with 22nd century firepower, this is the game you want to play.Though it's getting a bit dated now, this game was far enough ahead of its time to still be very playable. Where the original System Shock made history as a remarkably immersive story-driven first-person shooter, the sequel goes even further with complex character development elements usually only seen in role-playing games. The graphics scale up smoothly enough to still look impressive on today's faster, higher resolution (and higher polygon count) displays, the sound is of sufficient quality to still be just as effective as most newer, more technically advanced productions, and of course, a great story is never obsolete.Once you get into a game this immersive, you forget about the technical details that may no longer be as cutting-edge as they once were. Just turn off the lights, plug in your headphones (or surround-sound if you have it), and try to stay alive. If you happen to forget that it's just a game, this one can really scare you. Definitely not for the faint of heart.The biggest flaw in this game is that the developers just didn't have enough time to fully flesh-out and polish some of the later parts.  Certain areas are just less expansive and detailed and finely-tuned than others.  The game doesn't significantly suffer from what's missing.  It just could have been that much better.By far the most common complaint about this game is that the weapons break too fast.  Personally, I don't consider that a flaw.  I like the extra stress factor of having to keep an eye on the condition of my weapons.  Unlike most First-Person Shooters, your resources are very limited in this game.  Throughout most of the game, you will very rarely have enough ammo to stop worrying about making every shot count.  There are a limited number of weapons available, and if you keep firing one until it jams, you have to either expend other resources to fix it or deal with the fact that you have one less gun to work with.If you really don't like worrying about broken weapons, there is a way to reduce or completely disable weapon deterioration.  It's not a menu option you can switch on and off within the game, but the release notes file on the CD explains how to do it, and it's not difficult.One complaint I've heard about the end of this game is that there are two "final battles" at the end, and the second one is disappointingly easy.  I didn't feel that way because I recognized that the first final battle was the climax, and then when there was one more confrontation after that, I thought of it as more of an epilogue than a challenge.  This is something gamers just aren't used to, and the only other game I've played that had an "epilogue" after the final confrontation was Half-Life, which has been accused of having the worst ending of any game ever.  The ending of System Shock 2 isn't nearly that bad, but it can be disappointing if the relatively short final areas have left you expecting more.Unfortunately, due to the particular circumstances of the closing of the company that developed the game, Looking Glass Studios, it is very unlikely that there will ever be a third System Shock game.

EDIT**: I've been playing the game for several days now, and I can say that it has lived up to all of my expectations (see preview below).  While you can't control as mnay troops as in Rome:Total War (we may need to look for a LOTR mod in the future), BFME has its own little niche, and it's a very nice one at that.  Inevitably the comparison to RTW will be made, but these are two very different games.  In RTW, you can control thousands of low-poly troops, but in BFME, you control hundreds of very high poly soldiers, each with very detailed animations and emotions.  Yes, the emotions are a nice part of the game.The graphics are beautiful- they really bring the Middle Earth world to life, especially with the settings maxed out.  Howard Shore's score also adds a great side to the game, with some additional remixing that sounded quite good.  Voice acting was also pretty good, although you can tell in some parts that they didn't really use Viggo for Aragorn.Gameplay; I like the new use of veterancy, which puts a crimp on players who rush to build every single building possible, and just pump out units.  Cavalry in the game is very powerful, so you'll need to group your men into the right formation.  Formations do give some help in BFME, although flank attacks and tactical maneuvers are unheard of, unlike RTW.  All the battles are faithfully recreated, including a mission to defend the fellowship and Lothlorien from marauding Moria orcs (one of the scenes cut from the extended edition of FOTR).  The Helms Deep mission is fantastic- it brings all the rigor, stress, and excitement as portrayed in the movie and books.The heros are a hoot to use; especially Gandalf, who seems a bit overpowered.  A pity the completed Sauron model cannot be played, and in general, it seems that the forces of Evil have fewer Heros than the forces of Light.The single player campaign missions are very delightful; you can basically replay the steps of the Fellowship or of the Dark Lord, but of course with your own little additions.  The multiplayer maps are wonderful, with maps taken from all the geographical locations in middle earth.Conclusion: A very enjoyable RTS game, that fully immerses you into the ME universe.  My only gripe is that the Command Points threshold is set too low, but you can mod the particular file to change that.  However, the low command points number was probably set at that level to prevent gameplay lag; at the Battle of Care Andros, with several hundred troops on screen (and despite have 1 gb of PC-4200 ram) I experienced some lagging effects.  Sprint, don't run to get your copy NOW!  What are you doing wasting time reading my review?  Get it! :P----------------------------------------------------------------To say that Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle-Earth looks amazing would be an understatement; it looks fantastic and unbelievably good!  I am highly anticipating its release on November 15th, and based on what the EA team has shown us thus far, it looks like all of their hard work has come to fruition.  Based on an upgraded version of the C&C;: Generals engine, LOTR:BFME brings you into the Middle Earth universe in glorious 3-D, with the capability to zoom-in onto the battlefield for those intense hand-to-hand melees.  Of course, there will be those detractors who suggest that BFME is nothing but Generals ported into Middle Earth; in some ways, that's true.  A lot of the great features of Generals are retained in BFME, and then some.  The EA team has added unique touches, as well as a greater emphasis on tactics, rather than the massed tank rushes that most RTS players are used to.  In addition, there are a multitude of unique features and immersive environments that make BFME really come alive.First, the maps and general gameplay.  Gone is the traditional style of RTS with big menus that take up the lower half of your screen.  In its place is a context-driven menu, which takes up far less space, and allows the player to bask in the beauty of the BFME engine.  It looks extremely intuitive; by clicking on a building, 6-7 options will form in a circle around your cursor, allowing you to just move the mouse slightly to select an option.  Base building appears to consist of 6-7 buildings built on pre-fabbed sites inside a protective wall, with additional buildings being allowed to be built outside of the wall.  Each of the buildings is true to the movie, and conceived in enormous detail that really lends to the atmosphere.  For instance, the Orc slaughterhouse, Orc pits, Warg ranges, and Gondorian archery range.  Zooming into the slaughterhouse, you can see the orc butcher cackle with glee and rub his hands together as he whistles for a cow to come up the ramp.  He kills it, and carries the steak to hang on a rack outside.  Or in the pits, you can see the head Orc prodding the mud with his rod, bringing up a `baby' Orc/Uruk-Hai that slides down the ramp and gets a sword and trudges out.  Or at the Warg range, you see an orc clamber onto a Warg, and walk out of a corral.  At the Gondorian archery range, the splendid architecture of the once Numenorians is visible in the smallest bricks.  You can actually see Gondorian longbow men practicing inside the courtyard, shooting at targets and such.  You can play as Rohan or Gondor or Mordor or Isengard; not sure about the Easterlings though.Second, the units are true to the movie and fashioned in great detail.  Buildings can be upgraded with earned points to achieve veterancy and thus pump out more advanced units. The Gondorian archery range can produce regular longbow men, but as the building is upgraded, it can produce say Faramir's rangers (which are a bit like the American pathfinders in C&C;: Generals), and what look like upgraded rangers with stealth ability.  The Gondorian barracks can produce regular footsoldiers on level 1, but when upgraded to level 2 and above, can procure the more elite Fountain guards.  The forces of evil are generally like the Chinese in Generals; infantry is either really cheap, or free, and orcs are continually coming out of the pits with no extra help from the player.  There are of course, hero units as well!  Units seen so far include Gandalf, Eomer, Theoden, Faramir, and Aragorn.  No word yet on evil heroes.Third, the EA team has decided to add a bit more of a tactical element than was present in Generals.  While a group of Gondorian infantry can easily defeat a horde of orcs, (and when they do win, they break out into cheers, thus giving a +1 to their attack), they run away or quake in their boots at the mere sight of a mountain troll picking up a tree to smash them into the ground.  That fear subtracts a -1 from their attack.  Even the elite Fountain guards with their pikes are no match for the mountain troll and his ad hoc tree-club.  But you can group your men into having the archers stand on the inside, while surrounded by Fountain Guards, and thus easily take down a troll.  It also looks like you can fully recreate the sieges at Helms Deep and Minas Tirith, and play on the Fields of Pelennor.Fourth, one item that is a nice carry-over from Generals is what appears to be Generals points.  If playing as Mordor, and you kill 100 Gondor soldiers, your catapaults can fire the heads of those unfortunate men at your enemies for an added attack bonus.  Or, you can call in Eagles or Nazgul to pick up hapless infantry and dash them into the ground.  Probably the most interesting Generals unit is the Balrog, which looks extremely powerful at the moment.  Not only can he stomp around and crush the peons, but he can crush a unit into ashes, shoot fireballs from his mouth, and with his very appearance, burn everything around him to a crisp.If you're a fan of the movies and RTS games, this is definitely one game that you do NOT want to miss!  Place your pre-order today!  And no, I'm not a plant, just an overly excited fan with too much time on his hands.
EDIT**: I've been playing the game for several days now, and I can say that it has lived up to all of my expectations (see preview below).  While you can't control as mnay troops as in Rome:Total War (we may need to look for a LOTR mod in the future), BFME has its own little niche, and it's a very nice one at that.  Inevitably the comparison to RTW will be made, but these are two very different games.  In RTW, you can control thousands of low-poly troops, but in BFME, you control hundreds of very high poly soldiers, each with very detailed animations and emotions.  Yes, the emotions are a nice part of the game.The graphics are beautiful- they really bring the Middle Earth world to life, especially with the settings maxed out.  Howard Shore's score also adds a great side to the game, with some additional remixing that sounded quite good.  Voice acting was also pretty good, although you can tell in some parts that they didn't really use Viggo for Aragorn.Gameplay; I like the new use of veterancy, which puts a crimp on players who rush to build every single building possible, and just pump out units.  Cavalry in the game is very powerful, so you'll need to group your men into the right formation.  Formations do give some help in BFME, although flank attacks and tactical maneuvers are unheard of, unlike RTW.  All the battles are faithfully recreated, including a mission to defend the fellowship and Lothlorien from marauding Moria orcs (one of the scenes cut from the extended edition of FOTR).  The Helms Deep mission is fantastic- it brings all the rigor, stress, and excitement as portrayed in the movie and books.The heros are a hoot to use; especially Gandalf, who seems a bit overpowered.  A pity the completed Sauron model cannot be played, and in general, it seems that the forces of Evil have fewer Heros than the forces of Light.The single player campaign missions are very delightful; you can basically replay the steps of the Fellowship or of the Dark Lord, but of course with your own little additions.  The multiplayer maps are wonderful, with maps taken from all the geographical locations in middle earth.Conclusion: A very enjoyable RTS game, that fully immerses you into the ME universe.  My only gripe is that the Command Points threshold is set too low, but you can mod the particular file to change that.

Here's the short version.The game is truly addictive. Even with all the bugs, crashes to desktop, warm reboots, and all the other associated problems, you will find yourself coming back to this game again and again. This game will make you feel powerful and 10 minutes later you'll be screaming at the monitor over a wacky death.After having just finished my 1st week trial subscription (each full game comes with a special code, give it to your friends to try out for a week free) I have some lucid thoughts to put down here for anyone interested. The planet Auraxis is colonized by the enormous Terran Republic, but after the wormhole that transported this group here collapses the main populace soon begins to break apart into 3 separate factions. The Terran Republic (TR) loyalists, the New Conglomerate (NC), which is a group of revolutionaries that want freedom from the TR, and the Vanu Sovereignty (VS) that have embraced the technologies of an ancient race who have left thier artifacts behind. Because of the Vanu technology there is no permanent death here on Auraxis. You are basically reconstructed with nanites in a cloning tube where you can feel free to rejoin battle at any time over several different continents each with thier own terrain differences and climates.You begin at Battle Rank 1 (BR) and after training on the various weapons and discovering new systems you gain exp. Each new BR you achieve gives you Certification Points, which you can spend on several different options, like being able to drive certain tanks or aircraft, or to better customize yourself to infantry work. In addition to this you can gain Command Ranks, which give you the ability to organize and direct offense and defense on a truly global scale. Command Rank is much harder to achieve though, so by and large the average player you'll find concentrates almost solely on BR. If you don't like what you're certified in (you can't fly a plane to save your life or die remarkably quick in infantry positions) no worries, you're given the option to "forget" certain skill and apply them to new ones.Combat often gets chaotic, and as your skills improve you can deal out more harsh damage on the battlefield. There's nothing more gratifying than getting kills in this game, and the harder the kill it is the more exp. you get. As such battles get *very* big really quick as the experience points pour in. To describe the game itself though I'd have to say that it's a mixture of Team Fortress Classic, combined with a little bit of Deus Ex, and further mixed up with some Battlefield 1942. It's definitely unique and that's it's biggest draw.As for the problems, I won't lie. The game has terrible bug issues...the worst I've come across in my week's trial subscription were crashes to desktop. Those are annoyingly frequent (and due to some terribly bad luck) usually at a time when I need to be in the game the most. Other times the game will freeze without warning, requiring you to reboot. And still other times consoles don't work right, or weapons don't load up correctly. Sometimes you respawn not in a cloning chamber like you're supposed to, but in water, where you drown and die again.This game is made for a certain kind of game player. If you love First Person Shooters like Half-Life, Return to Castle Wolfenstein, or Battlefield 1942, you will love this game. If you liked Deus Ex you will probably like this game. If you like the above games but are over the age of 30 and don't like getting spanked regularly by highstrung 15 year olds with the gift of agility, you will hate this game, but you'll keep playing it, probably cursing the whole time as I did. There's also some imbalance in the game...actually there's one GIANT imbalance in the game. The VS Lasher, that faction's "special" weapon is overwhelmingly too powerful. So if you subscribe and join the VS you'll find conquests to be less challenging than you would with the TR or NC, save for nights when they're actually organized to do something.Someday I'll buy the full version of Planetside...it's a really entertaining (and ludicrously enfuriating at the same time) romp from SOE. You may want to wait a month or two for the worst of the bugs to get worked out, but if you can't wait that long I can't blame you.

Quite simply, System Shock 2 is the greatest PC game ever, at least in my opinion.  There are many similarities to Half-Life in terms of gameplay, but Half-Life, as good as it is, pales in comparison to this masterpiece from the now defunct Looking Glass Studios.  The atmosphere of this game is nothing short of incredible.  The experience is as immersive as its two-dimensional constraints allow.  You don't just run and shoot your way through this one.  You have to examine everything, from the ceiling to the floor, and there is a wealth of items to examine, pick up, gain information from, and use.  Controlling your character takes a little getting used to, given the spatial elements of the game.  I use the old Magic Carpet method--right hand on the mouse and left hand on the arrow keys.  Some folks have said the game is able to generate real scares; I can't say it really scared me, but there were a few times that it made me jump.  When one of those hybrids sneaks up on you from behind and moans in your ear, it can indeed be rather startling. The AI is just superb--these creatures don't just stumble around haphazardly; things come at you from directions you don't expect.  If you allow security to be alerted to your presence and can't get to a security station, you better find yourself a corner and try to look in every direction all at the same time until the alert ends.This game could not be as great as it is without a great storyline.  While players of the initial System Shock may immerse themselves a little easier in the gameplay, new gamers will quickly be pulled into the world of the Von Braun.  It's classic sci-fi, in my opinion.  If you are worried about getting through the game quickly and relegating it to your "games I will probably never play again" stack, dispense with your fears.  The System Shock 2 universe is huge, and it will take you untold hours to see the game to its very end.  On several occasion, I thought the game was about to end, but it just kept going and going.  If you do finish it, you may very well want to start all over; you can choose any of three different types of characters, so you can get three different experiences guaranteed.  I hate to think how many hours of sleep I have missed playing this game; you just can't pull yourself away from it without an effort.As some reviewers point out, this game can be pretty difficult.  The first two-thirds are not really too bad but may well take you a long time to complete; the final one-third of the game does get downright arduous, though.  I'm the kind of wuss that can only play on the easiest level, and I can't see how anyone can finish this game without cheating--I can't even imagine how impossible a task it must be to play at the highest difficulty level.  I don't endorse cheating, but I was so anxious to see more of the game that I had to resort to dastardly measures.  Toward the very end, I sadly had to resort to God mode; had I not, I would be spending a number of years trying to finish this game.Play System Shock 2.  (...)This may well be the best value in all of gaming.  Don't worry about the fact this game was produced way back in 1999; it stands up to and surpasses any other game I have seen on the market today.  I really cannot understand why this game was not one of the biggest sellers in history.  I read nothing but rare praise from critics in the business (unheard of ratings like 97 out of 100),  and the game actually lives up to its promise.  The sales figures of the original System Shock were disappointing, but the lack of popular acclaim for this sequel is tragic.  The fact that Looking Glass Studios is now no longer in existence is heartbreaking because it means there will probably be no System Shock 3.

As the Sequel to MoH: Frontline I tought MoH: Rising sun would be the best game EVER, but I soon dicovered that it was nothing more than a cheezy scam in order to make money, the best part of the whole game is the opening, when your in Pearl Harbor defending a ship. And that's vaguely satisfying.MoH:The Rising Sun is a terrible game stemming from what seemed like a great Idea, I mean it looks so awesome on the commercials, but it really isn't that great, MoH:RS (Rising Sun) is very short, only a couple of missions.The graphics are maybe a little better than they were in Frontline but not noticable to the untrained eye.Really MoH:RS had loads and LOADS of potential, but it was put out onto the market not only too early, but too expensively, I mean the game is just a little bit longer than a demo for SOCOM or MA:GitS, its a terrible game, that seems like there was barely any effort put into it.RENT this game if you are interrested, but as a warning, it's not really worth the rental money. In summary MoH:RS is a great concept carried out terribly and severely poorly made, this game was a waiste of time and money to the producers, and a waiste of money to you and, if it was long enough, a waiste of time.

1998 saw the release of Medievil on the Playstation. It was a fantastic game and top of the platform genre, rivalled only by Crash Bandicoot and possibly Wild 9. It was set in Medievil times, obviously, and, although a bit easy, was value for money as it is an enjoyable game from start to finish. The only glitches are the already mentioned lifespan of the game and a few camera angles.Fast-forward two years and the sequel is somewhat dissapointing. Gone are the atmospheric, 'MEDIEVIL' levels such as 'The Sleeping Village', 'The Pirate Ship', the time zone one and the one in the castle. Instead we have a museum, an observitory and Kew Gardens. These levels were nowhere near as good as the ones in the previous game, for they had a lot more atmosphere and had a more Medievil style about them. There were still a few glimpses of the levels from the first game, Kensington (The Sleeping Village perhaps?), Cathedral Spires and Wulfrum Hall are the highlights of the game.Apart from the above, there are no major differences. The camera angles are just as good, but can be just as bad. The control of the character is exactly the same and there is little change in the graphics. The major letdown is the length. After the challenge of the first game, this was even easier to complete. If you have the choice of buying a top class platformer then I strongly recomend Medievil 1 or Crash 3 though these can be a little easy. If your looking for a challenging platformer then buy Wild 9.I know I've slated the game quite badly in this review, but it is still a lot better than some games I've played. A 'b-grade' platformer verging on the edge of 'A'. A few more levels and this is one of the best games ever but after the superb original, this is a little dissapointing.
1998 saw the release of Medievil on the Playstation. It was a fantastic game and top of the platform genre, rivalled only by Crash Bandicoot and possibly Wild 9. It was set in Medievil times, obviously, and, although a bit easy, was value for money as it is an enjoyable game from start to finish. The only glitches are the already mentioned lifespan of the game and a few camera angles.Fast-forward two years and the sequel is somewhat dissapointing. Gone are the atmospheric, 'MEDIEVIL' levels such as 'The Sleeping Village', 'The Pirate Ship', the time zone one and the one in the castle. Instead we have a museum, an observitory and Kew Gardens. These levels were nowhere near as good as the ones in the previous game, for they had a lot more atmosphere and had a more Medievil style about them. There were still a few glimpses of the levels from the first game, Kensington (The Sleeping Village perhaps?), Cathedral Spires and Wulfrum Hall are the highlights of the game.Apart from the above, there are no major differences. The camera angles are just as good, but can be just as bad. The control of the character is exactly the same and there is little change in the graphics. The major letdown is the length. After the challenge of the first game, this was even easier to complete. If you have the choice of buying a top class platformer then I strongly recomend Medievil 1 or Crash 3 though these can be a little easy.

I realized when I first heard about this game, that this is the type of game that I will love. I love the idea of making decisions that affect the world around me, and that it had adult themes. I loved that it was not the usual shooter, RPG, or Science Fiction game. It was something completely different, and I found that refreshing. There are some issues with the game, but the game is a welcome change to all of the other games out there. Here are what I thought were the pros and cons:PROS:Heavy decisions. Some of the decisions were honestly hard to make for me. I loved that feeling of what certain decisions would have on me.No "Game Over". I love that the game just continues if you fail at certain things, or do not do certain things, or even if a character dies.ARI. This is what the detective uses to investigate a crime scene. This was the only, small sci-fi part, but I loved it. It was cool to work with it, and see it in action. Great idea. I wish I was able to use it even more!Timed Responses. I loved that I only had a specific period of time to make a decision. I know this is nothing new, but it is always welcome.Emotions. Believe me or not, but this was the first game that I ever played that I seemed to actually care for characters. I could feel certain pain, and happiness. This probably is because I recently became a new father, but it was very emotional at times for me.Replay Value. After I finished my first play-through I immediately wanted to try different things to see different results and endings. I have never really felt a need to play a game a second time until Heavy Rain. Also, it has downloadable content. My amazon purchase gave me the first episode free, which I have played through twice already. It was a short, but very nerve-wracking experience. I can't wait for more episodes.  UPDATE: They announced that this will be the only DLC as they focused on adding Move Support.Graphics. The graphics were stunning many areas, including how characters moved. Everything seemed natural. There were a few tiny hiccups, but I loved the look of the game.Mature Content. It was nice to see mature content done in non explicit manner in a game. What I mean about "mature content" has nothing to do with age, or simply nudity. It deals with real emotions, and real characters. It's more then simply anger and humor that many other games only deal with. I really enjoyed this.Automatic Saves: I loved how the game saved automatically, specifically after certain decisions. Yes, I could go back and choose the chapter over again, but what's the fun in that?CONS:QTEs. If you don't like Quick Time Events, where you have to do certain movements quickly, this will be frustrating for you. This is a very large part of the game. I didn't mind it, but this could be a huge con for some people.Graphic Stutters: I noticed a few graphic stutters. The game also crashed on me once. Luckily the game saved automatically right before. Apparently, this does not affect all copies, however.Game Length: The game is short. It probably took me about 7 hours my first playthrough. If all you are looking for is one playthrough, don't care about DLC, then I strongly suggest to rent this game.Voice Acting: Simply put, the voice acting is terrible for the most part. There is real emotion there, but you can easily tell that English is not most of the characters main language. That took away a little bit from the believability of the game. Some people have actually suggested playing in French with English subtitles to make it more believable.Character Movement: I had a lot of trouble with the movement of the characters at certain parts of the game. I would push one way and the character might go another. Also, when the camera changed angles, you have to change the way you are directing the character. This became annoying after a while.1 challenge: There was 1 particular challenge, which I do not want to give away, but it took me completely out of the story and made me completely aware that I was playing a video game. It was very much like a normal video game. It seemed very out of place to me, and I thought it could of been done a lot better.In the end, I loved the game. The Pros completely outweighed the cons for me. I love the real life of the game, and the difference from all the other games out there. I am excited to see the difference between endings. I have only seen 3 of them so far, and from what I understand there are 22.
At first i thought that every horror game was the same, i thought after playing the resident evil saga that they'll go in the same direction, well, that changed when i played haunting grounds, well, that game made me see that i could be scared a lot with a game and that not every survival horror has to be the same. I then got this game, well, it's scary, not as much as haunting grounds, but the gameplay, game style is very different from anything that i have played before and this game is really good and scary enough to make you wait 'till the night to play it.The good thing is that you can play events in time, you play a piece of the game from the day before, then in the present, and then in the future, it's a pulp fiction like horror movie.It's a very good game, even if don't like the horror genre, the game stills makes you play it.I give this game five stars 'cause the game has great graphics, great sound and the game simply surprised me. When i paid nine bucks with free shipping, i thought, well, let's check it out, well, the game is a bargain, cheaper as any old game but good as any new game.I recommend this game 'cause i know it'll surprise you also.

I got this game because I was looking for one that would be equally fun when playing alone or with guests.  This game has fit the bill and then some.I will admit when I originally picked up this game I was skeptical of how fun it would be.  Described as a 'puzzle/action game' it looked a bit basic in terms of skill level and complexity.  I also worried that it would be something more enteraining for families with young children than twentysomethings.  Happily this game proved me wrong and not only have my boyfriend and I gone through almost all the game play available, his mother also loved it so much she got her own copy.There are many positives about the game.  The first is that it is addictively fun.  We have played it with many different crowds and have yet to find someone who doesn't enjoy the game.  Most are skeptical at first, but then addicted.  It is an especially good game for newbies to the Wii because the game play is very easy to master and intuitive.  Because of this less time is spent mastering the remote and more on enjoying the game.  It also takes full advantage of the movement and possibilities of the Wii remote so it feels very different than playing a game on another system.I also appreciated the variety of activities between a single game.  Even though they are all different adapations of Jenga like games they are different enough to keep me entertained for hours.  Each game felt different enough that even when I had made it through most of the levels the subsequent ones never felt repetitive or boring.  There is even an in-game editor so you can build levels on your own, leading to seemingly endless gameplay.Even though I can usually find some flaw with every video game I've purchased this was not the case with this game.  If anything, I'm wishing it came with more levels so I could play longer.Overall this is a great game that I would recommend whether you are into single or multiplayer gameplay.  It is a particularly good game if you are new to the Wii system and want something you can master and enjoy quickly.  It is easily up there withMario Kart Wii with Wii WheelandSuper Mario Galaxy.
Prepare yourself for this game. It's unbelievable. The graphics are the best I've EVER seen on any video game and the game stays extremely close to the story line of not only the Two Towers but incorporates part of the first movie as well.Its play is wonderful -- from the easy levels that prohibits frustration with new game players so that they're not killed off in two seconds into the game (thereby chucking the game across the room and never playing it again) -- to more challenging or expert levels for the advanced game player.It seems one of the great advantages of the XBOX is its processor and this game takes full advantage of that. Seamless movies interspersed with game play creates a game that is truly a story-telling adventure. You feel immediately immersed into the game and the &quot;interruptions&quot; of movie clips don't seem invasive.Get this game. Get this game. Oh boy, get this game.Then tell your friends and family you'll see them in a couple of weeks.

Great shooter. Online was a great engine but lacked players because MOH is not as popular as the other two titles.Single player was great, good story and fantastic graphics.

This sequel to the oddball hit Loco Roco falls in the categories of both "whimsical" and "eccentric".  It's not a puzzle game, but you need to solve puzzles.  It's not a twitch game, but from time to time, the way you twiddle the triggers is everything.  It's not ultra-realistic, and yet physics is an important part of gameplay.In Loco Roco 2, a world of cute creatures made from simple shapes has been overrun with some odd colorless creatures from another world.  They've corrupted the color with black blobs and it's up to you to put things right.  You play a cute little yellow blob that grows bigger as it finds things to eat.  Movement in Loco Roco 2 consists of using the shoulder buttons to tilt the world this way or that and make your blob hop up and down--and it comes down to timing the tiliting/sliding action with the hops to get the blob to go where you want it to.  Your cute little blob is made up of (and can break itself into) bunches of little blobs, and from time to time that is exactly how you have to get through parts of each level.  Levels vary enough to be interesting, with sliding on ice, bobbing on water, or slipping through pachinko-like tunnels in "little-blob" form enjoyable.Everything seems simplistic on the surface, but it can get fairly complicated if you're one of those people who wants to experience it all:  hidden areas, minigames, alternate side goals and more are embedded in the game.  You can replay levels, and the levels can "Level Up" which apparently makes it easier for you to find more goodies.  You also find other characters who become playable as you go along, with slight differences in how they behave.This colorful, simple-shape world is backed by a soundtrack reminiscent of Sesame Street:  it's very childlike and cheery.  While you're playing the game, it adds to the experience.  However, I've found that anyone *not* playing Loco Roco 2 who gets within earshot finds it annoying (and I can't imagine buying the soundtrack CD that's offered here and actively listening to it outside of the game).  Children will most likely enjoy this game, but smaller children who are just getting into gaming would probably have a hard time understanding some of what is expected of them:  they'd probably be more prone to tilting the PSP and expecting things to roll or slide than they would be able to figure out the shoulder-button mechanics.  I expect that the very small will enjoy watching big brother or sister (or mom or dad) while they play, as its Baby-Einstein graphics can make Loco Roco 2 almost hypnotic at times.If you like a bit of puzzling and don't mind a bit of arcade button-mashing, Loco Roco 2 will provide you a gaming experience that strays outside of the mainstream.  Its content is definitely safe for children, and makes a nice break from the typical, "you have bad guys, and you have to shoot/kill/explode/bop 'em on the head" gameplay mechanic that permeates many games.  Its eccentric style may not be for everyone, and its soundtrack may overrun your tolerance for sweetness, but I think it's just part of an excellently-crafted package.  I haven't found everything (or even completely beaten) Loco Roco 2 yet, but I definitely see myself getting there.
With all the games I play, there are few that are simple, delightful fun. Loco Roco definitely falls into this category. The game is easy to learn, has great replayability, and can really be enjoyed by all ages.Here's the basics. You begin as a yellow, happy blob. When you use the shoulder buttons, you tilt the world left or right, making the blob roll. You can also press both buttons so the blob springs into the air. As you eat certain flowers, the blob grows in size. If you hit an area too narrow for your big blob, you can break up into all of the mini-blobs, and later regroup.This may sound odd - but it is a TON of fun. The backgrounds are all works of art, with a wide variety of themes. You can be in an ice world and slide along on super-slick pathways. There are lots of hidden rooms and secret bonusses to search for. The little blobs are just so happy! They sing along with the music, enjoy the sliding around and celebrate at the end. It's really a game that you have a great deal of enjoyment at every step of the way.There are little mini-games, and you unlock "house pieces" that let you build your very own blob maze. By positioning the various house pieces, you can create an endless set of loops for your blobs to go around in.With all the games out there that have you swearing at your machine in frustration because of the inane controls or frustrating enemies, it is really a joy to find a game that is always fun. Even if you don't do well, it's fun, and it encourages you to try again to do better. You only get 10 of the little blobs to the end of the level? That's a great start - and give it another go to see if you can find even more! Between the catchy songs and the beautiful backgrounds, you really do want to leap into the fray again and explore every little angle.This is a great game for young kids, mature grandparents, and everyone in between. The gameplay is easy enough to learn, and fulfilling enough that you'll be addicted soon.Highly recommended.
Resistance was the first FPS that I purchased for the PS3 and it was a great way to start the generation. This game was an amazing ride that left me begging for more. The story is so well written, and the action complements it so well. The graphics are also pretty good. They are not amazing, but the grim green color of the game sort of hurts the graphics, but adds to the overall presentation of the game. The voice overs are spooky and mysterious. They really make you feel like you're a part of something bigger than yourself. This game also had great full campaign co op offline. This was a great touch that added the replayability to the title. This title should not be missed by anyone who loves the FPS genre; the sequel is a different story.Presentation- The menus and overall feel of the game is gloomy and gritty. This helps put the player into the fight as the human race fights to survive against the Chimera. They do however hurt the graphics; they should have been a bit brighter in places. The cut scenes are also well done as well as the music and sound effects. 4.5/5Graphics- As I said above the grittiness of the game hurt the overall feel of the graphics. They could have been better, but they did look good in cut scenes where the grittiness was not as prevalent. 4/5Story- The story is where Resistance really shines. The voice overs are an excellent way to narrate Hale's journey. The characters are woven into the campaign very seamlessly and you connect to each one. There is a great deal of mystery that adds to the fun of the campaign. Finding out what happened or will happen to Hale was a great adventure. 5/5Game Play- The use of different rings to hold your weapons is ingenious. I love to hold all of the weapons in the game, and harder difficulties give you more weapons. The only gripe I have is that the enemies seem to take a few too many hits. They should be dead after a few headshots. 4.5/5Lasting Appeal- This game is a treasure. The only sad part is that the sequel was so disappointing, that sort of hurt this game, and the franchise. I have beaten it five times. This game has a great replay value. I recommend this title however, I don't recommend the sequel. 5/5Overall 4.6/5
I simply love the character development and interaction. The story line is great- two friends are playing different characters and there is a surprising difference in the narrative for all three of us.Graphics  9.0Gameplay 9.5Story 10Replayability 7.5Sound 8.5Voice Over 9.5Customization 8.0Overall Fun 9.0The game is more controlled (more linear) than Oblivion but generally not as tedious. So much of the depth can be optionally played that the experience of playing the game twice can be quite different. Thank you Bioware and EA for releasing this terrific game. The sequel needs to have local multiplayer.  Next in line--"The Last Guardian"!!
great concept, great graphics, great sound, great gameplay, do you get it yet, this game is great!
great concept, great graphics, great sound, great gameplay, do you get it yet, this game is great!
Ok, I'll make this simple, this is a great game.  Alot of people are so spoiled with greatness, they forget how to actually have fun.  The graphics are great, the controls are fluid, there are great power up and levels, each boss battle is different and fun, the puzzle arent hard but a great change of pace, and the story is always good.  So the bottom line is people need to learn how to take all that technical stuff out of their reviews and just need to learn how to have fun again.  If you want to have fun, have a good story, with amazing graphics, this is the game for you.  This is my favorite game right now at this moment, I love it :-)
i received this game for my 60th birthday and i can't put it down. the graphics are great and the cars are so realistic. having great fun and would recommend it for anyone who likes to drive cars and race the bad guys, great, great fun.
Medal of honor is a great game, u cant stop playing it. u have to keep going on and on (believe me, i know). but what bugs me is that the company made the game to easy- u always have a compas on the top-left of the screen, so u always know where to go.- killing people is fun but it gets boring and easy since u usually kill them with a sniper because otherwise u get killed if u go straight ahead.- finally mission objectives are not that hard and u easlly get to the point. (no thinking, etc.)Despite the fact that the game is easy, the game has great graphics and weapons, so it doesnt get that boring, and u feel that u are living the game!alltogether this game is great! u can also try the hard level (since i only had a chance to play normal) and have a great time!  u definetlly will not be disapointed from this game

I bought this with the ambition into turning my PSP into not only a gaming device but a camera on top of being a MP3 player, Picture Viewer and Video playback..uh er?Anyways the camera isn't as good as my proper sole purpose camera but for the price of $20 + a game it was quite the deal.Im going to split this review into two, one for the camera and one for the game.PSP Camera:Quality - Above Average 7/10 has digital editing features such as sketch and distort etc.., its kinda grainy at times, but when the focus kicks in, it actually looks pretty fair, the imagine quality could be something compared to a cheap camera for a PC, meaning its okay but not the best out there. it is above average though that is for sure.Design - Slick 9/10 not bulky or ugly at all, Sony did well with this one.Features - Solid 9/10 it can easily replace your average ordinary digital camera if you have a big enough memory stick, I.E 2,4,6,8,10,12,14, or 16GB, though even 2-4GB should be more then enough space to get some decent photos and videos out of.Sound (VIDEO MODE ONLY) Good - 7.5/10 Sounds a bit to soft to me, however that can easily be edited later on when transfering over to a PC, Laptop, or PS3. its good, not bad or great, just good.Extras - Surprisingly Okay 9/10 It has its own menu mode, like Picture, Video and Music Modes with a good amount of editing and tweaking features, it could have used more, but i wasn't expecting some of these added options, i was only expecting basic options at best, these were above basic for sure. However its lacking Hi-Res options such as 1080 x 720 or above, the highest res is has is 680 x something, which isn't bad but not good, though its a gaming device first, which i understand, and a secondary device last, so for what it is, its good.Overall - Ultimately... 9.2/10 This bundle alone is worth it for the camera, since my local gamestop, wal-mart etc.. seem to be selling them solo for a high price $50 or higher for the camera alone, and online its worth up to $400 for the camera! that's insane, im glad i found it bundled here and with a game no less.[___________________________InVizamals Game:Plot - Pokemon...in Real life? 7/10 That's pretty much it in a not shell, it sounds stupid at first, nor did i care about it when ordering it since my main ambition was to get the camera, however the game isn't bad at all, infact it surprised me and reminds me somewhat of the good ol' pokemon days, however it has elements that make it completely original on its own, for example, i've never played a pokemon game where... there running around in your house as aura-energied freaks!For what it is, it does it good, Point your camera at certain colors, like Red, Blue, Purple, Green, Yellow and so on and you get to face a new freaky thing or whatever lol, its funny if anything.Gameplay - Basic but mildly entertaining... 7.5/10 It's basic Japanese Old School RPG goodness, i no longer care for this type of gameplay, however it was entertaining non-the-less, besides it offers new innovative elements like capturing creatures in im assuming over 100 ways, that is impressive, i don't care what anyone says, thats alot of animation.Graphics - Pretty good actually! 7.5/10 this looks on par with some current PC games and even quite alot of Wii games, im actually shocked at how well the creatures textures are for a PSP game, i guess it must have something to do with no rendering of the backround, since the backround is being rendered by.. reality is self! Oooooooooohh!Sound - Good music, funny acting. 9/10 you can tell this games target audience is between the ages of 5 years old to maybe 12 years old. it's very child friendly, and unlike most games where the characters are rendered with the games engine, they have actual actors in this game, so far i've come across, 1 pretty boy japanese geek dude, 1 japanese troll gamer who lives with his mom, 1 old british dude who acts like that one guy from the first Jurassic park, 1 indian girl, and some trolls in suits, i haven't gotten far into the story yet, but i find it to be extremely funny and will continue it if only for the horrible acting.The music is also very good to, very relaxing and surreal for some reason in some tracks. theres also some epic Choir music going on in here that can rival the Final Fantasy or World of Warcraft series.. what the heck right?Replay Value - Depends really... 7/10 it would depend on the person, im 20 years old and i find this 12 year olds game to be somewhat amusing, if only for the innovative design it has. i know for sure my cousins, sisters, and little bother would fall in love with this kinda game though, its hip and new and would drive them crazy so if your a big brother or sister / Mom or Dad, get this game for them (With the camera if you can, otherwise good luck trying to get the ridiculously priced PSP cameras elsewhere at a price below $50) because chances are it'll keep kids occupied for hours and hours, because you can even interact with the animals you catch, whats most awesome them virtual pets you don't have to feed or clean after! oh and you can smack around other animals to!Overall - 7.9 This is impressive to me, i was expecting a total garbage game, but now this truly was a bonus to the Camera. This is proof sony can be innovative to, just like with Folklore for the PS3 and its amazing Sixaxis control, and Flower for PS3 as well, this doesn't rank as high as those games, but boy does it rank high up there.

Oooooooooohh!Sound - Good music, funny acting. 9/10 you can tell this games target audience is between the ages of 5 years old to maybe 12 years old. it's very child friendly, and unlike most games where the characters are rendered with the games engine, they have actual actors in this game, so far i've come across, 1 pretty boy japanese geek dude, 1 japanese troll gamer who lives with his mom, 1 old british dude who acts like that one guy from the first Jurassic park, 1 indian girl, and some trolls in suits, i haven't gotten far into the story yet, but i find it to be extremely funny and will continue it if only for the horrible acting.The music is also very good to, very relaxing and surreal for some reason in some tracks. theres also some epic Choir music going on in here that can rival the Final Fantasy or World of Warcraft series.. what the heck right?Replay Value - Depends really... 7/10 it would depend on the person, im 20 years old and i find this 12 year olds game to be somewhat amusing, if only for the innovative design it has. i know for sure my cousins, sisters, and little bother would fall in love with this kinda game though, its hip and new and would drive them crazy so if your a big brother or sister / Mom or Dad, get this game for them (With the camera if you can, otherwise good luck trying to get the ridiculously priced PSP cameras elsewhere at a price below $50) because chances are it'll keep kids occupied for hours and hours, because you can even interact with the animals you catch, whats most awesome them virtual pets you don't have to feed or clean after! oh and you can smack around other animals to!Overall - 7.9 This is impressive to me, i was expecting a total garbage game, but now this truly was a bonus to the Camera. This is proof sony can be innovative to, just like with Folklore for the PS3 and its amazing Sixaxis control, and Flower for PS3 as well, this doesn't rank as high as those games, but boy does it rank high up there.
I am the biggest hardcore player on SOCOM II. Online as of May 32st 2005, I have about 6100 Kills and 3500 Deaths. I am not just a hardcore fan, I am also pretty good. Now, there are many many things in this game to go over, and I couldn't possibly do it all. First off, do not bother getting this game to try the offline expierience.. it's well not worth it. With that out of the way, let me get down with the online play. Here are the POPULAR levels, my ratings, and how they stack up to me.( I most likely will not remember them all.. sorry. :( )OLD LEVELS:Frostfire: 10/10 : This level takes place on a very large ship, and it's at night time, but it is not that dark. The main thing I love about this map is how it is all flat, allowing for quick kills, and a lot of fun. A main feature about this level though is probably the tunnels, in where the Terrorists normally ' Camp ' from the SEALs with a shotgun and wait for them to come down. This level is different from the old version simply because the tunnels are connected. This is BYFAR my favorite map of SOCOM and SOCOM II. It is also one of the most popular SOCOM II maps. ( Most likely #3 ) Advantage: Most Likely TerroristsDESERT GLORY: 9/10: In this level, the SEALs must extract the hostages from their cells while the terrorists try and protect them. The title of the level is basically what the level is like. A very desolent level with a lot of sand and run down buildings. There are buildings to camp out in, stuff to hide behind, and it's just a great. This is also a very popular online map. ( Most likely #2 )Advantage: Probably TerroristsNIGHT STAKLER: 6/10: To many people, this reminds them of DESERT GLORY at night. But to me, I see it as a much different level. Though similar in design, this one is in mid-night ( so its not too dark ) and instead of extracting hostages, you have to plant a bomb. This level is similar to DESERT GLORY in some ways, but this level is bigger ( i think ) and not as fun. ( there are too many sniper positions.. it's almsost impossible to hide from them! ) This map, AS WELL is also a rather popular online map. ( Probably about #6 ) Advantage: Possibly the SEALsNEW LEVELS:CROSS ROADS: 8/10: This is the first level I played for SOCOM II online. This is litterally ALWAYS full of people in the public rooms, and is very, very popular. This level has the SEALs starting at one corner and the Terrorists starting at the other. You have to find the bomb and plant it at the opposing base. This level reminds me of a fancy middle-east market place for some reason. This level is pretty average to me, thogh. This one like i said is EXTREMELY popular. ( Definitely #1 ) Advantage: None, in ' Clan Wars ' this is normally the tie-breaker.There is many more maps, but those are just a few. I will now goto the guns ( I will try to list them all )SEALS:M4A1: 10/10: Great gun. Shoots fast, accurateM4A1SD: 10/10: Great gun. Shoots accurately, good for headshots, silencedRA-14: 9/10: Not bad of a gun. Accurate, takes off heavy damage.IW-80 A2: 10/10: Should be used by ' noobies ' very good accuracy, very good shooting, but considered a ' ***** gun 'AK-105: 8/10: Not too bad. Similar to the RA-14 but shoots slower.HK5: 6/10: Only good if you are good at getting headshots.HK5SD: 7/10: Only good for getting headshots, accurate.HK5K: 7/10: Horrible accuracy, but fast shooting, so almost a guarenteed kill.12 GAUGE PUMP: 4/10: Useless unless in tunnels on Frostfire!TERRORISTS:AK-47: 6/10: Not very good. Bad accuracy, not very good overall.AKS-74: 6/10: Similar to the AK-47.STG-77: 8/10: Similar to the SEALs HK5K , to me. Good for headshots.552: 6/10: Seems useless compared to SOCOM 1. Very weak.552SD: 6/10: More useless than 552; very weak, but silenced.9mm SUB: 7/10: Similar to the SEALs HK5K, good for headshots.TA 12 GAUGE: 6/10: Dont bother. Use the M3M3 12 GAUGE: 9/10: Automatic, Awesomely deadly, horrible on long range.NEUTRAL GUNS ( used on both sides )M16A2: 9/10: Only gun in the game that shoots on burst, similar to IW except harder to use, must tap trigger, deadly accurate.M14: 10/10: Unbelievebly powerful. Only 20 bullets. Accurate. Considered a ' noobie ' gun by some people.M60E3: 7/10: Considered a ' noobie cannon ', a lot of bullets, bad accuracy, good for killing someone during their reload time.M63A: 7/10: Considered a ' noobie cannon ', a lot of bullets, bad accuracy, good for killing someone durring their reload time.Now, this is how many bullets each gun has per clip.M4A1,M4A1SD,RA-14,IW-80 A2,AK-105, HK5, HK5K, HK5SD, AK-47, AKS-74, STG-77, 552, 552SD, M16A2: ALL HAVE 30 BULLETS9mm SUB: 60 BULLETSM14: 20 BULLETSM63A: 60 or 65 BULLETS ( sorry, i'm not sure )M60E3: 100 BULLETS12 GAUGE PUMP: 8 BULLETSM3 12 GAUGE: 12 BULLETS ( I think. )TA 12 GAUGE: 12 BULLETS ( I think. )Well, I did not include PISTOLS or SNIPERS in there, but i will now.For SEALs, use the MARK 23, MARK 23 SD, or SP-10 for a pistol, and a M87ELR for a sniper.For Terrorists, use the DE.50 or MAYBE the Model 18 ( the only automatic gun in the game ) for a pistol, and the M82A1A for a sniper.That is finally the END of my LOOOONG SOCOM2 review, and I hoped it helped you out.

That game is ereally cool. The graphics are amazing, and the textures may be a little cheesy for the skins on their face (or on Malprave's bouncing b...), but they are really nice 10/10 for that.The voice acting is excellent, with R being a old reminder of the old Q, the nice old man who gave Bond stuff to (hurt) people with.10/10 for that too. The music and sound effects are a little underrated, compared to the voice casting. 8/10 for those.The controls, as usual with a Bond game, are really tight. They are easy to access, althought using the cross pad for weapons and gadgets is a little flaw. 9/10 The story, is as with any Bond game true to its cause, good, but you will find the same old formula:1.people die.2.You go in for info.3.You meet the bad girl4.You meet the good girl (from whom you are probably gettign nooky from at the end.)5.You save the world, and get the girl. (nooky!)Same old same old. 7/10The single player is good, but the only thing that saves this game from ahaving a zero replay value is the multiplayer, which will make you play with your friends, and replay the single player so you can get the awards for it. Gameplay: 9 Replay value: 6Last thing: the booklet. A game's quality is often partly relected by its instruction booklet. In this game he booklet is good, and cmpprhensive, although a little bit of color would havebeen nice, and some input about how to get the awards. 8/10Overall, this is not an average: 8/10 (4/5 stars.)I'm still waiting for Nightfire.

We all know the 2 kinds of football games. Theres NFL Blitz where players fly across the field, beat [each other up], and the football is the size of there heads, then theres Madden. The great thing about madden is that it's simply realistic. Real physics, real penaltys, a player can get injured. Plus, get this, you can challenge calls. I have never used this option before. It's great!What makes Madden unbeleivble is it's awesome "Instant Replay" option. You can see the entire field, with the abilility to move, turn and zoom freely. You can choose EAsy mode (Get it, EAsy for EA sports. Heh, heh) and Normal. Also you may select Madden Cards (Which is cool feature) or training. During the game you can get points for completing certain goals (i.e, making a 30 yard pass, intercepting, sacking the QB making 3 tackels with one player, a 30 yard field goal, etc) Not to forget the ability to turn penalties on, or decrease there size. With a create-a-team option or God-like players (On the Ecko team) Gameplay gets 10/10.The graphics don't get much better. With details on every player, coach and referee, it's amazing. Instant Replay's aren't grainy or choppy, they look perfect. There is absolutly nothing wrong with the graphics. It gets a perfect 10/10.Because it's EA you know that the commentary will be great. John Madden cracks me up with his little sayings he quotes. Not to mention you can hear the announcer say funny phrases. Such as, once, I cleary heard him say "Would the owner of a blue jeep cherokee, liscene 767-EXE please report to the parking lot? You're vehicle is on fire." What's wrong with it? Well, either i'm havinh Deja Vu, or the people say the same things maybe 3 times per game. After a while it gets boring because the don't say new things. With a small subtraction because of repetition, the sound receives a 8/10.Speed? Well, let me just say I wasn't happy. Unlike other Gamecube games, which load within 5 or 10 seconds, Madden takes 30-35 seconds. It's worth it in the end though! Unfortunatly, I have to nail the speed by giving it a harsh 7/10.Controls are amazing. It just makes perfect sense! When the ball is snapped, you will see an A,B,X,R or L over certain players heads. (During Normal mode you must press "A" first) Just press the corresponding button and the QB will pass. X is spin. Y is jump. C-stick in stiff arms. B is dive. It just makes perfect sense. A 10/10 is definitly fair for this element.Replay ... well DUH! I'm not going to buy a Football game and play it once. I think all sports game need to have a 10/10 for replay or they just aren't worth buying. So, of course, Madden 2002 gets a 10/10As you can see, if you're going to get a Football game, get Madden. Let's review:Gameplay: 10/10Graphics: 10/10Sound: 8/10Speed: 7/10Controls: 10/10Replay value: 10/10Total: 55/60 giving Madden 2002 a 91.67CheatsThere are no real cheats. Some Easter Eggs, like special Holiday Commentary, and a few cheats, like maximum player stat points, add to the game. I'll give it a +2Madden 2002's new score is a 93.67

Portable gaming is a dicey proposition for me. I don't want something too terribly complicated, because time is a factor and controls are usually subpar compared to a full sized console controller. I want something quick and light, but that I can keep coming back to.Well, PJM:Deluxe is all this and more. You get all the content of the PSN game, plus new levels, as well as a few new tower types, in a nice portable package. Your average level will take 5-15 minutes to complete, and you can always pause the PSP and do a "soft" power off, which will keep the game ready to come back to.I would estimate that, without a desire to really maximize (AKA Rainbow) your scores, you would need a good ten hours to complete the game. There are loads of levels, spanning both islands from the PSN game, as well as a new tropical island for this iteration. There is also a "Randomizing" island that shuffles locations and enemies. While it's not a full bodied level editor (maybe for PJM2?), it extends the life of the game a bit.The graphics are bright and clear, and the analog nub works fine for movement. The game's controls are simple enough to translate well to PSP.In sum, you really can't spend your portable gaming money better than this. You get at least a dozen hours of gameplay, with the potential for much more if you become a perfectionist or an addict, both of which are likely propositions with this game.

Well after I gave poor reviews to Everquest, Everquest II I am giving high reviews to! My hat goes off to sony for making an amazing game. Everquest II is the paragon of fantasy games. Almost all my quibbles I had about Everquest are fixed with Everquest II. I played Everquest for a while and got bored and fustrated that the fun didn't really begin until I became a higher level character. Also solo play and death in Everquest was not fun. It seemed unsurmountable to solo a character past level 20. Well sony listened to players carping criticism and made a better game with Everquest II.Improvements:1) The death system is more congenial in everquest II. You don't loose your body, you don't loose experience, levels, the only attribute that is affected in death is wisdom, you can still equip all your items after death.2) In my opinion graphics transcend any game to date including Doom 3! Surreal graphics, character detail is immaculate, lighting and reflection affects are resplendent. This game is a pearl! My paladin's pulchritude left me stunned. Those incredulous graphics come at a cost though, it requires a goliath of a system to play this game well. My desktop is rigged with a 3ghz processor, 768 megabytes of ram, a 10,000 rpm hard disk - RAID configured, and a Geforce 6600 GT with 128 megs of VRAM and my computer is still not effacacious enough for this game. The ultra high graphic settings in Everquest II can freeze my computer with ease. So I can only image how eye-popping this game can be! The game recommends to play the game at ultra high (maxed out) video system you should have a video card with 512 megabytes of VRAM, YIKES !!! For now I can only play it at a resolution of 1024 x 1280 pixels on a High Quality setting.3) No kill/loot stealing ! This is a treasure trove. I wallow this in everquest II once you attack a monster that monster is locked with you. A little lock appears at the top indicating to other players that kill is all yours and other players cannot barge in and kill the monster ( steal your kill and your experience and loot from that monster). This was an unsurmountable problem in Everquest that vexed me as a player, because some players  were inconsiderate and plundered my experience points and spoils! This is probally one of the biggest reasons why I prefer this game over World of Warcraft, in World of Wacraft no such system like this is in place other players can pillage your earned loot without reprimand. I speak from my own personal experience.4) I wallow in the monolithic labyrinth of timorous passageways and chambers found in the dungeons in Everquest II !! What an improvement the dungeons are from it's predecessor. The dungeons were not all that arousing to me in Everquest, except for mistmore and kurnst. And what is nice about it is a wide range of characters from many different levels can savor these dungeons. I fell in love with Stromhold ! Given my druthers, this is my favorite dungeon. I can still gain experience from this dungeon even at level 27.  The level range of the monsters in this dungeon are from 15 - 25. I have seen characters as low as level 13 and as high as level 30 adventuring through this dungeon. This is a dungeon you can revist over and over again as you level up and pioneer into unfathomable depths. This dungeon doesn't look like a hundred other dungeons, it is a novelty and has its own look. Graphically one of the most jaw dropping zones.5) Even green players can venture through entrancing dungeons and caves. This wasn't true with everquest before the expansions. The origonal everquest was unfriendly to new players, it was only until later after the expansions that they added oddments of new zones and features for the inexperienced characters. YOu can participate in a raid at only level 23 in this game ! In everquest Raids were origonally only reseved for high level characters.6) Equiptment and spells were basic and only a small farrago of items to choose from. The crafting system in Everquest was elemtary and crude. Everquest II is a stark contrast, a conglomeration of hundreds of arms and incantations to pick from. An motley of mythical, legendary, fabled and treasured loot.  Crafting is unparralled in Evequest II. Players can become apt in their chosen craft in little time. Better crafting systems create a more robust economy. The economy in this sequel is so volatile it is surreal ! Spells can be upgraded from other players that specialize in scribing scrolls. All my items I wear are handcrafted by other players. There is just something special about being able to wear items other players tailored specifically for your needs !7) Solo adventuring is actually an option in this sequel. Cresting to that elusive level 60 can be concievably be done alone in this game without any other players help. I enjoyed the fast clip I could level up while playing solo in this game, this was a pampering change compared to its predecessor. This sate my appetite for an online game that had an oustanding single player experience. Leveling up is a lot faster in EQ II also because you never loose experience or levels ! You don't have to worry about recovering a body in order to level up, example in everquest whenever I died I couldn't kill anything or level at all period because all my stuff was gone left on my body somewhere !8) The principal cities in Everquest II, Queynos and Freeport, sate my fantasy reveries. Queynos I found a serene solace where my character would retreat to ease the days tensions. The king arthur atmosphere of the city made me feel as if I was repute and wore a laurel over my head. I had a profound feeling of chivalry and swagger.  Freeport was a becon for vile irreverence and servitude. NPC's were contempt and shallow in this city. The city's sky was marred by the gloom of the precipice turrets and pallisades.cons:1) I think the general opinion that the party system is flawed in Everquest II is a cogent argument. Although I am sure Sony carefully crafted the new party system, anyone who has played the game can't deny the inherent shortcomings. The party system in other games ,like for example World of Warcraft, does not bludgeon the players when they make a fatal mistake. I do not like groups sharing experience debt. This can make playing in groups an irremediable calamity. Players do not like losing expeirence and if I was the cause most players wouldn't hesitate to chafe me with a pompous lecture. Other players would get infuriated and berate me if I died, one group booted me out of the group when I died. I quickly learned some players are pious and haughty about this game. This game overall is quant and pleasing even with its flaws.

I'm not sure what I expected to get out of &quot;EverQuest,&quot; having heard some opinions from people who are much more hardcore gamers than I am, but here's what I got out of it:&quot;EverQuest&quot; is not a regular computer game. You don't pop it into your computer, go whack a certain number monsters on the head, win, and then deinstall it. Those games are a lot of fun, but once you've, say, killed Diablo several times with different character types in &quot;Diablo II,&quot; you're not exactly rushing to do it the 300th time. Not by any means. (Great game, &quot;Diablo II,&quot; but a different sort of animal altogether.) Those that see &quot;EverQuest&quot; as a big online &quot;Quake&quot; game seem to get very frustrated with many aspects of the game, including other players, and the feeling is usually mutual.That's because, instead of &quot;Diablo,&quot; &quot;EverQuest&quot; is more akin to a huge themed chat room interwoven with a game. Sure, you can and do play by yourself sometime, but you have to hunt far and wide across the game world of Norrath to find a place where you won't be interacting with someone else. (For the record, you can find it: Go to the Tox Forest south of Erudin, and swim west from the docks. The Kerra Isle zone is almost always empty, and it's especially so inside, if you choose not to hunt the native cat people, but instead do the quests for them. The quiet is a nice change from the sometimes deafening roar that pervades most EQ zones.)In fact, the game is designed to more or less force you to work with other players: After getting your character (selected from either sex, multiple fantasy races and about as many fantasy hero/villain careers) up a few levels whacking the more mundane monsters and animals, you pretty quickly run into a wall where it becomes much harder to go at it alone. Jack may have been a giant-killer in the fairy tale, but if you want to kill giants in EQ, you're going to need friends. And that's what makes EQ a killer app: Interaction. You may think you aren't interested in making a bunch of online friends, but you'll soon find yourself laughing with, cursing with and adventuring with strangers from around the globe. I have no idea who some of the people I play with are beyond the vaguest details, but it doesn't matter. I get to jump into this fantasy world and I've got brave friends who have my back as I have theirs, ready and waiting.Hardcore gamers, as I alluded to earlier, will quibble about some of EQ's technical specifications. First off, I've had very few technical problems. I can almost always connect within 30 seconds, have been kicked off line only twice in over six weeks of play, and the dreaded &quot;lag&quot; where the game continues by the connection between server and home computer can't keep up, has rarely been a problem. It occurs, but it's not very problematic, and even the harshest EQ critics acknowledge that it's getting better all the time.There's also some talk that the graphics, especially in the original section of EQ (the continents of Antonica and Faydwer, and the island of Odus) aren't up to par, but I don't get the argument. Setting the game at maximum resolution (because I've got a late model computer), the graphics are gorgeous, and I haven't even explored the prettier (and more graphics-intensive) continent of Kunark yet.For fantasy fans, EQ strikes a good balance between the familiar and the new. Many players want to play traditional elves and dwarves, and those areas of Faydwer are packed to the gills (particularly the elvish areas of the Faydark forest). You can help a sickly unicorn, slay dragons, play as a hobbit-like halfling and battle fierce orcs. Or, if you need another Tolkein-inspired fantasy game like you need a hole in the head, you can be an Erudite magician from far-off Odus (EQ has included a fantasy race of color, the Erudites, with a lightly African-themed look to them, and has made them the preeminent masters of all sorts of magic, good and evil, in the world of Norrath), exploring the deadly continent of Kunark and battling the native lizard peoples, the Iksar, there. (The Iksar are also a playable race, for those looking for an extremely distinctive character type.)There's more to this game than can be covered in this review -- characters can develop skills beyond the ability to kill each other; my gnome wizard is an accomplished linguist, for instance, meaning that I've had to sit down with more than a dozen player-controlled characters of non-gnomish descent and share language lessons -- as EQ is a rich, deep, surprisingly immersive game.Everything they say is true: EQ is addictive. And there's lots of good reasons why. A terrific game, and my household has two copies, one for me, and one for my wife.

I first got in to Ultima thanks to my dad buying Ultima III: Exodus for a then-newly bought Atari 800XL back in 1985. Remembering this was the 1980s, I got hooked on the game rather quickly, and in 1986, I was able get Ultima IV for the same computer and found it even more challenging. After that, I wasn't able to get any more Ultimas, mainly bacause Ultima IV was the final Ultima made available on the Atari 8-bit, and I never was able to get the first two. Far more recently (in 2004)bought the Ultima Collection CD package and I am not one bit disappointed. It's nice they included a player reference card for all the games included, so you know the commands, how to read runes, answers to questions someone might ask you on Ultima VI, VII: The Black Gate and VII: Serpent Isle, and other important tips. My complaint is they forgot to mention the abilities (like strength, dexterity, intelligence, wisdom, etc.) of the humans, fuzzies, elvies, dwarves, etc. on Ultima III like the original packaging did. They also included an Ultima atlas for all eight of the Ultimas, although Ultima II would be easiest to find things since it was set right here on Earth. There is one drawback, and that Ultima III and IV both lack music on this version (III had music for the Atari 8-bit, IV didn't, although music was featured on the Commodore C-64 version). Ultima III, if you were lucky to own the Atari 400/800/XL/XE or the Commodore 64, was the very first Ultima to introduce music, so it's a bit strange to not hear music when you play this PC collection. For those raised on PC games of the 1990s and 2000s, many will be turned off by the crude graphics. Ultima II and III particularly show their age (Ultima I included here is not the original from 1980, but the 1986 remake from Origin in which the graphics were updated to Ultima IV standards). But if you grown up in the 1980s, like myself, the graphics will come as no surprise. Ultima I and II don't take very long to win. In fact on Ultima II, it isn't even necessary to explore dungeons or towers to win, or even visit every planet (although it's nice to, because there are more towns and castles to explore, but there is one planet that is a must to visit in order to win). Dungeons on Ultima I, however, are crucial to winning the game, especially if a king from a certain castle tells you to kill a certain creature (like a liche, balron, gelatinous cube, etc.). Ultima III was the first to include a multi-player party system (up to four players), plus a maximum hit point system (where you need to go to a healer to heal), and a separate battle scene. Ultima IV featured better graphics because you don't get cyan and magenta vegetation and water, and this was the very first Ultima you don't kill an evil ruler (like Mondain, Minax, or Exodus) to win. Ultima V-VII continue to use the same Britannia, with each of the series becoming more realistic (V introducing the day and night cycle, for example, and VI and onward featuring more 16-bit Super NES style graphics). Ultima VIII had been the most reviled of the series, many named it &quot;Super Avatar Brothers&quot; because of needing to hop over platforms to go places. To me, the game isn't bad and the graphics are stunning, for 1994 standards. Ultima VIII was the first Ultima since II to feature only a single player. There are drawbacks to this collection. You must run any Ultima after VI through MS-DOS. Mo-Slo, which is luckily included, is needed for all the Ultimas except VIII, and depending on your system, even Mo-Slo won't work right, as it might end up being a bit choppy. Ultima II works best if you download a program to make it more Windows-friendly. Akalabeth, the 1979 precursor to Ultima is also included in this package. Luckily they made this program PC and Windows friendly, no need for Mo-Slo here. Basically Akalabeth is only a historical curiosity, there don't seem to be much here except go in dungeons and kill monsters, particularly the ones Lord British tells you to kill. Anyway, despite a few drawbacks, and if you're feeling a bit nostalgic for your childhood days of playing Ultima, or if you're an Ultima fan with a curiosity about the game's history, this is the collection to get.

Note: This review is ONLY about the &quot;Scars of Velious&quot; add-on to Everquest, and not the game itself.&quot;Scars of Velious&quot; (referred to as SoV or simply &quot;Velious&quot;) is an Everquest expansion for levels 27-65. Unlike other expansions, it does not introduce a new race, a new class, raise the level cap or introduce a lot of special new abilities (although it does introduce a few for melees). Instead, its focus was on content.Specifically, it covers the frozen lost continent of Velious, home to a race of shipwrecked dwarves from Faydwer (in the original Everquest), trying to survive when faced by hostile giants and ancient dragons. The struggle between these three forces defines the expansion -- if you spend more than an hour here, you're more or less forced to choose sides, and who you fight determines how the other sides view you, which in turn closes off some content and opens up other content, as you become part of the battle for the future of this continent.The epitome of this struggle are two parallel quests for melees and spellcasters given out by the Coldain dwarves. Each is a multistage quest, and involves you proving your loyalty to the Coldain in their war against the giants. At first, the tasks they assign you are mundane -- deliver this axe to be sharpened, keep my nephew the &quot;great hunter&quot; out of trouble, go deliver some food to the captain of the guard -- but they culminate in skirmishes and even a full fledged war that totally redoes one zone for several hours in a pitched battle (lead by the players) between the giants and dwarves.Even for players not interested in this content (the ring war in the Great Divide is a high level raid), the expansion offers the best dungeons in EverQuest, amazing new cities, two new planes, high level spells, and a greater concentration of dragons than any other expansion in the game.While much of EverQuest can, at times, feel like a fantasy version of Quake, Velious lives up to the promise of an online roleplaying game that immerses players in another place and time. Featuring landscapes so chilly, you find yourself putting on a sweater, terrifying enemies, and great acts of heroism, &quot;Scars of Velious&quot; is the peak of the EverQuest experience.This expansion receives my strongest possible recommendation to all EverQuest players with characters level 27 and up.
Note: This review is ONLY about the &quot;Scars of Velious&quot; add-on to Everquest, and not the game itself.&quot;Scars of Velious&quot; (referred to as SoV or simply &quot;Velious&quot;) is an Everquest expansion for levels 27-65. Unlike other expansions, it does not introduce a new race, a new class, raise the level cap or introduce a lot of special new abilities (although it does introduce a few for melees). Instead, its focus was on content.Specifically, it covers the frozen lost continent of Velious, home to a race of shipwrecked dwarves from Faydwer (in the original Everquest), trying to survive when faced by hostile giants and ancient dragons.

I avoided this game for years simply because I heard a lot of bad reviews about it. Online Critics gave poor ratings. Many players complained about the player killing and the lag. My cousin always raved about this game, but I never tried it because it was $10.00 a month to play. Now that many games now charge a monthly fee to play I decided to try it. I feel like I was lied to. This game is one of the best games I have ever played, I can't understand how this game recieved such bad reviews. The depth in this game is unmatched. Many games copied Ultima Onlines skills and concept. Ultima Online is very underated. I can't believe games like Everquest and Diablo II get better ratings from online critics. What are these critics thinking! Everquest and Diablo II have great graphics, but the gameplay is very boring in those games and lacks very much depth. I use a dialup connection and the lag was not all that bad. On weekends and during busy hours the lag is bad, but overall it is not that bad. Lag in Diablo II was much worse I thought. The siege perilous shard and the Great Lakes shard were the funnest to play I thought. The siege perilous is the best shard to play on if you like PvP. Gameplay is close on that shard to what Ultima Online origonally was. I had a lot of fun on siege. The theif profession is very fun to play on that shard. No other game out can match the PvP experience Siege Perilous offers in my opinion. If you like crowds and like to see busy cities the Great Lakes server is the best server to play on I think. Britiana really feels like a city. During primetime there must be about a hundred players all hurdled around the bank trading. I thought before Diablo II had a great trading system, now I relize Ultima Online's is by far superior. The economy in this game I think is unmatched. Even though this game has less people playing than Everquest, I encountered a lot more people during gameplay than any other online game. The crafting is unmatched. People say DaoC is superior, I tried DaoC I think its overated. DaoC seemed too adventure oriented. The large problem with player killing has been fixed. Players that don't like pk's, can play on the Trammel Facet that is PvM oriented rather than PvP. The Mage I think is funner to play on Ultima Online verses many other games. Combat has a lot more to it in Ultima Online. Mage's chant spell words before they cast a spell and they have to use regents for each spell. Not all spells use the same regents. Cities really feel like cities in UO. They just seem to blend in more with the outside world, Everquest's cities feel like they are seperated from the rest of the world. I remeber one Online Critic gave Diablo II a 9/10 and Ultima Online a 6/10. I still puzzle over why this was. Diablo I &amp; II player killing was just as bad. The mounts in this game are unmatched. Players can ride a wide assortment of animals. Ranging from deer - to dragons!

I never got to play these games back on PSP because, well...I never owned one, but I had heard good things about both.  I was excited when they put them on a Playstation 3 collection, so I could finally play them, because I am a pretty big fan of the God of War franchise.  I have played the Ps2/Ps3 titles and loved them as well! Each of these 2 games is fairly short, maybe around 5 hours each, but combined this collection is totally worthwhile!  If you're a God of War fan or epic action/adventure fan and, like me, have never played these...I highly recommend checking them out!  Ghost of Sparta is the best of the 2, but both games are pretty awesome!  Looking forward to God of War 4 in September of 2012!  XD
I really liked this game.  I was bright and colorful but not too childish.  I liked the fact that the point of the game was to retrieve parts of the world and reconstruct it with clues from the inhabitants.  The weapon ungrade options were inovative and highly creative.  I liked that you could switch between the characters, all of which have different abilities and weapons.  Then, there is the fishing.  I like that you can take time out to fish and win point that can be exchanged for gems and attribute stones.  I played this game for DAYS on end.  The monsters got a little repetative, and the maps were all the same, but I still found this game highly enjoyable.

I have long had Command & Conquer Generals and Zero Hour, and I had C&C; 64 (N64) long ago. I've been wanting to get the Red Alert games and the rest of the C&C; franchise, and this collection is perfect. The games are fun and take me back to the 'good old days'. There are of course problems. I'm running windows 7 and many of these games run poorly, or not at all, on that OS, but that isn't the games' fault. That is all down to Microsoft not making their products backwards compatible (an annoyance we really shouldn't have to deal with, should we?). I'm reviewing the games and the collection as a whole, so I have to give it high marks. I love RTS (even though I'm not so good at them--I am too slow and steady for the fast pace)and these games represent years and years of them. It is like looking at that display in a museum where they show the evolution of Humans from hairy ape-like creatures to beings who can enjoy a good video game, except with more explosions.All-in-all, these games are fun and there are a lot in this collection. Isn't fun what gaming is about? I dunno when it became about cutting edge graphics and genre simplification (integration? sublimation? retardation?), but I know what is killing the gaming industry. The best games I've ever played all have horrible graphics (cause they'er all old). The Command & Conquer games remind you why you play games in the first place.
I had bought this collection three times , one for me, one for my cousin and one for my neightbor. This is just because we all enjoy and love to play the best of the best strategy games!!! The price is a super big deal worth your money 10 times of what it cost. You must get this collection or now the 10 years pack collection (that include the Generals ones), you will love me and love this games and love yourself and love the desicion you had made of buying this collection.

I've played many games and Undying is still in my top 5. I've played through about 6 times since 2002 and could say that I will again. While more modern games may have more advanced graphics (Undying's are very good), they do not rival the story and interesting gameplay Undying offers.The entire premise is captivating and unfolds neatly. There are a great variety of environments and monsters throughout so it never gets boring. The controls and two handed spells/weapons are very unique and I haven't seen another like it.Many games focus on graphics or stick close to a genre. Undying put a unique spin on the FPS and is simply one of the most memorable games I've ever played. To put it into perspective, my top 5 games are: Half Life 1, Resident Evil 4, Far Cry, MOH Allied Assault and Undying. These are the 5 games I would take on a desert island. Along with Salma Hayek.

I rented this game also for a week! And let me tell you something, it rocks! this game is the best. It wipes the ssx snowboarding games off the cliff and into the ice. i actually thought that this game will not be as realistic as watching it on tv or playing the actual sport, but as soon as i played it, i enjoyed it better than the ssx game. And besides, the ssx game is not realistic at all. But this one is the most realistic of all time! i actually recommend buyers to collect easports games and the espn games aswell, so you guys can have a huge mixed up sports games collection. Any ways, if you readers are sure that you enjoy this wonderful game, then buy it. To prove to you it rocks, see all pictures on the screenshot section and make sure that you don't just like the game because of the graphics but because of the thrill of realisms.

INTRODUCTIONMass Effect, by Electronic Arts (EA), sets the benchmark for third person role playing actions games. It is as close to a DVD movie as a video game can get, because, unlike most first person games, players can see and hear the player character as well as the non-player characters (NPCs).  This movie-like quality greatly enhances the compelling story, which is the hallmark of the Mass Effect Trilogy.THE PLOT**Spoiler Alert**This second episode of the Mass Effect Trilogy begins with the death (yes, DEATH) of Commander Shepard, in a fiery ambush of the Normandy, two years after he/she defeated the traitorous Saren Arterius in the battle of the Citadel.  But, thank the goddess, he/she is later resurrected in Project Lazarus by the Illusive Man, leader of Cerberus, a shadowy and ruthless "human supremacist" organization, for the sole purpose of sending the legendary commander to investigate a new cataclysmic event in the Galaxy - entire human colonies have been vanishing without a trace, leaving behind empty buildings. To confront the threat, Shepard travels across the Galaxy to recruit up to a dozen of the most dangerous characters to his/her elite team, at locations including Illium, an asari colony, and Omega, a lawless mining station built on a hollowed out asteroid in the Terminus Systems, for a mission from which every member of the team, including Commander Shepard, may never return.**End of  Possible Spoilers**THE CHARACTERSPlayers who had completed Mass Effect 1 (ME1) can import a Save Game from the list of Character Saves  into Mass Effect 2 (ME2).  During the file transfer, they have the option of changing the class of Commander Shepard, for example, from adept to vanguard, as well as his/her physical characteristics. This is possible in the storyline on account of Project Lazarus--a very clever way of putting Shepard on reset. If  Shepard was imported at a high level in ME1, players will be awarded with bonus squad points and research metals at the start.  (See my comment dated 2/3/10.) All the NPCs who were alive at the end of the ME1 are transferred. Furthermore, the story in ME2 unfolds in accordance with the decisions made by the players in ME1, for example, whether Shepard set the Rachni queen free in Noveria, whether he/she resolved the conflict with Wrex on Virmire peacefully, or whether he/she called in the human fleet to save the Council in the battle of the Citadel. The main storyline, however, remains unchanged.  For those who never play ME1, ME2 can be played stand-alone with new characters and certain pre-set assumptions on events in ME1. (See Update below) New characters in ME2 include Thane, a drell master assassin, Legion, a free-thinking geth, who is stalking Commander Shepard, and Subject Zero, a female human biotic gang and cult member, with head-to-toe tattoos. Other than the geth and the Reapers, new enemies emerge in ME2. They include the Collectors, a winged insect-like species who are suspected to be working for the Reapers, and Scions, which are grotesque experiments of the Reaper, as well as monstrous beings created by the Reapers out of other species they abducted.THE GAME/COMBAT SYSTEMThe Artificial Intelligence (AI) and combat system have been vastly improved in ME2.  Gone are those annoying texture pop-ups in ME1.  So are those long elevator rides--they are replaced with loading screens.  Battle scenes are more realistic: enemies are thrown against walls, limbs are blown off, and wounded fighters continue to fight by crawling on the ground.  Players can hit the enemies where they place the reticles, like in a shooter.  (This is not so in ME1, where hits are calculated based on the number of skill points assigned by the players to the characters.)  Players can now issue attack orders to Shepard's squad mates by using the directional-pad of the controller (of the Xbox 360), and manually prompt Commander Shepard to duck behind covers.  The limitless ammo is no more in ME2.  It is replaced with removable "thermal clips".  When a clip is spent, it must be ejected and replaced with a new one. Players are therefore advised to take note of the amount of thermo clips available during battles.  Instead of only four weapon types as in ME1, there are nineteen in ME2. One of my gripes with ME1 was the lack of heavy hand-held weapons.  In ME2, they are available to the soldier class player character (as well as Commander Shepard of all classes).  These heavy weapons knock down multiple enemies in one gigantic blast.  A sentinel class player character now dons an ablation tactical armor, which makes him/her very tough to kill.  An engineer class player character can launch a drone to aid him/her in battle.  An adept class player character can spawn micro-singularities around the enemies, annihilating them en masse. Tactical cloak, which renders a combatant invisible briefly, is available to an infiltrator class player character.  A vanguard class player character can dash around the battlefield with a new biotic power--the "biotic charge", which propels him/her forward at tremendous speed and force, to attack or evade the enemies.  There is no longer any class restriction in armor.  Medi-gel, used in the ME1 to regenerate health, is replaced with auto-regeneration, although the players still need it to cast the Unity reviving power.  (Note: auto-regeneration is also available in ME1, but only as an upgrade to the armors.)THE DIALOGUEThe dialogue wheel in ME1 is the most innovative dialogue system in all the games I have ever played.  When used probably, it delivers a continuous and seamless dialogue, and hence the movie-like quality of the game.  In ME2, the dialogue wheel is further improved.  A new "interrupt" system is introduced. When prompted by the players with the left or right trigger of the controller (of the Xbox 360), Commander Shepard can interrupt the dialogue with "heroic" or "hostile" action to get the answer he/she wants.  Furthermore, instead of the previous static camera position in ME1, the camera moves around during conversations in ME2, adding further cinematic effect to the game.THE CHOICESLike in ME1, choices made by the players influence the outcome of the game in ME2.  For example, in ME1, on the planet Virmire, Commander Shepard (and hence the players), was called upon to decide which of the two squad mates he/she would rescue; the one left behind was consumed in a subsequent nuclear blast.  In the same manner, decisions of the players in ME2 throughout the game may eventually lead to the annihilation of the entire ground team in the final mission, including Commander Shepard, or the survival of every team member, or something in between. Players with a "dead" Shepard will not be able to import him/her into ME3. The same thing is true with a "dead" teammate.  They can play ME3 with a generic Shepard, but not "their" Shepard.  Furthermore, with Shepard killed, players can't return to the game world after the final mission and continue to play, for example, to complete a side quest, or to explore a new locale.  They will have to start a new game or reload with a previous save-file and replay part of the game for a different outcome.  This gives incentive to players to make sound decisions throughout the game, before heading into the final mission.  (See my comment dated 4/23/10.)THE CERBERUS NETWORKThe Cerberus Network is a cleverly designed in-game portal through which players can access "Downloadable Contents (DLCs)" from EA.  Players activate this network with a one-time access code, which is included in every new game purchase.  Game renters and used game buyers will have to pay for the code.  This arrangement is apparently a ploy by EA to combat the rental and used game market, which has been undermining retail sales of new games.  Players who access the network will receive the first DLC pack on January 26, 2010, the date on which the game is released in North America.  This first DLC introduces Zaeed, a rough and tumble mercenary who will join Shepard's elite team.  A future DLC will introduce the Hammerhead, a hover tank to replace the much-maligned Mako in ME1.  (Note: There is no driveable vehicle in the core game.) In addition, new missions and in-game items will be released to gamers by EA through this network.CONCLUSIONME2 comes with 2 discs.  Players have to swap discs (twice per game) at some points. There are 90 voice actors playing 546 characters with over 30,000 lines of dialogue. New voice actors in ME2 include D.C. Douglas, Martin Sheen and Adam Baldwin.  In conclusion, ME2 is a role-playing game with the look and feel of a shooter.  It is a must-have game of the year.Update: A ME2 DLC called Genesis allows a new player to make major decisions in ME1 without having to play it.  Check it out.
Having played ME2 3 times, I find it rather more difficult to talk about ME2 without making reference to ME1 as there are so many aspects between the 2 games that are interrelated.  Therefore, if you have not play ME1, I recommend that you do so, but please be aware of ME1's DRM with limited activation - which is removed for ME2; ME2 uses a disc check type DRM with no online or limited  activation - which is very acceptable to me.Now that we got DRM out of the way, the fact that you can import saved games from ME1 into Me2 is an awesome feature that let you continue the adventure and exploits of Commander Sheppard - and indeed, it is a grand adventure as Bioware continues its masterful tradition of blending story telling with gaming experience.  So, no complain with the story department (OK, one thing:  What really happened to the Spectres between ME1 and ME2 ?), but there are some concerns in the gameplay.  However, I find the changes in ME2 hard to describe in term of straight up pro and con; that is, there is both pro and con in every changes.  Therefore, I'll just pick the most prominent and discuss it.First of all, it is a shame that RPG elements are scaled back big time from ME1.  Although in all honesty, I have to give Bioware credits for having the guts to eliminate everything that was not implemented well in ME1 which includes the following:-The Mako Rover:  The control is clumsy (especially on the Xbox 360; I load the games just to confirm this) but I love the planetary exploration capability of an armed space aged Humvee.  In ME2, you now have a shuttle that drops you right into the action.  Streamlined ? Yes, but I think it would be more fun and realistic to have both the shuttle with a small rover for a real sense of exploration.  Furthermore, I really miss the inspiring panoramic vistas from ME1.  Boring Planet scanning in place of the Mako is hardly an improvement and felt even more tedious at times.-Inventory screen: Again, streamline is the key word here, where there is now very limited variation of equipment and armament in ME2 with limited upgrade options.  There is no more grenade, but addition of BFG type weapons - including two different types of grenade launchers -  is a big plus).  Like the Mako, I admit that ME1 console style inventory is clumsy, but I still love tinkering with party inventory in spite of the painful experience.-Omni Gel: Mutiple use in ME1, but most notable for giving you the option not having to  mess with decryption.  Gone in ME2, you have no choice but to put up with the decryption mini game - which Andrew Dice Clay would probably compares to `masturbating with a cheese grater: slightly amusing... but mostly painful !'-Also, outside of the Normandy, you have very limited option to talk to your teammate on a mission.  I am fairly sure this is minor to most Gamers as most of the time your teammates just repeat the comments, but it is a big part of the overall RPG experience for me.-Combat: Now this is a very positive change. Soldier is now the best class IMO because the shooter elements are vastly improved.  Everything from cover function to weapon effect - including weapon effectiveness - are better than ME1.  In addition, I welcome the addition of ammo requirement (or whatever the lame explanation for the heat clip is) as it adds to the realism.  Also, in line with a true shooter instead of a RPG, weapon accuracy depends largely on the players' aiming skill - not how much XP points you put into the weapons itself (a feature of a more traditional RPG). This is also a big change to the level up option - which is also `streamlined' - which, again, really means more limitation.However, please do not expect ME2 to be a hardcore FPS like Half-Life or STALKERS, because you will be disappointed.  The TPS works great on consoles, but is still lacking, and cannot compare to a fully functional FPS  with true leaning, jumping, crouching, or prone options.  Generally, moving in and out of cover don't always work well. And don't be surprise to find out that as you pop out of cover, your target is obstructed by... none other but yourself.  Regardless, combat in ME2 is generally fun if not thrilling - but I just want more RPG elements retained on top of the shooter elements improvements.-Another plus is that there are more team members to recruit.  You now have up to 10 to 12 team members - including 2 returning members from ME1 back for another romp through the galaxy.  Mordin the Salarian is the highlight IMO.  Also, more companions also means more ...-...Romance options this time around.  Personally, I am beginning to find it to be a distraction.  Some flirting conversation options are nice, but actively pursuing a romance is getting somewhat tiring.  I was simply being nice to a certain volatile female member when all of a sudden, I was in a ... "relationship".  Honestly, romance options are nice in an RPG, but realistically from a Military point of view, what we really need is more places like Omega's After Life club with an expanded line of `services'.By the way, I cannot get enough of the Quarians and their Migrant Fleet. They remind me so much of both the space faring Bentusi and the `Exiles' in their quest to reclaim their "Homeworld" (an awesome RTS game in space.  BTW, Bioware flat out refers to the Quarians' home planet as "Homeworld".)Finally, although not as well done as ME1, you still get to connect to different members of your squad and you do feel that lingering sense of loss when they die. Therefore, I'd like to offer some helpful tips on how to keep all members in your squad alive(MILD SPOILER WARNING):-Be sure to upgrade the Normandy.-Pick an alignment - either Paragon or Renegade - and stick with it.  There are some exceptions where you have to `cross over' because the interruption options are too fun to pass up; but other than this, keep to your alignment as much as you can.  Besides having more conversation options available, having a high alignment also helps the next point...-Be sure all members of your squad is LOYAL by doing all loyalty missions.  It is helpful to do the loyalty mission for Jack and Legion last - with at 3 full bars on your alignment meter, or more. (In addition, earning squad members' loyalties unlock new abilities; abilities that you can `siphon' from)(END SPOILER)In conclusion, ME2 is what I consider a light-weight RPG that meshes well with a middle-weight TPS (more RPS - role playing shooter - than RPG).  Personally, I had hoped that Bioware would  improve ME1's shortcoming instead of eliminating them altogether. However, if Bioware keeps up the trend, then everything bad or questionable in ME2 will be eliminated in ME3 as well - at least, I hope so.  As is, in spite of its shortcomings in the RPG department, ME2 is still a fun and thrilling sci-fi adventure and a great gaming experience; and comes close to topping ME1 - but no cigar.  Regardless, if you ever own a telescope to gaze at the stars late into the night and wonder what possibilities are out there, ME2 is totally worth it.
Mass Effect - Circa 2010GOOD:- A third person shooting and cover system similar to that of Gears of War or Resident Evil 5 - like in the first Mass Effect. The combat system works better then it did in the first game and is still a blast to play while keeping it a more realistic gameplay experience (over then lets say a turn based RPG). While the combat system still has a few hiccups (its still not as flawless as lets say Gears of War 2's combat) it works well enough not to be a concern and feels like a great aspect to this title.- A well thought out and well played story that rivals or bests that of games like Grand Theft Auto, Fallout or any Final Fantasy game for that matter. Much like the first game the story is it told through dialog (which you control the direction of) between you and other characters and because of the choices of make during the story it has a "choose your own adventure" feel to it. Much like other known Bioware games like Dragon Age or even Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.- Gorgeous graphics and effects that rival that of any action game like that of Assassins Creed 2, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 or Bayonetta.- Much like the first title this one still has a great sound track that still has that movie like quality of the great Sci-Fi Space movies from the past like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Wars, & Dune.- You can port over your character from the first Mass Effect and all your story choices will carry over as well or your can start an entirely new character if you like.BAD:- The Mining mini-game is slow and tedious but necessary to unlock better weapons and upgrades. Now the way the Mining mini-game works is by scanning a planets for elements and shooting a probe in the area of a planet that has needed recourses.- This game still has a more then a few loading sequences during gameplay that might upset impatient gamers. It should be noted that installing the game (both discs) to your Xbox 360 harddrive (if you have room) will make the loading a bit faster.IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- The story of the game is mostly told through dialogs between yourself and other characters in the game, it should really be noted that your choices in responding to questions asked of you and your reactions to events unfolding around you is going to change the story of the game overall and attitudes of others around you as well. It should also be noted that during the games story you can make choices that either make your character into a brash loose cannon who cheats, steals and shoots first asks questions later or a by the book fighter for justice and freedom with good moral values and willingness to sacrifice personal wants for the good of others.- Much like the first game, you travel to many different worlds/solar systems through out the Milky Way galaxy (the galaxy we all currently live in, in real life) with your own star ship the Normandy and its crew. During your missions you get to bring two of the total eleven other characters with you and these other characters (all eleven of them) have their stats as well as weapons be chosen by you.- A Sci-Fi RPG with lots of Third Person Shooter (Camera behind the player) elements. The games combat has much quicker pacing then most other RPGs like that of Demon Souls on PS3 or Fallout 3. And now the over all combat has been sped up a bit more then in the first game and the controls have been improved more well this makes Mass Effect 2's combat gameplay very much like that of other main stream First/Third Person Shooters like Halo ODST or and Gears of War 2.- Like the first game and like in many other "western made RPGs" (made in America/Europe/Canada and oppose to eastern made RPGs like Final Fantasy of Japan) like Dragon Age, Oblivion, or Fallout 3 this game has lots of dialog and story, which plays a very big role in game and setting the tone. This will turn will turn off those gamers looking for fast paced action title with little interruption like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.- No inventory or way to equip your allies with new armor. The long-standing inventory system you might see in a game like Resident Evil 5 or the first Mass Effect was removed completely in favor for something similar to something like an action game you get only one copy of each gun and armor (and you can not sell them), now you can buy upgrades for them as well as get new guns (but once you have them you can not sell those as well). The over all effect is something like a combination of a weapons cache of a FPS like Half-Life 2 (getting guns you cannot sell or lose) and an RPG since you can upgrade these weapons. Now this is streamlining was done for most non-RPG gameplayers, but the choice is a little disturbing to hardcore RPG-players.- A new addition to the combat in Mass Effect 2 is of all things, ammo. This may sound odd to anyone who has not played the first Mass Effect since that game's weapons never needed ammo and could only over heat. The ammo system in Mass Effect 2 work feels very much like any other First/Third Person Shooters like Halo 3.- Still no multiplayer or online gameplay.GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Mass Effect (360/PC)- Fallout 3 (360/PS3/PC)- Gears of War 2 (360/PC)- Borderlands (360/PS3/PC)ADDITIONAL NOTES:- You do not need to beat the first Mass Effect to play or beat this title. But, doing so will give you a better understanding of Mass Effect 2's story overall and if you port over a character from the first Mass Effect you'll get more dialog options as well as a boon of in-game cash. Also the first Mass Effect was a great game to that should not be missed.- In the limited collectors edition of Mass Effect 2 you will find a Cerberus Network pass code (more on this below) art book, the first issue to the limited run four issue Mass Effect comic (called Mass Effect: Redemption) as well as a bonus a DVD with a making of Mass Effect 2 video DVD also has PC wallpapers (of the Mass Effect 2 locations and new characters). The collectors edition also has a code to download from EA/Bioware home website a set new armor and rifle for the game (it's based on the new emeny you meet in the game and looks pretty cool) and this it all comes in a tin as well as paper case.- Check out the Mass Effect novels called Mass Effect: Revelation and Mass Effect: Ascension these books have a great deal of background story for the two games.- The Cerberus Network download that will enable future downloads for Mass Effect 2 via EA's and Bioware websites. The Cerberus Network download is about $15 on Xbox Live and free if you buy the limited collectors edition of Mass Effect 2. Bioware said that all Mass Effect 2 downloads will come via Cerberus Network and most will even be free.- There is already free downloadable content for Mass Effect 2 (a new Shotgun and new Armor) and lots more on the way. It should be noted you'll first need the Cerberus Network download to access this.

There are plenty of reviews on the actual game which is absolutely amazing. My review is about what you get in the collector's edition specifically and what you're getting for the extra $20. The collector's edition is really just the regular game in a nicer looking metal case, DLC content, and some physical extras thrown in. I'll go through the physical extras first. The exclusive "lithograph" of the Normandy is pretty small (4 by 6 inches) and of pretty poor quality in my opinion. I honestly think you could probably get a high resolution image of the Normandy online, download it onto a flash drive, take it in for photo development, and get something nicer. The stock of the paper used is notable poor and pretty pathetic for something that claims to be a lithograph. The exclusive "N7" patch you get isn't like normal patches that you have to sew on. It pretty much looks and feels like a velcro patch that you can slap on to something velcro would stick to. The quality and finish of the artwork on the patch is pretty solid though. The tin that you get the game in is nice looking and is fairly detailed in the prints of both male Shepard and female Shepard on either side of the case (male on the front, female on the back). Though I imagine for most people they won't be looking at it anytime soon since the mass effect 3 disc will be inside their xbox/ps3/pc for a while. The exclusive hardcover art book is pretty nice as well, though really it's just a miniature version of the larger "Art of the Mass Effect Universe" book that you can get from bookstores or Amazon today. Still it's a nice edition that adds a little extra if you like looking through concept art behind the Mass Effect universe. It doesn't really have anything more or less than what you've seen from other game art books. The comic book is also kind of a nice throw in, and is listed as "limited edition," though I have a feeling that the "limited" part comes in because it's got unique cover art work and not because the comic itself is limited. Also of note the physical disc you get also has "Collector's Edition" text stamped on it, to make you feel extra special. That about wraps up what you get in terms of physical goodies.Now what you're really buying with the collector's edition is extra DLC content. The Xbox version gets a Normandy Xbox Live prop that you can put along with your avatar. All versions get the N7 Arsenal Pack, which gets you 4 unique weapons, alternate costumes for squad-members Liara, Ashley, Kaidan, and James, an extra casual outfit hoodie for Shepard to wear on the ship, and a robotic dog. The weapons I have mixed opinions on because they are heavier than other default guns you can get, and in Mass Effect 3 carrying heavier guns means your powers recharge slower. They're decently powerful, and the N7 Eagle pistol in particular is pretty cool because it's actually a full-auto pistol unlike all the other pistols, but they are far from being the best in their class IMO. Unlike in Mass Effect 2 however the alternate costumes for your squad-mates are actually useful because they give them different bonuses. For example one costume might give a 25% faster recharge time, and another one a 25% weapons damage boost, etc.  The hoodie is pretty much just a N7 hoodie that Shepard gets to wear while walking around casually, not much else I can say about it. The robotic dog I thought would be more interactive but he pretty much just wanders around in the lowest level of the ship not doing much. Maybe I haven't really played around to see what else he can do yet, but so far he's just been doing his own thing. The other big thing you get is the first Mass Effect 3 DLC "From Ashes," which includes extra missions, a new gun, and a extra squad-mate. I haven't really done this mission and found this extra squad-mate yet to give details, but considering Mass Effect 3 already has a smaller roster of squad-mates available I'd say it's a pretty solid extra to get with your Collector's edition. You also get a Mass Effect soundtrack, but it's given via a reedemable code that you have to use on the main bioware website and not on a physical disc. The quality of the tracks sounds pretty good from my laptop speakers, though I haven't been able to check the bitrate etc. on them or listen to them over my good earphones yet.  The final thing you get are some additional forum badges, avatars, etc. for use on the official bioware Mass Effect website forums to let everyone know you're rocking the collector's edition. I don't really care too much about it, but it's a nice way to help make you feel like you got something for your money.Overall I'd say the collector's edition is a definite buy over the standard edition, if you can find it (Amazon so far is the only place I see it in stock). The DLC content alone is worth the extra $20 looking at just the digital content alone. The N7 Arsenal Pack would cost at least $10 and last I checked "The Arrival" DLC is also $10 on PSN and Xbox Live today. That's assuming the N7 arsenal pack is ever officially released for purchase since it's right now being touted as a Collector's edition exclusive. Combined with the other physical extras and digital perks thrown in like the digital soundtrack etc., I'd say you're more than getting your extra $20's worth. If you're a longtime Mass Effect fan like I am I'd say go for the Collector's edition definitely. If you're someone new to the franchise and are just checking things out, I think you could get by with just going for the standard edition if money is a issue, since you're just paying for extra DLC content and physical goodies catered more to fans of the series. But if you were even thinking about picking up DLC content for Mass Effect 3 at some point, you're getting a better value by buying the Collector's edition now and paying the $20 upfront. Feel free to ask me any questions you might have. Hope the review helps in making a decision.Also as a side note, if you're new to the franchise I strongly suggest you buy Mass Effect 2 and import you character after beating it. You'll get a much more immersive experience. Also the PS3 verison of Mass Effect 2 comes with a good chunk of the DLC and a interactive comic that goes through the major decisions from Mass Effect 1, whereas the Xbox version does not. I'd recommend the PS3 version over the Xbox one for that reason alone (not to mention you don't need to swap discs with the PS3 version). But definitely buy the collector's edition of Mass Effect 3 now if you're interested, since I doubt it'll remain in stock much longer.
This review is for Mass Effect 2 Xbox 360.I played through Mass Effect 1 on the PC and was disappointed to learn that had I played Mass Effect 1 on the Xbox, I could import my save game and get some nifty bonuses, along with the Long Service Award achievement. In order to get this achievement without importing a ME1 save, one has to play through ME2 twice. I will cut to the chase and say I really liked ME2, but not enough to play through it again immediately and possibly not on the Insanity difficulty (to get yet another achievement). The default actions from ME1 include Wrex dying on Virmire, and the Alliance Council being led by humans with Udina as the ambassador. When I finished ME1 on the PC, Wrex was alive, and the original Council was saved with Anderson being the ambassador.Initially, managing 5 resources gets very tedious as your character can't afford to do research or buy upgrades without resources like credits, element zero, iridium, platinum, and palladium. Once you use probes to obtain these resources on planets (once you get to about 50k for element zero and 150k-200k for the metals, you can stop) it isn't as big of a problem but obtaining upgrades still requires credits. Playing through ME2 once, my character was still about 3000 experience points away from level 30 (which would have yielded another achievement) even though I explored every single planet and completed every side mission I could find. Managing the fuel and probes for the Normandy while exploring star systems was something I would have eliminated. It was unnecessary and didn't add anything to the gaming experience. Once you run out of fuel, EDI uses some palladium to tow your vessel back to the mass relay - not a big loss to be honest.The use of thermal clips is somewhat of a pain because in the later and more difficult stages, you quickly run out of thermal clips. Even with the Revanant Light Machine Gun (which has lots of ammo), I ran out at the final boss and had to finish him off with the pistol. In ME1, your weapon has unlimited ammo and just has a tendency to overheat which requires a cool down period. In ME2, you use thermal clips which in effect is ammunition.The mini-games are an improvement over those of ME1, but they are still tedious and waste time. They net you mostly credits with the occasional upgrade, and are often used to continue the mission (door, computer, etc...) The data hacking and bypass games require matching icons or screenshots.The Hammerhead is gone, and in its place is a shuttle that you can't fly/control. The Firewalker DLC gives you a hovertank, which is easier to control than the ME1 Hammerhead. I hear there is a ME2 DLC that gives you the Hammerhead.There are several DLC that have their own achievements, which makes it impossible to have 100% achievement completion unless you pay for the DLC. Adding up the cost in Microsoft points to purchase these DLC add-ons, it is the same price as the full game and the DLC just add a few side-quests. The Lair of the Shadow Broker has received high ratings, but I am not about to pay that much to find out.I also enjoyed the music soundtrack from ME1, which is sorely lacking in ME2. The ME2 music is typical video game stuff, while ME1 reminded me of the movie Blade Runner. Many of the main planets/stations are significantly smaller than the ones in ME1. For instance, the Citadel is now basically Zakera Ward and Captain Anderson's office in the Presidium! Tuchanka and Illium are major planets, yet your character only gets to visit one tiny portion of each area.Besides the DLC achievements, 2 achievements that require a lot of time/patience to obtain are the long service award (unless you import a ME1 save) and completing the game in insanity difficulty.The voice acting in ME2 is top notch! Martin Sheen is the Illusive Man, Yvonne Strahovski (Agent Sarah Walker from Chuck) is Miranda and Miranda is even modeled to resemble Yvonne, Adam Baldwin (Animal Mother from Full Metal Jacket, Colonel Casey from Chuck) is a Quarian commando leader, Claudia Black (Pitch Black, Farscape), and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity from Matrix) are just a few of the celebrities that lended their voices for the game. I noticed that the Collectors resembled Pilot from Farscape. And yes, I did look up interviews of Yvonne on YouTube to hear her real Australian accent!The controls are intuitive, and the AI isn't too bad. Your squadmates generally obey your orders but sometimes get in the way or enjoy getting killed by disobeying your commands. The loyalty factor in your teams is a good touch but it starts to get confusing when you have such a large team. I liked how a Geth joins your team, and there are more options for relationships in ME2.Pros: Fixed a lot of the issues I had with ME1, intuitive controls, easy inventory and upgrade system, excellent voice actingCons: Too many resources to manage, thermal clips, mini-games are annoying, DLC add-ons are rather expensive and have their own achievements, lack of good music to set the mood, there's no way to port my ME1 PC savegame to ME2 Xbox. I know this is a silly request, but doing a Google search shows a lot of people asking the same thing.Overall: 4/5 stars! If you're into RPG's like Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, but also enjoy Sci-Fi, and  3rd-person shooters, definitely play Mass Effect 1 and 2!
My review is in 2 parts, one for content (story, etc.), which contains spoilers, the other for gameplay, which does not contain spoilers (barely anyway).  At this point, I have completed the game twice (once on Insanity difficulty).  I currently have another playthrough where I am 2/3rds done, and several others that I have just started.  This review is entirely dependent on my experience with Mass Effect 1, and is a comparison, in order to point out the best features of both.  In general, I will start with the negatives for each component (content and gameplay), as these are important elements I want fixed for ME3, then I'll gently segue into the good stuff, then probably vacillate from there.  My one sentence summary: gameplay better than ME1, story worse.1. Story (SPOILERS)- Relatable villain - There is no relatable (humanoid) villain in ME2.  ME1 had Saren, who was an awesome character with good writing and great voice acting.  ME2 only has the collector general. who becomes briefly relatable in the last seconds of the ending.  It has Harbinger, but he's (it's) just the Sovereign of this chapter.  The Illusive Man doesn't count, as he is more of an ally, but an untrustworthy one.  ME3 needs a humanoid, relatable bad guy, and Bioware really needs to deliver on this one.- Lack of Reaper "evidence" - It's ME2, Sovereign crashed into the Citadel in his death throes at the end of ME1, and no one still believes Commander Shepard that the Reapers are real?  REALLY!?  That's ridiculous.  The excuse with the Vigil VI scene is that Vigil on Ilos now has run out of batteries.  REALLY?!  Couldn't they recharge them?  Didn't Shepard or Tali record Vigil's message with an Omni-tool?  This is the most preposterous pill to swallow in ME2.  I will not tolerate this garbage in ME3.  I DO NOT WANT TO SPEND ANY TIME IN ME3 CONVINCING OTHER CHARACTERS THAT THE REAPERS ARE A REAL THREAT.  That's stupid, ridiculous, not believable, and hence bad story telling.  Everyone should recognize by ME3 the real Reaper threat, they may just think they can escape and don't have to fight it...Council - also, I shouldn't have to be fighting the Council so much in ME3, that's getting old too.Thane - lame character.  Any time he started talking about himself I just kept saying, "don't care, don't care."  He looks great, his voice acting is great (ALL voice acting in ME2 is great, even better than ME1), but the writing is just poor for his character.  As an assassin, he is a lame, movie stereotype assassin.  One character sends you a message that Thane moved "like a dancer."  Worst cliche ever.  On his loyalty mission (which was lame), he "disappears" just as a person walks past him.  Wow, he's that fast.  I've never seen that in a bad movie before.  All his business about dying and wanting to re-connect with his son... yawn.  I am making sure that this character dies on all my playthroughs, so I don't have to see him in ME3.Samara - Again, great voice acting.  Though I did hate her stupid outfit.  I'm a hetero guy, but I still don't care about seeing her stupid cleavage.  Her story is just not believable.  Mainly for this reason:  I simply do not buy that the asari, being as reasonable as they are, would have or allow Justicars (or anything like it) to exist in their culture.  This is too big an anomoly in asari culture for me to believe it.  I might believe it in the asari's distant past, but not something that still exists.  So I didn't buy into her motivations or story at all.  As such, I am killing Samara off in all my playthroughs as well.  This is really the only additional detail on the asari given in ME2, and I hate it.  I would like more asari culture details in ME3, but I'd like something believable that fits who they are.Music - not as good or as haunting as ME1.  I will not buy the ME2 soundtrack.  I have the ME1 soundtrack and listen to it all the time.  Later on in ME2, the music gets better.  Missing the Virmire Ride soundtrack for exploration in a vehicle.  I also miss the music from ME1 right after you kill Fist, on the way to save Tali (which is also replayed on Virmire).  This was my favorite track and really missed it on the ME1 CD soundtrack, would have been nice to hear it again in ME2.Loyalty - In general, many of the loyalty missions are all about fixing a side character's family problems.  Yawn.  Thane, Samara, Jacob, Miranda.  All lame loyalty missions, although at least the action was fun for Jacob and Miranda's.Squad-mate conflicts - Legion and Tali have one, Jack and Miranda have one, but why not Grunt and Mordin?  That's just... really weird and neglectful.  We finally get a salarian squad mate, and all the krogan seem to accept or ignore him without issue.  Weird.  Then again, the krogan don't seem to react to Garrus, a turian, either.  What gives?Ilium - in general, I found pretty much every mission on Ilium to be lame.  Then again in retrospect, I also found Noveria on ME1 to be the weakest main mission.  Maybe Bioware is having problems "selling" these kinds of environments, not sure.  In ME1, the problem was mainly pacing (and too many elevator rides!), in ME2, I just didn't care about all the stories that take place here.Liara- not sure what to think here.  Liara pulls a complete 180, and I'm not sure what to say.  It definitely seems completely unnatural for her, and unless I get an incredibly good explanation in ME3, I will look back at this part as unbelievable and stupid and something Liara would never do.  I since followed up and read the graphic novel, which fills in the gaps.  It's OK, but still not entirely convincing of Liara's change of character.Squad mates - they are generally cooler in ME1.  The promotional trailers for ME2 that featured the characters were lame and made the characters seem lame.  However, Mordin is awesome!  Give us more details on the salarians, please.  As much as you can.  I want to see more salarian info in ME3.  Grunt - Again, I didn't like him in the promo trailers, but he turned out to be a pretty cool character in the game.  The writing for him was good, and his dialogue can be pretty funny.  Still not as cool as Wrex though.  Bring back Wrex in ME3!  Zaeed Masani (downloadable free with collector's edition) is an awesome character: writing appearance, story, acting.  Great job.  Zaeed, Grunt, Mordin, Legion and Tali really received the best overall story details and awesome moments in this game.  I can't rave enough about Tali's recruitment and especially her loyalty mission.  I'd better see the Quarians role in all of this in ME3.  Best new characters have to be Zaeed, Legion, and Mordin, hands down.  Jack is pretty good, too.  But she would have been more convincing if she were more overtly powerful in gameplay.Dr. Okeer - OK, this guy is my favorite new character in all of ME2.  He is the ultimate krogan!  His speech is phenomenal.  To me, he is the real hero of ME2.  If you don't know what I mean, listen to his speech again and consider all the themes in ME and everything that's happened thus far.  To bad he had to die.ME3 Squadmates - I better have the choice to use all the ME1 squad mates who survived in ME3.  Also, ME3 should probably only have 1 or 2 new squadmates, at best.  The menu of choices across ME1 and ME2 is more than enough.  Do not bring back Ashley's penchant for poetry though, because that was a horribly portrayed and executed stereotype.  I know no one that I want to talk to who recites poetry in that lame a fashion.  No thanks.Tuchanka - best overall new planet, with Omega a close second to coolest new planet/location.  Hope we get more of the krogran story in ME3.Migrant Fleet - this experience was pretty cool.  I would also like to see more of the Migrant Fleet in ME3, but with a stronger focus on other aspects, as I think we have seen all we need to of their politics (though it was good).Priceless moments/really disappointing ones - After you kill the Thresher Maw and talk to Wrex, "next you'll tell me he's a quint and craps dark matter."  Hilarious dialogue!  Garrus on discussing his romantic encounter with a fellow military turian, "I had reach, she had flexibility."  That was pretty funny.  Joker's scene with EDI on the ship while it's being invaded by Collectors - awesome.  When Joker starts cursing, it's just priceless.  Cmdr. Shepard after Tali's trial, "we can go back in there and still get you exiled if you want..."  Pretty funny.  Opening scene with the destruction of the Normandy, especially looking outside it's broken hull into space...  Mind blowingly awesome.  Dissappointment - Garrus' introduction is terrible.  His dialogue is bad in this scene, and he never looks at me!  He's looking at the ground or his boot the whole time he talks to me, that's terrible.  In general, Garrus gets so few lines in ME2, and that sucks.  Bring back more of the awesome Garrus I know in ME3.Nagging doubts/concerns - Why does Shepard work for Cerberus again, seriously?  After the stuff you saw them do in ME1, I just can't believe he'd do it.  I would expect Shepard to find and take out the Illusive man instead.  As for the plot, the build-up of this mission as a suicide mission seems kind of fake.  I say this because the stakes in ME1 seemed MUCH higher.  You're stopping the Reapers from wiping out all intelligent organic life.  ME2, you're stopping the Collectors from kidnapping/killing more human colonies, and eventually you find out, humans on earth.  This is definitely a smaller galactic scale.  Not to mention that in ME1, there is a chance that Sovereign could let in the whole reaper fleet...  The Collectors, although powerful, are just the middlemen.  Final fight with a "human" Reaper -- that looked really lame.  Why did they have to make it look so human?  How is that good Dreadnought ship design?  If reapers take the form of those they absorb, then are all Reapers rachni and keepers?  Cause that's what they look like.  How about a Thresher Maw Reaper?  That idea might work.  Anyway, the look of the Reapers should not be so literally tied to who they absorb.  They should explain the "paste" that organic beings get turned into before being made into Reapers a bit more.Story mechanics overall - despite some bad writing, story, and character choices, the mechanics for driving the story have been elevated considerably.  ME2 is great in delivering a truly interactive action story.  In ME3, they probably don't need any more story telling mechanics, just better story content.2. Gameplay-Cover/Fire/Heal - The general cover and fire system is better in ME2, pretty much ripped straight from Gears of War, which is not a bad thing.  The element of staying in cover to regen health and shields is much better, rather than worrying about using Medigel all the time to heal (now you only use it to revive fallen comrades).Ammo Reload - However this system is an issue.  In gameplay terms, it's annoying that I have to find ammo clips, which are tough to see sometimes.  In terms of ME logic, it makes no sense!  Bioware should change it.  Previously, your gun overheated and there was no need for ammo clips.  Now, we are told that the reload must be done because the block of metal or whatever overheats and must be removed.  I'm fine with that, but I am not cool with having to "insert" another heat clip.  Why can't the heat be contained in a small block, so that I have to snap off a clip of overheated metal, but there's still plenty in the gun to keep firing?  Bioware, take out the unnecessary and annoying find a clip and reload, please!  Or go back to the ME1 overheat mechanic.Bugs - This game actually seems buggier in combat than ME1, which is not cool.  If I am near a badguy and either a barrel explodes or I use Warp, the explosion sometimes instantly transports me on top of a table or a bad guy, or just hovering in the air, and I can't get down!  The only way to get down is use the Vanguard's charge, but that's only if there's at least one opponent left that you can target and you're a Vanguard!  This kind of bug especially punishes players on Insanity difficulty because of the need to reload.  Bioware, don't let this happen in ME3!Bad Squad  AI - while talking about squad mates, how come they are so stupid and get killed all the time?  On Insanity difficulty, they seem especially stupid.  Grunt and Jack are billed as uber super cool bad-a**@s, but they never seem it, as they killed pretty easily, especially Grunt.  Conserving and using medi-gel becomes a huge part of an Insanity playthrough, and dumb squad-mate AI makes this very frustrating.  How hard is it for the AI to keep them behind cover?Targeting with powers - Powers now generally require aiming almost to the same degree as firing guns, this is AWFUL!.  Why should my Singularity or Pull ever miss when my enemy is highlighted in the Pause/Use Powers wheel/screen?  That's ridiculous.  I sometimes wind up targeting the floor, total BS, that shouldn't be possible.  Bioware needs to fix this.Biotic powers appearance - I HATE the Black n Blue "Fireball" that flies out of your hand whenever you use a biotic power!  Lame.  This isn't Dragon Age or D and D.  The dark fireball is fine for Singularity, but all other powers should look like they did in ME1!  (Charge and Shockwave look cool, though).Biotic power chaining - Power Recharge mechanic - Quick biotic power chaining with the same character is now a lot less possible, which is not cool!  This removes some of the fun factor, it needs to be added back.  Reduce recharge time on all biotic powers.  I want my adept to chain multiple combinations of different powers more easily.  I would like to point out that I do like how biotic powers magnify their damage if you use one power right after another.  Pull, then Warp.  The extra damage effect here is cool (and sometimes really bloody), and even makes a kind of sense.Charge and Shockwave are two awesome new powers.  However, from a content perspective, Charge has nothing to do with Dark Energy.  You are passing through solid matter, which clearly means you have become or are surrounded by Dark Matter.  Just a quibble, unless ME technology has always been based on DM and DE, and I missed it.  Always thought it was supposed to be based on DE though.3 main defenses - I don't like how the 3 defenses work as-is in ME2.  For ME3, Bioware should focus on bringing back some of the ME1 logic.  In ME1, everything is generated by a Mass Effect field, so anyone protected by one (of any kind, shield or "barrier" which was just an uber shield in ME1) should be affected by Warp.  I am OK with Warp working BETTER against a biotic barrier, but it should still do SOMETHING against a technological shield.  Likewise, Overload, since its supposed to be a combination of overload and sabotage from ME1, should work on anyone using technological weaponry!  A biotic barrier should not prevent this!  Again, I am fine with Overload working better against "shields" and robots, but it should always deal damage to someone using weapons (purely organic enemies with no weapons are the only ones who should be unaffected by Overload).  And Incinerate should be mostly blocked by barriers/shields, but SOME damage should still be done.  I am generally in favor of my approach rather than returning to ME1's mechanic/logic, as my suggestion still allows for ME2's strategy of power use, which I like.  It just needs to make more ME science sense!  Depsite the attempt at bifurcating Warp and Overload (and Barrier/shields), they still made Warp (and hence Warp Ammo) the uber power, as it destroys Barriers and armor really well.  Since there is less focus on synthetic enemies in this chapter, there is less focus on shields, and so Overload isn't as useful (even though it works great on unshielded synthetic enemies).  I intentionally used "bifurcate" even though, in the end, I am really talking about all 3 defenses and all 3 direct damage powers (and ammo types).  Overload/shield is the only one that can't hurt organic, unshielded enemies.  This makes Disruptor ammo, Overload, and Energy Drain useless in all the later main storyline missions, from Horizon onward.  When you know you're fighting the Collectors, these powers are practically worthless.Squad-matePowers - Your squadmates now only have two active powers (at most) and one passive class power.  They can unlock a fourth power, which is oftentimes an ammo power.  I realize Bioware was trying to simplify, but this is too much.  This power selection sometimes forces you to bring certain squadmates that I don't want to bring.  For slightly better versatility, they should give squadmates one more ACTIVE power (not a passive nor an ammo power, unless the character does not have an ammo power yet). There should also be a way to "re-spec" your squad-mates powers in case you made a mistake.Leveling-up -- In a way, ME2 is better on this.  It is better to receive XP at the end of a mission, so it doesn't break up the action, that change makes sense.  What doesn't make sense is having it cost 10 xp to max out a power, but you need to spend 1, 2, 3, or 4 points in one shot!  There are only 4 levels of power for each talent.  Why do I have to have unspent points floating around in my Squad screen?  This is just stupid!  Why didn't Bioware just make each talent have 10 "levels" of power, but the only meaningful increases in power are at levels 1, 3, 6, and 10?  The math would work out EXACTLY the same, but you wouldn't have to deal with unspent points.Concussive Shot - Who took my BOOMSTICK away?  Seriously, the shotgun was the most fun weapon in ME1, because when you used Carnage to fire the big blast, you FELT the giant kickback from the vibrating controller.  Concussive Shot does not have this, making the Soldier even more lame to play.  Bioware, you must add this back!  Make the soldier fun!  His only active powers are adrenaline rush and concussive shot.  Give me my BOOMSTICK back.  Feedback is necessary.New Vehicle - OK the new downloadable vehicle handles much better for driving.  However, the combat with it is just (if not more) iterative and boring!  Why can't Bioware make vehicular combat more interesting?  Firing the same missile and strafing all the time is really boring.  Why not remove vehicle combat altogether, and make the vehicle a purely exploratory experience?  Not sure why, but this new vehicle does not give me the fun "moon rover" experience that the Mako did.  Probably because the levels have less of an area to explore than in ME1, and because the song "Virmire Ride" was not in ME2's soundtrack.  That's Blasphemy!  put that song back in.  They also need at least 5-10 optional planet missions, where you explore a vast expanse!  They could even add more of these planet missions as extra DLC.Armor Customization - The good thing is the removal of the cumbersome inventory.  Great job, Bioware.  Unfortunately, more customization options are still needed.  The appearance of your armor should not be affected by the stat boost you receive from the item!  In short, appearance and mechanical effect should be separate mechanics.  You should be able to make your armor look however you want, regardless of the effects the pieces of armor have.  When you purchase armor upgrade modules, they should be like different batteries or SIM cards that put in your armor, they have a mechanical effect only.  Browsing through your appearance for your armor and its effects should be done in the same menu, though.  With this mechanic, I could have my armor look however I want, but still have it boost my health by 10% and my shieds by 10%, or whatever boosts I choose to equip at that time (there would still be a limit to the number of mechanical boosts you could get to your armor).  Again, we need more choices in how Shepard's armor looks.  Also, the "bonus" armors should NOT force you to wear the helmet everywhere!  This defeats the purporse of wearing the special armors.  I only had to wear my N7 helmet on the Collector ship and certain other missions, why should have to wear the Terminus helmet everywhere?  That makes no sense.Paragon/Renegade - mechanic - they now made your ability to change the story independent from your skill point selection.  This is definitely the better choice, great job.  The interrupt dialogue mechanic is great.  Nothing to change here.Graphics - phenomenal.  The opening scene on the Normanday is crazy, and awesome.  Later in the game, my roommate was watching me play and commented "wow, that alien looks real."  He was talking about Mordin Solus.Omega - looks and sound awesome!Focused, "targeted" missions - I like how I don't need to search through a mission to find all the upgrades, they are mostly along the way.  This means limited need to roam for long periods on foot.  That's general good.  In general, the mission design is great in ME2, the action is awesome.Limited exploration - on the flip side, on foot exploration of the Citadel in ME1 was awesome, and I wish they would put in one location (maybe the rebuilt citadel?) in ME3 that you can explore on foot.  But it should just be one central kind of location.  Generally, in missions, they got it right in ME2, though.Elevators - I am SO sick of elevators.  Why are they still here?  Bioware needs to get rid of them so I don't have to ride one and wait through a loading screen just to talk to one of my squadmates!  Agghhh!Thresher Maw fight/Grunt - this was a huge let down.  They just made it a long, iterative battle.  It feels like the iterations of hits you execute when fighting any fight on Insanity difficulty.  Why can't they do something more dramatic?  Why couldn't Grunt be as awesome as he was in the ME2 trailers?  OK, that good would have made the thresher fight kind of lame, but he needs to be more awesome.  Grunt should have a devasting charge attack (as an activated power -- all krogan should), maybe one that forces a slow motion sequence (you could abort the slow-mo cam with a button press?).  Right now in ME2, Grunt's charge is kind of weak, and Grunt dies too easily.  And for the Thresher Maw, you should be able to get closer.  If you can't kill him in a minute, he either eats you, or runs away if you hurt him bad enough.  You should really have to use terrain in cool ways (like climbing up on high objects) to get a good position on him.  Then maybe Grunt would get close and grapple, shooting it point black or attaching grenades to his flesh.Upgrade System - the method of searching planets to get resources you need to upgrade weapons, is generally lame.  To date, I believe the recent patch on the 360 has sped up the process, it seems so.  Good job Bioware if its true.  It took WAY too long.  Now it's vaguely reasonable.  The game should stil require less time spent on this.  Lastly, they need to remove the "Uncharted Worlds" theme music from this minigame.  Mainly because Bioware completely ruined that great music soundtrack, because now when I listen to it in absentia, I always "hear" the intrusive probe-launching sound effects and EDI's voice in my head.  They should keep that music for movement within the galaxy console only.  They can use different music for the planet scans.  Sometimes, I do get sucked into the planet scanning experience, like others have said.  But that's only because of the great graphics and the basic lulling effect of the song.  But it's not worth it to annoy the fans with a lame minigame, and to ruin Uncharted Worlds.Final mission - The squad selection for certain parts was not obvious and kind of stupid.  Why wouldn't Mordin be good at navigating the tunnels in the Collector base?  He's billed as a salarian scientist genius who's great at surviving.  He should have been  a valid choice for this part.Load times - are generally pretty long and bad.  Switching disks - annoying, but it was so rare, I didn't really care.
Every fifty thousand years a race of sentient alien starships, the Reapers, scour the Milky Way of organic life for unknown reasons. The time of their return is at hand and the races of the Galaxy are not ready. It took the combined firepower of several entire fleets to destroy the first Reaper scout, Sovereign. In the process the Citadel - seat of the Galactic Council - was so badly damaged that repairs will take five years to complete.The Council believes the threat is over, and discounts reports that an entire fleet of hundreds of Reaper ships is lurking beyond the Galactic Rim. Their scepticism grows when Commander Shepard, the only human to know the true extent of the threat, is apparently KIA. But, two years later, Shepard resurfaces, now working for the Cerberus organisation outside the authority of Earth or the Council. Shepard now has the resources to carry the fight to the Reapers and starts by attacking one of their servant species, the Collectors, who have been raiding human colonies in the lawless Terminus Systems. But Shepard's allegiance with a borderline terrorist organisation threatens to alienate his former allies and undermines his attempts to expose the scale of the Reaper threat.Mass Effect 2, released in 2010, is the middle volume of a computer roleplaying trilogy. Unlike a lot of such series, which are normally developed ad hoc based on the sales of the previous game, the Mass Effect series was always envisaged as a trilogy with events building from one game to the next and culminating in an epic finale (to be seen in Mass Effect 3, released next month) which pits the entire Galaxy against the invading Reapers on a massive scale. Mass Effect 2 is therefore something of a bridging game, with a surprisingly small scope compared to the events of the first or third games (these things are relative, however, as ME2 still features ferocious firefights in alien starships dozens of miles long).The game's structure sees Shepard working for Cerberus and its shadowy founder, the Illusive Man (voiced with gravitas by Martin Sheen), an alliance of former foes (Cerberus is a side-enemy in the original Mass Effect) against the dual threat of the Collectors and the Reapers. The bulk of the game is set on the new starship Normandy SR-2, with Shepard choosing what assignment to undertake next. Early assignments revolve around building up a team of allies to help in the battle. The cast of the original Mass Effect has been scattered across the Galaxy and most are unavailable to help out in the new fight (though two of them do sign up and the rest show up in cameos), so Shepard is mostly reduced to forming a new team of dubious reliability and melding them into a cohesive unit. This is done by undertaking 'loyalty missions' for each character. Whilst optional, winning each character's loyalty pays dividends for the final mission - where unreliable or disloyal characters might die, or cause others' deaths - and hugely extends the playing time of the game (doing all of these missions results in Mass Effect 2 clocking in at about 25 hours, or twice the length of the original).This structure relies on the characters being compelling. Fortunately, Mass Effect 2 is the work of BioWare, who have created some of the most memorable characters in RPG history (and one of their most famous, Minsc from Baldur's Gate, gets a couple of hilarious shout-outs in ME2). There is a sense of early disgruntlement that most of the characters you got to know over the dozen or so hours of the original Mass Effect have been jettisoned, but this is soon overtaken by an interest in the new cast. BioWare have gone to some lengths to give each character their own motivation, personality and goals, backed up by strong voice acting and some excellent writing. There's some geek-friendly casting, with the likes of Yvonne Strahovski (Chuck), Michael Hogan (Battlestar Galactica), Robin Sachs (Babylon 5/Buffy the Vampire Slayer), Keith Szarabjka (Angel) and Tricia Helfer (Battlestar Galactica) providing voices, but all do great work. Keythe Farley deserves a special mention for his exceptional voicing of Thane Krios, the spiritual assassin dying of a terminal wasting disease.Gameplay-wise, Mass Effect 2 is an evolution - critics might call it a devolution - of the mechanics in the original game. Just as the original game downplayed some traditional RPG elements (such as inventory management) in favour of shooting, Mass Effect 2 takes this even further. Character advancement through levelling is streamlined considerably, with the removal of the original game's extensive skill tree in favour of a smaller, more combat-focused levelling mechanic, whilst the inventory has simply been removed completely. Inventory-less RPGs have been made before (such as the splendid Freedom Force superhero games) but it's still disconcerting to see in action. However, more careful examination of the game reveals that many of the same tangible effects of the inventory management of the first game (upgrades to weapons, grenades, armour and abilities) still exist, but have been transferred to the new research/upgrade system.This system employs a research lab which has been installed on the Normandy. Once Shepard has recruited a scientist, he can start researching upgrades to existing weaponry, armour and abilities, or unlock new weapons altogether. He can also upgrade the Normandy's capabilities. Again, this seems optional but it plays a major role in the game's finale (extending to some characters dying if the ship hasn't reached its maximum potential). Researching doesn't come for free and resources must be gathered from planets to fund it. This leads to a side mini-game where the Normandy orbits planets and scans them for resources, launching mining probes to recover them. This system can be slightly annoying (spending significant amounts of time mining when there's Collectors to be killed can be frustrating) but it's a much more intelligent use of resources than the original game (where they existed solely as an optional mission objective to make you look good).To the meat of the game, which is the in-mission view. There are two types of mission, 'hub' missions set on planets or space stations mostly inhabited by friendlies where Shepard has to resolve issues, typically through roleplaying. The game's intelligent dialogue system (slightly refined from the original game, with the addition of Paragon/Renegade actions you can undertake in addition to the simple speaking of dialogue) comes into its own here, with Shepard using diplomacy, threats or a mixture of the two to get a favourable outcome. However, far more commonplace are combat missions where Shepard and two allies have to fight their way through various enemies to achieve a mission objective.Combat is similar to the first game, in that it emphasis cover and directly shooting enemies rather than any kind of turn-based or pause-based combat, though you can still pause the game and bring up a tactical command menu, giving orders to your troops or employing special abilities yourself. It's been refined, with a more intelligent cover system (less sticking to a wall you just happen to brush up against) and the addition of area-based damage, such as headshots. Those looking for a more RPG style of combat may be disappointed by the directness of the battles, but at the same time those used to pure shooters like the Gears of War series may find the addition of dialogue options and a great degree of player freedom and choice to be liberating. BioWare are conflating the two genres here and doing so well, but RPG fans may feel that the game is a little imbalanced towards the shooter genre. Those who like both genres (like myself) will feel more at home with the game.Overall, Mass Effect 2 is a very strong game which emphasises player choice in the fields of characterisation and story development. What you, as Shepard, say or do in the game has enormous consequences, potentially leading to most of your crew being wiped out. Decisions also have important ramifications in Mass Effect 3, which may give players pause (for example, deciding the fate of a cure to the krogan plague or whether to pit the geth and Quarians into full-scale war has little impact in Mass Effect 2 itself, but will be major plot points in the final game). Complaints that the game is a dumbed-down RPG due to a streamlining of the gameplay systems are understandable, but the game also makes great strides forward in characterisation and the impact of player choice on personal interrelationships. This is a fascinating development in the way games handle characters and how relationships between them work, and shows how games can handle these factors in a way that films and novels cannot, an important evolution in the medium.Of course, those less interested in the title's place in gaming history can ignore all of that and get on with saving the Galaxy by laying waste to everything in sight with overwhelming firepower.Mass Effect 2 (****) is a very good game, with some excellent writing, memorable characters and strong combat sequences. The reducing of RPG elements in favour of shooter ones may offend RPG purists, but overall BioWare handle the merging of the two genres successfully. The game is available now in the UK (PC, X-Box 360, PlayStation 3) and USA (PC, X-Box 360, PlayStation 3). Mass Effect 3 is released on 6 March 2012 in the USA and three days later in the rest of the world.
I've divided this review into sections based on what I believe the most important elements of any RPG/Shooter video game are. As an honest prelude to the review, though, let me say that I meant to do this a while ago...but every time I had a moment free I wanted to actually play Mass Effect 2 instead. This game is incredibly good, and here's why:Main Storyline:The main storyline of Mass Effect 2 takes the player across a wide variety of missions with different purposes, environments, and enemies. However, I was extremely impressed with how cohesive everything seemed, even though the player retains a large degree of control over which missions to do and when. Not to spoil anything about the main storyline for prospective players, anyone who has seen one of the television commercials for the game knows that a large element of Mass Effect 2 is the need to "Assemble Your Team" to launch a potentially suicidal mission of galactic importance. Some missions focus on this, while others involve helping your new teammates with certain important tasks. In addition, from time to time, your character will be mandated to pursue a certain task at that very moment against the central enemies that serves to advance the course of the main storyline. This feature is actually very clever in that it ensures the player does not lose his/her focus on the central goal of the game's campaign, while also allowing a sense of order to be introduced in terms of tangible player benefits (see "Missions" section). Overall, again, without spoiling anything, the main storyline of Mass Effect 2 is well-thought, well-ordered, and highly interesting - you will be begging for Mass Effect 3 at the end. It is much more dramatic than that of the original Mass Effect and is laid out in such a way that a character is constantly engaged without getting lost in a sandbox of superfluous other missions.Main Storyline Ratings (out of 5 stars):Cohesiveness: 4.5 starsDrama: 5 starsEngaging: 5 starsOverall: 5 starsMissions:As previously mentioned, the missions of Mass Effect 2 are diverse and interesting. I have grouped all missions in Mass Effect 2 into four types: Central Storyline Missions, Teammate Missions, Loyalty Missions, and Independent Missions.Central Storyline Missions:These are missions that the player does not choose when they perform them, something slightly different from ME1. Essentially, every so often after the player has performed a certain number of teammate or loyalty missions, the player's "Handler" (the figure in RPGs who essentially tells the player what to do, such as Altair's master in Assassin's Creed 1 or the Council in the original Mass Effect) will call with a development concerning the central enemy of the storyline and a task that the player must perform immediately to respond. Surprisingly, this is not as annoying as some might think; in fact, I personally welcome these missions, for several reasons. First of all, the central storyline missions are one of the ways BioWare has managed to structure certain tangible player benefits, such as ensuring that a player gets a powerful new weapon at a certain time. Also, these missions are by far the most interesting and exciting, for two reasons: firstly, the storyline develops greatly over the course of these missions. The player learns more about the Mass Effect universe, the central enemy from Mass Effect 1, the Reapers (who still play a role in ME2 and will undoubtedly be the focus of ME3), and other important aspects of the exciting Mass Effect drama; and secondly, central storyline missions have the best gameplay of all the missions, in my opinion. The environments are diverse but all fascinating, the enemies are challenging, and they are generally longer overall and over the course of individual firefights.Teammate Missions:As previously mentioned, a number of missions throughout the game focus on the goal of assembling a team of the best, brightest, and deadliest individuals in the galaxy for a potentially suicidal mission. Teammate missions are the missions that the player must undertake to obtain the service of these individuals, usually by either helping them escape some sort of dire predicament or aiding them in completing their current task so they are free to join Commander Shepard and save the galaxy. These missions may be performed in an order that is more at the discretion of the player than central storyline missions; in short, you may choose to a large degree in what order you recruit your teammates (a useful feature if you have certain squadmates you like having in a battle - on a replay, you can acquire them first and have them around for a while). Once again, these missions are diverse, pitting the player and their current squad against a variety of enemies in a number of different environments and locations.Loyalty Missions:Following the acquisition of a new teammate, after a mission or two the player can initiate a loyalty mission with that teammate by talking to them about some person task or issue the teammate has. Inevitably, the player character Commander Shepard is asked to aid their crew member, and if you, the player, want the fun (and experience points and credits) you will. These missions are unique in that the player may only choose one member of his/her three-member squad (as opposed to the normal two) - the other spot is automatically designated for the teammate whose mission it is. This is actually a good opportunity for the player to experience all their squadmates' differing abilities and see which ones they like to have backing their character up. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, these missions are all quite different from each other in terms of environment and enemies. They also have the added RPG-element bonus of providing back-story or insight into the past, personality, or both, of the teammate character. These missions are roughly on par with teammate missions in terms of length and enjoyment (relatively high for both).Independent Missions:Independent missions round out the tasks the character can undertake in Mass Effect 2. They have nothing to do with the main storyline, although several of them have a two to three mission series that has its own central driving plot; some others are completely stand-alone. These missions can be activated usually through either talking to other people or characters in any of several population centers scattered across the galaxy or by scanning a planet and landing after detecting an anomaly. Independent Missions are quite short compared to any of the other types - some can be completed in 30 seconds, no joke. Others can take 5-10 minutes. They are fun, but not as much as other longer, more intense missions that have more purpose behind them. However, they're a nice distraction on occasion, and it's often fun to be able to find a brand new independent mission on one's second or third playthrough of the game (as has happened to me - I just completed the main storyline with my third character and on several occasions found new material in that playthrough).Missions Ratings (out of 5 stars):Challenging: 4-5 stars (depends on difficulty level and player skill)Replay Value: 4.5 starsVariety: 5 starsFun: 5 starsCharacter Development:This section discusses the non-tangible aspects of progressing through the game with a character (see "Character Advancement" for information about classes, skills, etc). One of the key features from Mass Effect 1 that has been replicated in one form or another in many RPGs, the Paragon/Renegade system, is still present in ME2, albeit with a few interesting changes (for the better, in my opinion). As before, the player can choose for their character to be a kind, charming individual (paragon) or a caustic, ruthless individual (renegade). However, in ME1 this only mattered for two things: getting the "Renegade" or "Paragon" Xbox 360 achievements, and how the player felt about their character. In ME2, the character's personality actually effectively replaces the skills of charm and intimidate - the degree to which a character is paragon or renegade determines in what situations they can use charm or intimidate conversation options (which are useful in avoiding unwanted encounters or getting discounts at stores, etc). Another returning character development option from ME1 is romance, which a character can undertake with one of their squadmates through periodic conversations. This has no tangible in-game benefits or detractions - it is purely a way of developing the personality of Commander Shepard (although the effects of an existing romance could be factored into Mass Effect 3 - who knows?). Overall, character development in Mass Effect 2, although not a central focus of the game, can definitely give the player a feeling of attachment to the Commander Shepard they create.Character Development Ratings (out of 5 stars):Realism: 4 starsSignificance: 4 starsContribution to Player Experience: 4 starsOverall: 4 starsCharacter Advancement:This section is devoted to discussing the actual elements of experience, classes, and skills. Overall, the improvement in this system over Mass Effect 1 is unbelievable. I find the classes in ME2 to be much more diverse in how they feel during combat - in fact, they are all so unique that I am on my fourth playthrough with a fourth class and have yet to feel bored. Before delving into the classes and their respective skills, a brief discussion on level advancement. Unlike ME1, where a character received XP (experience points) for every enemy they killed, XP is awarded in ME2 purely based on completing missions. Independent missions (see "Missions" section above) generally reward the character with 50 XP for non-combat missions to a couple hundred for slightly longer, combat-involving ones. In contrast to this, Teammate, Loyalty, and Central Storyline missions generally issue the player 1000 XP for completion. This serves to regulate player advancement to a degree that makes leveling up regular enough that the player isn't getting frustrated, rare enough that a player still gets excited, and still able to be affected by the player pursuing Independent missions. Leveling up is definitely a rarer phenomenon in ME2 than ME1: whereas in ME1 a player who performed a large number of the available missions could expect to be between level 40 and 50 upon completion, my first playthrough (namely, the one in which I did not have Long Service XP bonuses active - see "Game Features" section) resulted in only being level 25. In fact, there is a level cap at level 30 in ME2 (although whether this is enforced for importing an already-existing ME2 character to restart the main storyline, I am not sure - haven't tried it yet). That said, we now turn to classes and skills:There are the same 6 returning classes from ME1 in ME2: Soldier, Vanguard, Infiltrator, Sentinel, Adept, and Engineer. Each has its own role in terms of the game's three categories of abilities, which are combat, biotics (powers that center on things such as telekinesis and manipulation of matter), and tech (powers that center on the use of specialized equipment, such as cloaking or shooting bolts of superhot plasma). Soldier, Adept, and Engineer focus exclusively on combat, biotics, and tech, respectively, and hence each class is very good at that particular thing. Vanguard combines combat and biotics, Infiltrator combines combat and tech, and Sentinel combines biotics and tech. None of these three latter classes, though is as good in one of their two areas all-around as one of the former three - the classes are very well-balanced in my opinion. A few of the new features that further differentiate the classes and give them very unique playstyles are 1) weapon loadouts, and 2) class-specific powers. One of the main things that has changed between ME1 and ME2 is that, whereas in ME1 any class could use any weapon (some classes just did not include the option to improve on certain weapons), in ME2 your class DETERMINES what weapons you may use, period. Available weapons are: Sniper rifle, assault rifle, submachine gun, heavy pistol, shotgun, and heavy ordnance (the last one doesn't really count, though - Commander Shepard can ALWAYS use heavy ordnance, but no other squadmate can). Additionally, the submachine gun fills approximately the same role as the assault rifle - it is simply less accurate at range. I won't summarize the loadouts of all the classes, but as an example, while the Soldier can utilize sniper rifles, assault rifles, heavy pistols, AND shotguns, a sentinel gets stuck with just an SMG and heavy pistol (although he has many more offensive powers to back him up). As to class-specific powers: each class has a unique power that no other class has. Examples include the soldier's adrenaline rush (a power that effectively slows down time around the player, allowing them to spring to cover or line up that perfect headshot - see "Combat" section) or the Vanguard's biotic charge, which sends the player flying across a room or through cover to slam into an enemy (which can then immediately be followed with a melee and shotgun blast).Powers are improved through the use of squad points, which are awarded at 2 per level, except at level 11 (where you get 4) and levels over 20 (where you get 1). However, unlike ME1, where every rank only cost 1 squad point, there are only four ranks for each skill a player or one of their teammates possesses - but each rank requires squad points equal to its rank #. Thus, if a player playing an Infiltrator has the tactical cloak power filled through rank 3, they need 4 squad points to achieve rank 4. However, each rank is correspondingly more powerful, with rank 4 allowing the player to choose between one of two special (and usually pretty awesome) modifications or improvements to the ability. Finally, a player can even further differentiate a character through an option called "Advanced Training" that requires an investment of resources (see "Economic System" section) whereby they learn one of their loyal squadmates' unique powers.Character Advancement Ratings (out of 5 stars):Class Variety: 5 starsClass Functionality: 5 starsClass Balance: 5 starsRate of Advancement: 5 starsDegree of Customization: 5 starsOverall: 5 starsCombat:I am a fan of shooters. The first real video game I ever played was "Halo: Combat Evolved," and the Halo series along with Modern Warfare 2 compose my favorite video games. When I played my first real firefight in Mass Effect 2, I was thrilled at how much the combat system is improved over Mass Effect 1. Several things contribute to the combat improvements in ME2, which I've divided into categories: shooter features, squad system, and a concept I've termed "exploit tactics."By shooter features I am referring to concepts that are present in may pure first- and third-person shooters. One of the primary improvements over ME1 is (drumroll, please) HEADSHOT DAMAGE! Unlike ME1, headshots can make or break a battle for the player in ME2, especially with weapons such as any sniper rifle or heavy pistol or the Vindicator Battle Rifle (a burst-fire assault rifle). Secondly, the cover system in ME2 is greatly improved - some aspects of it remind me of Gears of War. The player can now actively choose whether or not to enter and exit cover by pressing "A" (for all you PC users out there, forgive my Xbox-specific controls), and can vault over low cover in a system nearly identical to GoW. Auto-aim for weapons seems to be slightly increased in ME2 from ME1 as well.Many features from ME1's already impressive squad system remain in ME2. The most useful features of the squad system in ME2, regardless of their presence or lack in ME1, are 1) the ability to combine squad powers (such as using "Throw" on an enemy after having a squadmate use "Pull" to increase its effectiveness), 2) the ability to manage squad members more specifically (ordering squadmates to attack different opponents or move to different locations), and 3) the ability to more accurately tailor or squad based on what you expect to encounter on a mission. Most notably about this last feature: whereas in ME1 you had 6 squad members to choose from, ME2 nearly doubles that to 11 ("This one goes to 11!"), with much more differentiability in weapon loadouts and powers among different squadmates; this serves to increase customization potential in any given squad for a mission by an enormous degree.Exploit Tactics is my way of referring to a profound feature of ME2 whereby specific defenses, enemies, and encounters can be met with different squadmates and powers more effectively and strategically. One key feature of this is a new category of powers called "Ammo Powers," whereby a squadmate increases the functionality of their weapon against a certain type of enemy (for instance, using disruptor rounds against shielded or synthetic enemies and incendiary rounds against armored or regenerating enemies like krogans). Also, certain biotic or tech powers get effectiveness bonuses against certain types of defenses (such as the warp power being able to tear through a biotic barrier or overload being highly effective against shields). This system makes the player think tactically about every encounter from the moment they are picking their squad to the last enemy.Overall, I cannot say enough good things about the combat system in ME2. It is fun, tactics are completely different based on class, and managing your squad actually matters, especially on the higher difficulty levels of Hardcore and Insanity.Combat Ratings (out of 5 stars):Shooter Elements: 5 starsCombat Intensity: 4-5 stars (depends on difficulty)Challenge: 3-5 stars (depends on difficulty and player skill)Squad System: 4.5 starsOverall: 5 starsEconomic System:The way a player deals with equipment, items, credits (money) and the new addition of resources is, once again, a vast improvement in Mass Effect 2 over ME1. First of all, gone are the endless numbers of superfluous upgrades that one must constantly sell or omni-gel - in fact, omni-gel conversion is no longer a feature in ME2 (which I believe to be a relieving change, since having to spend 10 minutes repeatedly pressing "Y" to omni-gel my endless list of useless upgrades and weapons after maxing out credits was extremely annoying in ME1). Equipment such as upgrades and items are now NEVER a bad thing in ME2. New items (namely, weapons) are actually quite rare in ME2, but when you get them, you definitely know it. A new weapon is a special occasion in ME2, and the player retains the ability to select the weapon loadout of all their squadmates (restricted by their the weapons they can use, of course). The game is nice enough to automatically upgrade all applicable squadmates to the new weapon for you though (assuming your like the new one better, which is usually the case). Getting new weapons, thus, is not the usual means of being able to dish out more damage in combat in ME2. Instead, the player is constantly buying or researching upgrades that apply bonuses either to specific squadmates' abilities, Commander Shepard alone, or the entire squad. These upgrades do everything from increasing medi-gel capacity (medi-gel being now a component of the Unity power), increasing power damage and duration, increasing health or shields, or upping damage for certain types of weapons for the entire squad. Upgrades, as mentioned, can be bought, which uses credits, or researched, which requires one of four types of resources that are found by actively scanning remote planets (unlike ME1, where the system was: go to planet X, press Y, oh, you found some platinum, get 3000 credits). The resources you find by scanning (which itself is more complicated than pressing "Y" now) are actually directly useful. Credits also are more rare in ME2 (no more bank accounts reading 9,999,999 like you diehard ME1 players are all too familiar with), and are found by the player through hacking, bypassing safes, etc, in a system far surpasses ME1's in variety and complexity, as well as being issued to a player for completion of missions of all types. You never sell one item in ME2. Overall, I believe the economic system in ME2 makes a player value and prioritize money to a greater degree than ME1, as well as introducing a whole new tier with research and resources that fleshes out the experience quite a bit.Economic System Ratings:Complexity: 4.5 starsPlayer Prioritization: 4.5 starsEquipment System: 5 starsOverall: 4.5 starsFinal Comments:This game is a phenomenal RPG/shooter, one of the best, with massive replay value. I absolutely cannot wait for Mass Effect 3.Also, I know this was a long review - mine tend to be that way. I commend those of you who read the entire thing, and I hope you got some good information out of it.

The Mass Effect series has an outstanding story, fueled by one helluva writer: Drew Karpyshyn.  If you're new to the Mass Effect universe, I must strongly recommend that you go and buy Mass Effect 1, Mass Effect: Revelation, and Mass Effect: Ascension.  Once you've got them all in your possession, play through Mass Effect.  It's not mandatory that you do many of the side quests, if at all, ANY of them, since the vast majority of them have no real bearing on the story in Mass Effect 2 (that I've noticed).  Once you've finished Mass Effect, read the books; Revelation first, then Ascension.  Then, and only then, can you go on and play Mass Effect 2, milking it of the full experience.That being said, Mass Effect 2 isn't gonna interest you at all if you're buying it for the combat system.  It just isn't.  I've heard so many people complaining about the various things that've gimped Mass Effect 2 over the original, and to them, they're valid complaints.  To me, however, removing some of the more in-depth features like weapon and armor upgrades just made it that much easier to focus on the story at hand.  And in the end, that's what Mass Effect is.A beautiful, well-told story that evolves and changes depending on choices--even the "small ones"--that you make throughout your playthrough.Before going on to anything else, I want to make it perfectly clear that those decisions you made earlier on in Mass Effect (small or otherwise) do show up to great you in one form or another here in the second episode.  What's more, even though it'd been a year or so since I last actually picked up Mass Effect, I remembered these characters and situations.  For example...* * * SPOILER ALERT * * ** Depending on whether or not you kill Fist in the first game, he'll show up to berate you in the Bar on Omega.  My first playthrough (and consequently, my first playthrough in Mass Effect 2), I let him live.  He didn't see it as such a kind gesture, and I immediately started wondering why I actually let him go.  Prolly due to the fact that the only reason he was killed in my second playthrough was due to having Wrex in my group.* On Virmire, once you've handled Benezia, you can kill or set free the Rachni Queen.  In all my playthroughs of Mass Effect, I could never bring myself to kill her.  She didn't seem like the threat that Wrex made her out to be, and... 's just not in me.  So I set her free, and ever since then, I'd been looking forward to seeing how they fit into Mass Effect 2.  Sadly, the only time the Rachni even surface in Mass Effect 2 is on Ilium, in the form of a memory embedded in a random Asari.  You were told that when your encounter with the Collectors came to a close, the Rachni's song would be... I dunno, something or other.  Needless to say, I didn't see any evidence of further Rachni interaction through the rest of the game.  Left me feeling a bit... empty.* By default (for me at least), a new character made from scratch with no imported save (which I was forced to do, as I had no saves compatible for import) will have the following choices applied: you focused your attacks on Sovereign at the cost of the Council being eliminated, you sacrificed Kaidan Alenko to save Ashley Williams, and Udina was chosen to be the human representative to the Citadel.  Interestingly enough, these were the exact OPPOSITES of what I'd chosen on every playthrough I ever made.  I was always pro-alien, anti-Ashley, and anti-Udina.  So to have the game go and make the exact opposite choices was... amusing, at best.* * * SPOILER ALERT * * *There are various other changes that BioWare's made to the game, for better or for worse.  They've removed random planet scouting with the Mako (and OH MY GOD I'M GLAD THEY DITCHED THE MAKO), replacing that with a mini-game of sorts, in the way of planet-scanning for minerals.  Scanning for these minerals is the sole way to upgrade your ship, as well as personnel upgrades, so it's necessary (later becoming a necessary EVIL, once it's lost its novelty).The introduction of Renegade/Paragon maneuvers during certain cutscenes have introduced yet another level of dynamic storytelling into the mix.  Though you're usually given a good few seconds to intervene, if you're not quick enough, you could end up having to live with some painful consequences.Interestingly enough, a coworker made a remark to me that actually makes a lot of sense: "Mass Effect 2 teaches me more about ethics than [this book] ever will."And that's true.Whereas the original Mass Effect was peppered with various decisions that you had to make, difficult or otherwise, Mass Effect 2 is designed in such a way that those decisions are significantly more difficult to make.  In general, I had made my selection on the dialog wheel well before the subtitles appeared on screen, making for a more fluid dialog exchange.  By the end of ME2, I was taking longer and longer to make the decisions that affected my team, because they were becoming... well, IMPORTANT to me.  Familial, perhaps.That being said, the superficial stuff also matches the story.Graphics are 5/5.  Texture popping isn't nearly as prevalent (if at all visible) as it was in the first.Audio is 5/5.  Love the score for this game as much as I did for the original.  Gonna buy the soundtrack eventually; only been putting it off because I was convincing myself that they were gonna release an actual hard copy on disc eventually.Gameplay is 5/5.  There was one instance where I managed to get myself stuck in the ceiling on the Citadel somehow, but I was unable to recreate it, so that's not really an issue.  As has been said, the long elevator rides have been replaced with loading screens.  In a humorous nod to that, very early on in the story, you're specifically told to, and I quote, "Take an elevator down one level."  And sure enough, the one-level trip takes the time you'd think it would.  Armor types have been eliminated: any class can wear all armor.  Specific slotted upgrades have been eliminated.  Traditional health readouts have been eliminated.  Again: MAKO HAS BEEN ELIMINATED (huzzah!).  I'm sure there are other changes that've been made that I'm forgetting, but... these are the major ones, I think.

Hi Everyone!I just recieved this as a early Easter gift from my hubby :)  {He bought thihs on Amazon,from a Amazon commited seller} I have been a Spyro fan since his 1st appearance years,years ago.I haven't played any of his games since,well,7-9 yrs? Naw,it may not be all that long,but it has been ages! My last Spyro game I played,was "Hero Tail" on ps2,it was my last game with Spyro,basically because I didn't like the way it turned in his series.Taking out the gem collecting I fell in love with,and side kicks ways as they taught him things,and MONEY BAGS,really bummed me out.As our children grew up,finished schooling,moved out,well,I pulled away from gaming~and just starting to rediscover gaming once again on gaming systems,and on my new laptop.So,when my hubby handed me several Easter wrapped packages-I was shocked~surprised to see this game,practically PRISTINE condition! I was doing kart wheels and sommersaults and whooping it up!!{ok,ok,ok..I was doing those in my head~if I attempted to do them now I'd be typing this from a hospital bed! heh heh heh}....So,after hugging and smothering my hubby to death,and making him his favorite snack{stack of pancakes buttered and smothered with warm Vermont Maple Syrup},I opened up the case,shaking hands,looked at the blue disc,extremely pleased it's flawless,I popped into gaming system....Boy,hearing old but familiar Spyro gaming sounds,watching it go through it's demos,it brought back memories of playing this when our children were home,and we ALL competed to see who got 100% 1st,and figured out any secrets per level! It all came back in a rush :) I actually called up our grown children,babbling like a mom who just got the greatest gift ever,my hubby actually had to take my cellphone,and reassure them all,I did NOT win the lottery drawing,but,instead,recieved an old friend as a early Easter gift.This is a great game from beginning to,well,I'd say end~but I'm still playing it :) The colors,sounds of this game,are fantastic! Playing him on a huge flat screen is even BETTER than the 1st time I played this game,on a old 19"rca color tv{it had no remote control,and was big bulky back that weighed a ton!}I noticed that I have slightly forgotten this game,and Spyro unique moves,but having a blast reenjoying an old forgotten friend.In fact,our children are already begging{2 even bribed dear old dad,in attempt to getting this game to play 1st,when I am done with it! the other one,tried to bribe me with a pogo game~very tempting let me tell you! heh heh heh heh....}.Whether your an old friend of Spyro,or a new friend discovering Spyro,you will love this game! It has a lot of action,and plenty of quests,and will keep you and your loved ones busy for weeks.Well,I have other early Easter gifts to open still,and a Spyro game to play...Happy Early Easter Greetings to you all :)P.S.~ I do advise setting game play time settings,as hours an hours,will go by before you realize it,and your hubby/wife will be in bed snoring away!! Also,have plenty of popcorn on hand-it goes great with this game,and makes a great bribe to a certain puppy{in my case a dauschund puppy},who thinks Spyro on tv is something to bark an chase after! :) :)

Hookers, UZI's, MAFIA, Eminem trash talkMix and what do you got- GTA 3.First of all this game is a great game in its own sort of way.I bought this game a little bit after it came out, just to see if it was as great as everybody said it was. I WASN'T DISSAPPOINTED. The game is great. The realism makes you wonder. But there ain't nothing like hearing an old lady cuss at you when you throw her out of her own... car. I mean to be honest I didn't buy this for the highly controversial bonus side, but instead for the amazingly fun missions that I experienced in GTA and GTA2. But in 3d. I mean I buy games just for their story. I must say though don't let younger gamers get a hold of this. I am a teenager gamer. But even though I won't play this in front of my mom, this game is a must-buy. It has my brother, younger sister, and even Dad hooked on it, just like Hooked On Phonics. If you want to just play the game you don't have to experience the negativity. For example, all my Dad does is drive the tank around and go on police chases. So, the game is only bad if you want it to be bad. But this game is great. I beat all the missions at 38percent. But I still come back for more. Do a 100 taxi missions, you get a new taxi. Find all the hidden packages you get weapons at garage for every ten. So, you can always play it for more. To wrap it up the game is for the mature at heart. Not the young kids who play it just for the abrasive trash-talk.Not for the older people who have difficulty with the missions. This comment is not bias or anything like that. But all the older that I've talked to say the missions are difficult. The hardest mission I did was stealing nice cars and driving them across town in 5:00 minutes without a scratch on them. I would just recommend playing the game before you buy it. So, you know that its for you.

I went through my old Video games, weeding out those destined for trade in at Bookman's.  I saw this one and remembered liking it, so I threw it back in and played it through.  I forgot how much fun this game was and highly recommend a re-try to those FPS freak out there.  I mean, you can get this game dirt cheap now, and it is a total blast!!!My only beef is, you have to play it through in order to use the cheat available and many of us play a game once and that's it.Other than that, not a single complaint.  This game freaking rocks!  Tons of different monsters/foes, tons of cool weapons, level upon level of varying backgrounds.  Too me back to the old days of all the Doom games.So, if you're feeling nostalgic and want to play an FSP that doesn't require you to evolve three extra fingers on each hand, dig this one back up or buy it dirt cheap here on Amazon.  You won't regret it.

The last Madden game I bought was 07' for the wii.  It was a workout to play, but fun.  In Madden 09' for the xbox 360 there is so much to do that it can give you a feeling of "where do I start?"  For die hard Madden fans they will feel right at home as it feels like the same game with better graphics.  The game play has a learning curve for those of us who just like to sit down and play a game with there favorite team, but, if you head on over to the online play you start with 0.00 points.  You need to play a match online to gaine more points to level up, what dose leveling up mean? I have no Idea as I get whacked each time I play a ranked match. Also, if you quit a game early, you get a percentage of DNF (did not finish) and that can be bad if you try to play a ranked match and no one wants to play with you if you have a 30 percent quit DNF raiting.  So, even if you are getting drilled by every team you play online, you will have to suck it up and finish the match, most players seem not to mind or worrie about the DFN percentage though.My score:Graphics 9/10Game play 7/10Online 8/10Difficulty Medium-HardOverall  7.9/10There still has not been a football game on the market that feels great, plays great, looks great and is fun for beginners and die-hard fans alike.
this review is just for the vita and not the ps3I went to gamestop to pick up my copy of ps3 the show for the vita, and i am really happy with it. It is everything you expect from the show plus more. they have everything from making the game so easy to making it so hard. everyone who is a fan of baseball should pick this game up. the only complaint i have is my online pass didnt work, but that does not reflect my game review because it isnt part of the game. the gameplay is so smooth and you feel a sence of accomplishment when you blast a home-run. they brought back where you can choose exactly where you swing and that is what i am talking about. This game feels just as smooth as when i played mlb 08 and mlb 11 on the ps3. playing on the vita doesnt take nothing away from the experience.editedMy online pass worked later that night when i got the game. i guesss they were having problems.I played a couple games online and the experience was fun, but also frustrating. It seems like a lot of people either disconnect or quit once you get the lead. I have played 3 full games and my record is 5-4. people are getting losses when they havnt even played. The timing for hitting is rediculous online. It seems like your always either late or early. If you hit a hard ground ball to right field it is so easy to get thrown out at first. sometimes the catcher will get stuck on a 3rd strike pass ball or a steel and who ever is running can run the bases and get a free run. If you really care about your record or play seriously then i suggest you wait for a patch to jump online. If you play for fun like me and could care less about your record, you can still have fun playing online right now.i chaned it to 4 stars overall because of all the problems online. if you buying this to play mainly online i suggest you wait to pick it up.online 3 starsoffline 5 stars. If you buying this game to play mainly offline i suggest you pick it up right now
Well this game is great I played it for months and was the reason I baught a PS2. But now its old and I ahve other games to play, the reason it got old I thought though was that it didn't have enough storyline. I finished the story and got kinda bored of lookign for hidden packages and rampages and whatnot. I would rahter be told to kill this or that guy and steal this than jsut randomly doing it.Ok enough of the bad this game has good graphics, and some great stories and lots of neat cars to drive. Lovely wreaks and movement of cars as well. Sometimes other cars jsut driving along will go crazy and run from you, some peopel you pull out of there cars shoot or try to beat you up. Its got such a great choas factor in it. I do wish they would of added a two player mode though I fell they could have easily.
Well this game is great I played it for months and was the reason I baught a PS2. But now its old and I ahve other games to play, the reason it got old I thought though was that it didn't have enough storyline.

If you're a fan of tactical RPGs, a PSP owner, or a fan of RPGs in general it'd truly be heresy to pass on Jeanne d'Arc. Even if you're unfamiliar with tactical RPGs but would like to get into the genre, Jeanne d'Arc is an excellent place to start. The game presents itself as a 30 hour minimum tactical RPG with a charming storyline, a memorable cast of characters, amazing voice-acting, and a nearly flawless battle/skill system. Even after completing the main storyline, the game has much more to offer - including tougher enemies on free stages, ultimate weapons/skills, and a set of the hardest battles which the game has to offer. "Jeanne" was so good, that not only did I clock in at 58 hours of gameplay, but I was so sad the game was coming to an end. Indeed, Jeanne d'Arc passes itself as easily the best PSP tactical RPG and also manages to hold its own ground next to the giants defining the genre, such as Fire Emblem, Vandal Hearts, Shining Force, and yes, Final Fantasy Tactics. Though the game does have a few flaws, such as having a very easy difficulty, and long skill dialog during battle (explained under Battle System.)I'd just like to say that the engine this game uses is nearly PERFECT. Load times are fast, everything is just really smooth and I don't know if I'll be able to adjust to other TRPGs after playing one that was so perfect. *Looks menacingly at Eternal Poison's 5 second white screens EVERY TIME you tried to attack an enemy*Quick Review:Story/Character Presentation Total Score: 19/20Gameplay Mechanics Total Score: 44/50Graphics, Sounds, and Controls Total Score: 28/30Total Score: 91/100, Near Perfect!Story/Character PresentationStory/Plot 9/10Very rarely does a tactical RPG hold a memorable storyline with intense emotional moments and plot twists. Well, Jeanne d'Arc does exactly that; many rivalries are built throughout the course of the game and hold true until the last few battles. This is not one of those elementary RPGs whose ultimate boss is someone who was never heard of until the last hour of gameplay - the final showdown will be one that's been building for 30 hours. Not a single question is left unanswered and the plot flows beautifully with never a dull moment. I was expecting to pick this game up and find a solid game play, instead I picked it up and found one of the most incredible plot/storylines I've ever had.Cast 10/10Quite frankly, I never saw a game that was designed so perfectly when it comes to the cast. The only other game I know of that allowed so much freedom was Final Fantasy VI. I encouraged a few other people to play, and not one of them used an identical set of characters. A few of them are underpowered and I admit I didn't use 3-4 of the characters, but I know if I had leveled them up high enough they'd have been effective. Each character also has a decent amount of development, and having a large group of well-trained characters is crucial. At times, you can (and sometimes need to) take 9 characters into a single battle, though generally it's 4-6.Story/Character Presentation Total Score: 19/20Gameplay MechanicsSkill System 9/10Skills in Jeanne d'Arc are probably the most crucial thing in the game, more so than improved weapons and armour. Not only can they be very powerful, but at times even feel like "cheating." They offer passive abilities (like +attack, +accuracy, HP recovery, +max HP), passive abilities specific to classes (Such as "Desperation" which lowers an axeman's defense but improves their attack), in-battle magic (Can be used by anyone), and class-specific magic. The one problem with the skill system is that the passive skills seem to be way too powerful. For instance, a HP recovery IV will heal 30% of a character's health while a HP +150 increases most character's hitpoints by 20-40% even later on. While both of these are high level abilities and crucial for post-game bonuses, they incredibly overpower your team and result in near immortality except for defenseless character like archers and mages.Because passive skills are so powerful and you are limited in the number of skill slots, most of the true beauties like skills costing MP become irrelevant. For instance, archers have a poison attack, recovery attack, ultimate attack, etc., but in order to keep archers a relevant part of battle you basically need HP Recovery, HP+, Attack+, Mobility +, and Range+. This essentially leaves 1 spot for a "spell" type attack. Though don't worry, most classes' single skill attack will do enough damage.As for obtaining skills? This isn't at all difficult - but a major problem I'll be addressing in the Battle System. Early on in the game obtaining skills are as easy as killing an enemy. When they die, they randomly drop whatever skills they have. Sometimes you'll be lucky and get all 3-5 skills they have, sometimes they wont drop a single one. Later on you get a thief who can steal skills, which is ABSOLUTELY crucial, but this creates another problem I'll address in the battle system. For instance, one skill increases mobility and for "tanks" with low ability this skill makes them INCREDIBLY powerful - without it the "tank" is almost always 2-3 squares behind the action. The interesting thing about the skill system is the ability to combine skills. I wont spoil any of the combinations, but skill combining is basically mass experimentation. Luckily, after you combine skills it saves itself in the formula book so you don't have to write them down for yourself.Battle System 28/30Ah yes, the most important aspect of a tactical RPG. Let me start off by saying that the game has an optional built in rock/paper/scissors type of combat, much like Fire Emblem. Instead of weapon powers/weaknesses, Jeanne d'Arc instead uses a crude astrological system - Son, Luna, and Stella, or sun, moon, and the stars. Facing someone who is weak to your symbol (that you can change at ANY time outside of battle or during the prep before battle) will result in much heavier damage, if it's the opposite (they're strong against your symbol) you do significantly less damage. Personally, I thought the game could've been much better had it been mandatory - but regardless I was not disappointed. Abusing these "signs" was quite easy, as I mentioned you have a preparation period before battle, and during this time you can examine all of the enemies skills. Therefore, you could easily load your characters up with the correct symbols accordingly or even opt to not use them at all.Another interesting concept which is, for the most part, optional until the Colosseum bonus battles, are "Burning Auras." After you attack an enemy with a basic, non-skill attack, directly across from you a "Burning Aura" is made. From my experience, enemies can not take advantage of them, but when your characters use them they'll generally attack with a strike so devastating that it'll kill most enemies in a single shot. These also can become more "saturated" (through the use of ranged spear attacks) for even more powerful attacks. While auras are good for offense, and not exactly crucial, defensive "walls" as I like to call them are even more important. As long as you keep all of your allies beside each other (including diagonally) you gain a vastly increased defense. In matter of fact, in many cases this can make enemies attacks worthless.And finally, the highlight of Jeanne d'Arc is what I like to call "god-mode." Some of your cast members can "transform" into another form using "bracelets." They receive super stats and also get to take a second turn if they successfully kill an enemy, therefore you can strategically "chain" kills and potentially kill every enemy in a single turn. The game becomes so easy near the end that generally you can kill most of the enemies before you even have the required AP (similar to MP) to transform into another form. But on the incredibly difficult battles, it's very possible to transform multiple times in a single battle.Now for the bad - the game loses a few points for the following problems with the battle system. As I mentioned earlier, you have an ability called "HP Recovery" which is incredibly important later on and makes magicians basically useless. At the beginning of every turn the game cycles through an "order of operations" for all of your characters, which goes HP Recovery > Poison > Revert Transformations. If you have all your characters using HP Recovery and all of them get damaged during their turn, it'll cycle through every character prompting the heal. Doesn't sound like a big deal but it gets ANNOYING after 30 hours of gameplay! Additionally, poison will then do more damage so next turn you'll be suffering the same fate. One enemy does an area-poison attack - yippie. With 6 party members, that's 24 clicks of X over a two turn period to cancel that poison out.The other flaw of the game (this may be why I got so overpowered though!) is that if you attempt to steal gems from enemies it can take A LOT of time. Generally, I could make it to the stages boss in 4-6 rounds. Then I'd literally just box the boss in and continually steal (you can steal infinite time - until the turn limit is met) until I got however many of a gem I wanted or just accepted the few I got. Sometimes these gems are skills such as Experience Bonus III, which increases your experience by 250-300%, but in turn are rare to steal. Not wanting to pass up on these, I recall going through 45-60 minutes just attempting to steal these and then resetting if I didn't get the desired skills. Ouch. Since you can never repeat the original stage of enemies (most stages turn to "free stages" with different enemies and no bosses after the battle) you must reset if you want the desired skill.As for the turn limit? Many people complained about it, but I don't think it's a big deal at all. There were only two times I nearly failed to meet the turn limit, once was on the final final final bonus battle, the other was on my first escape scene which I thought only one person needed to escape - all 7 needed to! The turn limit certainly would make stealing less of a pain, but I don't think you're meant to steal 10 experience bonus III's. :)Also another few minor things I didn't feel the need to go into depth about: grinding is never necessary during the main storyline. "Catching up" a character is easy too, as a low level beating a high level could easily net hundreds of experience even later on in the game (I gained 630 experience from a single attack and nearly 20 levels from a single battle with Experience Bonus IV). To beat the bonus stage, having your party on level 99 is very helpful, and even then the battle will be difficult. In maybe 45 minutes to an hour I was able to max my whole final party out. Not bad at all!Those who feel like quitting after beating the final stage - DONT! The most difficult and exciting battles are ahead of you in the Colosseum. If you want to get the most out of the game, DEFINITELY beat at least the 2nd round of the Colosseum!Difficulty 7/10The game loses a few points here because of it's easiness, but in turn is amazing for people just getting into the genre. As I've stated before, the Colosseum battles are very difficult (mainly rounds 8, 9, and 10), but besides that the whole game is a breeze. Because of the increased defense from having your allies next to each other, burning auras, astrological alignments, and very powerful archers early on there's never really a hard part. The first 5-7 hours are probably the most difficult - I didn't die once as a party, and only on a few occasions did individual party members die. The most exciting part of the game (and rewarding!) was defeating the final round in the Colosseum and coming back to win after my party was reduced to only my healer with all enemies still alive (Yay for revive.)Gameplay Mechanics Total Score: 44/50Graphics, Sounds, and ControlsGraphics 8/10Jeanne d'Arc does not have the PSP's best graphics, but they do well for the game and I can't really complain about them. They 3D and they are colourful, but with certain filters, such as a fog filter, the game can give off an eerie feel at times. Each level (I believe there's around 40) is a completely new environment, there's a mass amount of texures, and they definitely paid attention to detail. Some are inside fortresses, some are in sewers, some are on mountains, some in swamps, some in forests. Another nice thing about Jeanne d'Arc is the cut scenes. Like Final Fantasy Tactics, upon entering a stage characters would automatically walk around talking to each other, but during those really *special* scenes a beautifully done anime video would play. I'm not huge on anime, but it was a nice touch. I gave Jeanne an 8/10 for graphics, because even though they are beautiful it'd feel like a crime to grant both Jeanne and Crisis Core a 10/10 for graphics!Controls/Menus/Camera: 10/10Not much to say here, almost everything is perfect. Fully rotatable camera angle, which makes me :)Music/Voice Acting: 10/10This is another one of the small details that make it amazing. While the soundtrack isn't anything memorable, the voice acting is so amazing that I am for once glad a Japanese game has English/French voice actors. Each actor speaks with a beautiful French accent which greatly adds to the game.Graphics, Sounds, and Controls Total Score: 28/30Total Score: 91/100I don't believe in perfect and note that I rated my favorite game of all time (Final Fantasy VI) a 96/100. Therefore, a 91/100 is incredible!JUST REMEMBER:-Pay attention to the story! I didn't early on because of it being a tactical RPG and it literally pulled me in because of how good it was.-SAVE OFTEN, and make duplicate saves. If you join a battle, prepare your skills, then save over the game and realize there's a level 70 dragon you can't possibly beat your game is LOST FOREVER.-[Minor spoiler]At one point in the game you are given two different "paths" to choose. The only difference is the character you receive, one of which is a second thief who can steal skills. Pick that one! Unfortunately, you can't get the other character even in post-game :(-[Minor spoiler]Don't do the first Colosseum until AFTER you receive a "purple character." I don't want to spoil much, but if you do it before then you'll fail to get a cool item.-[Minor spoiler]If you fail to collect the hidden items on the bonus stage "Cemetery" you'll never have a chance to get them later. These items include very powerful weapons/skills. Also pay attention to round 7 of the Colosseum #3 for more bonus items!-To get the most out of the game, play the final two rounds of the Colosseum! It's about 3-4 more hours of game play, including the most difficult battles you'll ever encounter. If you lose you have to start over from round 1.Once again! Total Score: 91/100
Pros:+Gorgeous Graphics with some great anime cutscenes+An engrossing storyline+Really loveable characters+Easy to become acquainted with+Surprisingly large amount of customizationCons:-For those looking for innovation they won't find itThe PSP has slowly been gaining a lot of RPGs and tactical RPGs.  In late 2007 we saw the release of three Strategy RPGs in particular.  Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions, Disgaea: Afternoon of Darkness and Jeanne D'arc.  While Final Fantasy Tactics and Disgaea were two fine ports from two fine systems, Jeanne D'arc stands on its own as an original creation.  The result is a beautiful, simple SRPG that while it doesn't change the face of the genre, it's a game that manages to be fun nonetheless.The story of Joan of Arc has been told numerous times.  However, it's never quite been told like this.  That is to say the story itself mixes in Fantasy with History.  In short, any student hoping to use this game has an interactive history lesson won't find it.  On the other hand, though, the story is well told through some fantastic Anime cutscenes that are by far some of the best to grace the PSP thus far.  There are some great characters to accompany you on your travels as well.  It also helps that the game has some spectacular voice acting with French accents that aren't overdone, but aren't too tame either.  The cel shaded graphics looks absolutely astonishing as well.  The environments are enormous and detailed.  The enemies are also pretty detailed as well.  In terms of production values, Jeanne D'arc exceeds by being both artistic, and showing what the PSP is capable of doing.  It's very rare when a game does both very well, but Jeanne D'arc does.A beautiful game can't stand alone without some good gameplay to go along with it.  Luckily, Jeanne D'arc has some good gameplay too.  It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but the simplicity of the game makes it so that there is no need for overly long tutorials that plague a few other tactical RPGs.  While this can be a little annoying for those who dwelled into more complex SRPGs such as Final Fantasy Tactics and Disgaea, it does have a few traits that make it overall fun to play.  As usual, you'll control characters on a grid and there are a set of objectives.  In some missions the goal is to defeat the enemy leader while making sure a specific character doesn't fall.  In other missions it's simply to crush all the bad guys.  The game adds a twist on this as well.  You must finish the battle in a certain amount of turns or its game over.  While this is a nice twist it's hardly something that merits being included.  You'll finish most battles long before you get that warning telling you how many turns are left.Much like other SRPGs you'll have a set of commands to attack your enemies and use skills.  Unlike many SRPGs, though, the counter attack rate in Jeanne D'arc is through the roof.  The good news is that this makes the battles go faster. That may be one of the things that helps this game out.  In many SRPGs battles are slow winded and last for a long time.  In Jeanne D'arc they go relatively fast.  In between turns you'll also see enemies and allies shout things out.  For a moment this is alright, after a while it gets annoying.There are skills at work in battle.  You can equip certain skill stones to let you do things like cast healing spells or perform special attacks in battle.  Equipping skill stones doesn't just grant you abilities or status enhancements.  It's also there to raise affinity with the three spirits, Luna, Sol and Stella.  There is no one spirit greater or more powerful than another.  This works in a Rock-Paper-Scissors, fashion.  One spirit is stronger than one but weak against the other.  This puts a lot more emphasis on strategy.  Some attacks deal far more damage based on which spirit you are affiliated with.  The same thing works for your enemies.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Jeanne D'arc is that the games transformation system.  Jeanne can transform once she has enough SP.  This gives her a significant boost to her stats.  It also gives her the ability to take another turn immediately after killing an enemy.  This is great, but because of the increase in stats in some areas it makes the game unreasonably easy.  That doesn't mean the entire game itself is easy.  You'll find that in many maps you're outnumbered.  And that a mishap or two in your strategy can cost you the battle.  Jeanne D'arc may be a simple game to learn but it can be a bit tough to master.Jeanne D'arc also sounds masterful.  The soundtrack is beautifully orchestrated.  While at some points the music can be repetitive (particularly hearing the "Enemy Phase" music over and over again), it still sounds absolutely fantastic.  If there was anything holding Jeanne D'arc back, it would be the games lack of voice acting.  While you hear a lot in the animated scenes, you don't hear them that much beyond that.  It'd be nice if some of their battle callouts, for example, were screamed out.  This is a minor problem and in no way detracts from the game itself, though.Any PSP owner looking for a fun, engrossing SRPG ought to look to Jeanne D'arc.  It's incredible story, simple battle system and good use of customization and balance make it an engrossing adventure.  It may not reinvent the wheel, but that keeps the game from being a needlessly complicated endeavor.
Graphics-It's no surprise by looking at numerous videos and screen-captures of this game that it's a far cry from cutting edge.  The overall technical level of the graphics is either showing its age or they took a hit by having such expansive and large set pieces and characters.  That isn't to say they're awful though.  Each individual looking at this game will likely have to evaluate what they demand in terms of graphics from a game.  I personally would call them passable because while they aren't astonishing the locations of the game are interesting to look at and the enemies and characters you'll meet are appropriate to their settings and fun.  Character and attack animations while mostly understated still manage to be engaging and entertaining with spells being the most impressive of the bunch.Sound-The music thus far has been strictly average.  At times I feel as though I have a pack of bards tailing me because the majority of the songs I've heard having that kind of simple village music sound to them, flutes with little boisterous drive to get the blood boiling.  The voice overs aren't too bad, none of the characters are particularly irritating in cut scenes or battles but the timing does suffer from the typical Japanese to English dub syncing issues.  Overall I'd say everything works on a functional level but it does little inspire the player like a very good score sometimes can.Combat-Battles play out with a bit of a blend between turn based RPG standards with a touch of MMORPG.  Before battles you can set up action bars by placing acquired skills in to slots.  During a fight you will have a circular timer count up and when full you can select an action from your preselected set to use.  At the very start of the game it seems painfully slow due to few options for skills and the likelihood that you don't fully understand how the system works.  As you get more attacks, build combos, and balance your load-out to your liking though it becomes much more enjoyable.  One could for example play a mage with little to no armor wielding a dagger and they'd get turns much faster than a heavily armored melee fighter but the obvious trade off is that they become a bit of a glass cannon by trading defense for speed.  I think there's a lot of not so obvious depth to the combat which makes it rather enjoyable for me.  Granted it isn't a system everybody will enjoy and criticisms against it I feel have been fair from reading other reviews.Enemies-The enemies themselves seem to come in two flavors, big and small.  Small enemies are pretty much what you would expect, find what hurts them and hurt them with it.  Collect your spoils, wash, rinse, repeat.  The bigger enemies however are much more fun to fight and offer more nuanced ways of defeating them.  Early on you'll be fighting trolls for example.  Trolls have 4 targetable zones, their 2 legs, the belly, and their head.  You can defeat the enemy just by hitting it anywhere, it doesn't really matter, but you can grant you and your party opportunities by exploiting the enemy's weakness.  In the case of a troll for example you can shoot out their legs to prevent them from attacking briefly all the while granting your party an increased chance to hit by way of lowering the troll's evasion.  Another option in the single player mode is using the namesake White Knight to put the fight a little more in to proportion but still fundamentally the same.  There's a lot of variety in this sense though.  You'll encounter a limited number of archetypes for the bigger enemies but exploring these alternative and tactical ways of defeating them is both fun and rewarding as I believe attacking certain body parts can yield certain drops a la Monster Hunter (speculation).Skills and Character Progression-Leveling is pretty typical for the most part, kill a bunch of stuff and complete quests to accrue enough experience to advance a level.  Upon leveling up in addition to a base increase to various stats you are awarded 4 skill points.  These points can be used in several different specialties to grant abilities and stat bonuses to your character.  Each individual specialty has 50 things to buy so with 8 trees you're looking at 400 possible purchases, of which I'd say about 80% are skills the remaining 20% being stat bonuses (guestimates).  Needless to say that's a pretty adequate repertoire to choose from.  Individual characters may more or less select from any set but certain story characters are locked out of certain sets.  Your self created "avatar" is open to choose from them all though.  From what I've read, but I can neither confirm or deny at this juncture, is that your created character is also given a chance for a re-specialization (or respec as we nerds call it) at level 50 and following the completion of the story mode.  This respec supposedly bumps you back to level 35, refunds all of your skill points, and rewards you with 40 additional bonus points.  This can be done upwards of 4 times.  All things considered it's a very flexible system with a lot of possible appeal to min/maxers by having the ability to dip in to multiple trees.  By about level 22 I had "maxed" a single set so those simply going through story mode I imagine will be looking at going fully in to 2 trees or maybe touching base in 2-4.Combos-I just wanted to briefly address the combo system.  After gaining some skills you can freely make your own combos using those skills.  The advantage to a combo is that it allows you to unload several powerful attacks given a single turn counter but they also are costly in terms of battle resources.  In battle you have typical MP which various abilities use, not just magic, and then you also have "Action Chips" which for lack of a better way of putting it is effectively a super bar.  So a combo will typically have a pretty steep MP/AC cost but again this is pretty flexible depending on how many and which skills you build the combo with.  Having a good spammable combo is just as viable as having a devastating nuke.The White Knight-The White Knight is a mechanic of the story and doesn't exist in the online mode.  The main character may transform in to the White Knight at will (space permitting) and may stay in the form for as long as he has MP.  Each attack the Knight uses depletes Leonard's MP and once drained he reverts to his normal form.  Your other party members are allowed to fight alongside the White Knight and as you progress through the game, and Leonard develops, you will acquire equipment for the Knight which boosts the combat abilities of your party members in the presence of the Knight.  The Knight also gets a baseline increase in fighting power as Leonard progresses ranging from skills to stats.Story-Save the princess, save the kingdom, save the world.  Nothing to write home about but it's a serviceable and time honored plot.  It won't be moving any story junkies in any particular way but it is peppered with its charming, humorous, and exciting moments.Online-Here we go, this in my opinion is the meat and potatoes of the game and it's single most redeeming factor.  The format is simple, select a quest, recruit some other players, and head out.  This is all organized in common areas called hometowns.  Initially there is only the one generic town which anybody can access but individual players have the ability to create their own town via the game's Georama system.  The town isn't just a place to plop building and look pretty though.  Depending on which buildings you have and who you put in them can alter various factors of your town such as shop inventories.  Upgrading your Georama hometown is a constant endeavor.  Each individual set piece needs to be crafted which requires having various collected materials from the environment and the world's denizens as well as often large sums of cash.  The residents of your home are also drawn from the single-player world where NPCs with green speech bubbles can be openly recruited.  You're only allowed to have so many NPCs in your roster at a given time so you'll often have to revisit your recruitment efforts to select people of specific professions or finding more able individuals to replace poor performers as your town advances (most recruits have requirements to recruit and aren't immediately available).  There's a lot of subtlety to the system though.  Each NPC has a job and having multiple NPCs with the same job, and furthermore selecting a leader amongst them, grants bonuses to their respective categories (farmers, warriors, mages...) when placed in the same building.  On the flip side penalties can also be issued by mixing your NPCs.So you've got your town and you've got your quests, now what?  As you enter in to a quest you will be met with a staging area where people can prep and meet before the quest starts.  Once all the players are organized the leader may manually start the quest or a pre-determined time limit will automatically initiate the quest.  There isn't necessarily anything fundamentally exciting about the online missions but the difficult is ramped up considerably and the rewards are typically quite good for completing them.  Completing a mission in a timely fashion with varying level of completion also grants a rank for the particular mission and a corresponding scaling in the reward.  Being able to coordinate as a team keeps the battles exciting and rewarding and really ties together the various skill sets.  Magic for example does heaps more damage than bow skills but the bow skill set features many abilities to open up weaknesses for the rest of your party.  All things considered it's very fun and does away with what is sometimes a mundane single player experience to get down to the nuts and bolts of what makes the game enjoyable.The online and offline mode are more or less tied together though.  You must advance through the single player to be granted more access to new areas and online quests so unfortunately those completely appalled by the single player would have to soldier through it to fully access the online mode.  On that same note, those who don't care for the solo-player may find it easier to swallow by doing a little here and there as you push your online efforts forward.And that is basically that.  In conclusion I've found that most of the complaints I've read about the game to be fair, or at the very least not wildly off base, but on that same note the bulk majority of them address only the single player campaign.  From this we can gather that this game offers much more value to those willing and able to access the online mode.  That isn't to say that the single player is a chore, it simply isn't overly impressive in any particular way and it's even harder to get excited about coming off of Mass Effect 2 and leading in to Final Fantasy 13 and several other RPGs.  If sold by itself with no online mode I could only recommend this game in good faith at a bargain price or a rental.Pros-Good character customization, looks and abilities.Extremely fun online play.Big and enjoyable enemies.Cons-Forgettable storySomewhat dated graphicsRather average single player
A semi-traditional RPG with a Wild West theme and action elements.GraphicsThe layer of "haze" that occurs between the action on the screen and the screen itself makes you feel like you are really watching an old Wild West film; but don't worry, if a layer of "haze" sounds obnoxious to you, it is only really apparent in close-up views.Environments are fully 3D and rotateable. Characters are done in a 2D/3D manner; that is to say, they are 2D cel-shaded figures that only appear 3D polygonal, the same visual style they used for characters in Dark Cloud 2. The characters are very anime-ish styled. The atmosphere is that of dusty, desert Wild West world.An anime "screen-saver" also starts up when you leave the game idle for awhile, and I find myself watching it every time I play the game; it's actually real short, though.SoundThe music is done in the traditional style of the Wild West, but they manage to through some rock and jazz in there too. A lot of the music is very action-oriented, as you would expect from something Wild West.There is no voice-acting in this game to complain or complement, except for maybe the vocal song that accompanies the aforementioned anime screen-saver. Although, some voice-acting might've helped, as, when the text proceeds automatically, it sometimes proceeds too quickly.GameplayBattles are very simple and fast-paced: click attack and watch 'em die! Although, there is some strategy involved, too.Like Chrono Cross, you must charge up to use spells and special skills, in which case, you must hit and be hit to acquire "Force Points" to use said spells and special skills. Each character has their own special skill, and you can equip different spell sets as you like.One thing that is irksome about the battle system: you can only run away from a battle BEFORE it begins, but not after the battle has begun. And if you have no idea how powerful the local enemies are, you may be dispositioned to either charge in guns blazing, or avoid the battle with your tail between your legs.Outside of battle, there is a good degree of action, jumping off ledges, avoiding and destroying obstacles and traps, climbing ladders and overhead nets; they let you get some exercise.Another departure from conventional RPGs is having to "search" for your destination on the world map; press the square button, and you can scan the area around you. This is a double-edged sword; it can force you to study the geography of the land and allow you to get in a few level-building battles, but it can also be annoying when you keep searching the same area for your destination and cannot find it. Just keep searching though, your destination will usually appear right out from under your nose, so to speak.OverallAside from the one point of the battle system, it is a rather well-designed game. You want to play this for the characters and story, the Wild West theme, the music, and the action, if not for the traditional RPG strategy.
A semi-traditional RPG with a Wild West theme and action elements.GraphicsThe layer of "haze" that occurs between the action on the screen and the screen itself makes you feel like you are really watching an old Wild West film; but don't worry, if a layer of "haze" sounds obnoxious to you, it is only really apparent in close-up views.Environments are fully 3D and rotateable. Characters are done in a 2D/3D manner; that is to say, they are 2D cel-shaded figures that only appear 3D polygonal, the same visual style they used for characters in Dark Cloud 2. The characters are very anime-ish styled. The atmosphere is that of dusty, desert Wild West world.An anime "screen-saver" also starts up when you leave the game idle for awhile, and I find myself watching it every time I play the game; it's actually real short, though.SoundThe music is done in the traditional style of the Wild West, but they manage to through some rock and jazz in there too. A lot of the music is very action-oriented, as you would expect from something Wild West.There is no voice-acting in this game to complain or complement, except for maybe the vocal song that accompanies the aforementioned anime screen-saver.

This WA is by far an excellent addition to anyone's RPG drawer. Unlike SOME people's bland analyses, this WA is unique in many ways in comparison to its previous cousins.First of all, the story will feel familiar to those of you who played the first WA. A lot of references and names are used in conjunction with this one (including two big surprises in the middle I won't spoil for anyone yet to play this game) and make this game more engrossing. Second, the main character of this game is the first female protagonist for the Wild Arms series and she does a good job of playing the courageous heroine. While she's no Lenneth Valkyrie or Elly Van Houten, Virginia Maxwell performs well fighting injustice throughout Filgaia. To make it more interesting, she is the only female member of the team and the leader of a party that composes males. How's that for girl power? Third, if you loved the ARMS in the last two games, you'll be surprised to know that in this WA, ARMS are your regular weapons and that they are the main weapon of just about everyone you come across in the story. This brings on a feeling of classic wild west since cowboys and cowgirls relied on the same trusty pistols.Now, for the gameplay stats:Story-This WA's story is a tad on the huge side, so you must pay careful attention to details as they come. Of course, if you remember any info from the first WA, this won't be a problem for you. Most of the story's content centers around a lot of scientific detail and terms though, so be prepared for complex explanations.Characters-Your party will compose the same four people for the entire game and each of them develops quite nicely as the story rolls along. In fact, each character has a tough dungeon later on that exclusively stars him/her as the central figure for the plot and helps explain some things that may have confused you before (a.k.a plot fillers, but by no means boring ones).Music-Michiko Naruke, what a genius! She knows her wild west music. Reading everyone's other comments, I'm appalled by your rudeness and lack of musical comprehension. These are some of Naruke's best pieces to date. The use of strings, whistles and drums blend into some nice wild west themes, especially the many town and battle themes. Don't forget that there are also the traditional dark, sad, heroic, goofy and serious themes.Battle System-This WA keeps the tradition of Force Points but now has a newer simplified setup. Each character has one unique Force move (ex: Virginia uses Mystic) and two that they all share, Gatling and Summon. Also, a new feature lets you turn monsters into magic gems when defeated by an elemental guardian summon or spell. The gems can be sold for quick money (which is scarce) or used to cast the same elemental spell that made it. Your ARMS can be upgraded and there are countless setups to have for each ally and while quite expensive, can improve your odds against tougher monsters. Each character's gun is unique in its stats, so you must consider carefully what parameters to build (especially since you can reset them but you don't get your money back). Guardians play a bigger role than before. There are 12 in all and each character can equip three. Each one ups certain parameters and gives the equipper four spells to use (sorry folks, no Crest magic in this WA). There are once again, endless setups, but certain Guardians work best with certain characters.Sound-Magic spells, guns, explosions, horseriding and monster noises all in one game? Quite a coloful bunch of sound FX if you ask me. The gun sounds are especially on the mark.I give this Wild Arms a 5/5. Buy it and enjoy, it rocks! And for those of you who want an extra challenge, the Abyss is back from WA1, but it's now 100 floors and a familiar face awaits at the end. Good luck!

Here's a great way to start a review: Folklore is one of the most disappointing games that I have ever played.  Read on if you want to find out why.Folklore's style is absolutely fantastic.  This is the type of game that Neil Gaiman would envision on one of his really, really good days.  The environments are colorful and dream-like, just filled to the absolute brim with wonder.  I spent a good ten minutes early on wandering around an empty field just watching all sorts of sparkles and colors flow around the world.This charming world frames a dark story about a girl named Ellen who lost her mother as a small child.  As the game begins, she receives an obviously surprising letter from her long dead mother - asking her to come to a small village named Doolin.  At the same time a dude named Keats, who works at a magazine that covers the paranormal, receives a phone call from a woman rambling on about magic and Doolin Village.  Keats decides to go check things out, hoping to land a scoop.The two characters above both arrive safely in Doolin and some serious stuff starts to go down.  The story is told through a variety of techniques, from traditional RPG fare like cutscenes and character models trading text boxes back and forth to something a bit more progressive - a sort of animated comic book feel with frames and speech bubbles.  This technique works very well and definitely keeps the storytelling feeling fresh.The bulk of the gameplay revolves around battling weird monsters, the Folk.  As you progress through the game Folk, you are able to rip out the Id (soul) of a wounded Folk in order to gain their powers.  This is how you unlock abilities and become more powerful as the game moves along.  Each Folk has a few different powers available, ranging from various attacks and shields to combo extensions and status bonuses.Early on in the game you run into a Folk named Pouke, and absorbing his Id allows you to summon Pouke and perform a basic attack.  Absorb five or ten more Pouke Ids and you'll increase the number of attacks in your basic combo.  You'll also find a weird Folk named Henky, who flies around shooting bubbles.  Absorb his Id and you'll be able to fire off bubbles to take down enemies up in the air.  Give Henky five Pine Nuts, and you'll 'level up' your mastery of the Henky Folk and reduce the MP consumption.  Some Folk abilities require you to provide items, some require you to defeat a specific Folk with another specific Folk, and so on down the line.Once you gain a bunch of Folk abilities, you're able to mix and match as you see fit and assign each one to a button on the controller.  This allows you to customize your Folk Id repertoire and design an arsenal that fits your style.  It's a lot of fun to determine the weak points of new enemies and figure out the best way to defeat them.  It's very satisfying to win a battle after busting out three or four completely different abilities.  Visually the combat looks great and gives you plenty of sweet effects to keep your interest - the only bummer is that the framerate occasionally reaches the 'starting to get painful' level.Based on everything I've said thus far, Folklore sounds totally badass doesn't it?  Sure it does, and this is what makes it such a disappointing game.  As I mentioned above, there are two main characters: Keats and Ellen.  They aren't just main characters, they are both playable characters - which is the beginning of the problem.The game is divided up into a number of different chapters.  Let's say that you play and complete chapter one with Keats - you do not have the option of playing chapter two with Ellen.  In order to play chapter two with Ellen, you need to go back and replay chapter one with her first.  There are minor differences in the how the same chapters plays out with two different characters (different Folk abilities, some different items and abilities, different views of the storyline), but in practice things are very much the same.After figuring out how things worked, I decided that playing every level through twice in a row is for suckers - I chose Ellen and decided to play through the entire game as her.  Maybe I'd miss part of the story, but hey, that's how things go.  If I ever decide to pick up the game and play it again in five years I'll play as Keats and get a different view on things.Everything was going according to plan until I hit a chapter and realized that I needed Keats to be up to the same level as Emily in order to continue with the game.  This meant putting on the breaks and replaying the entire games with Keats.  The idea of stopping at (or towards) the climax of a game in order to replay the entire thing took all of the wind out of Folklore's sails for me.  I guess this was a way to turn a six hour game into a twelve hour game?  I don't really know, but it turned an awesome gaming experience for me into a terrible one.  As much as I got out of the game, I just never went back to it.  I just don't have enough time to play video games these days, and I definitely don't want to spend that time replaying something that I just played.  What a bummer.With all of that being said, I can't wait for Folklore 2.
While sitting in his trailer in a Florida trailer park, Jack Mower (along with his TV!) is suddenly sucked through a vortex into the quasi-medieval world of Nox.  There he finds he's the only person who can rid that world of the evil and malevolent sorceress, Hecubah, and he can't go home until he does.  He can choose to follow the path of the warrior, conjurer or wizard, each with its own attributes, skills and challenges.  Your character is always male, but if you have something against the name Jack, you can change it, along with other physical attributes.I started out as a warrior, because that's usually the easiest character to play in these adventure/RPG hybrid games, since you have plenty of brawn to hack and slash your way through the foes, while toting about practically everything you come across.  It soon became apparent that enough money to enable purchase of the really cool stuff is hard to come by, especially if you want to keep your weapons and armour in good shape.  Even if you tote about all you can carry, it doesn't raise much when you get to a shop.  Also, one of the areas is practically impossible to negotiate without ranged weapons, which are prohibitively expensive, and you don't find many on corpses or in chests.  The warrior has no magic skills at all and is dependent on food and potions for healing and curing.  You can only carry a limited amount at once and you always seem to run out at critical moments.I left my warrior in the castle and started out again as a conjurer, as I'd read in some reviews that this is the most diverse and interesting character to play.  Well, I haven't played as a wizard, and probably won't, but playing the conjurer is great fun.  You visit the same places, but have quite different challenges and meet different people.  A conjurer can use bows, crossbows and staves, can wear leather armour (some you find in the latter stages are pretty cool) and has heaps of offensive, defensive and healing magic at his disposal.  The most interesting spell enables you to charm animals to assist you and later you can even summon them to help.  Your great mid-game foe, the mimic, is a worthy ally when summoned, especially against the vampire lichs.  In one of Nox's great ironies, monsters in the conjurer game drop heaps of ranged weapons that a warrior would kill for, but which are useless to the conjurer and raise hardly any cash.  I'd advise not to buy arrows, as you find more than enough in the latter stages and you can use the cash for better purposes.  And carry a few spare sets of armour into the final chapter, as you'll go through it quickly and any armour is better than none.Nox has often been compared with Diablo, and while I can see why that comparison can be drawn, I would liken it more to Revenant.  Like Revenant, it has a good story line, very impressive graphics, and a very simple control system.  But it leaves both Diablo and Revenant floundering in its wake, since it has a pleasing amount of gameplay, acceptable voice acting, challenging (but not impossible) puzzles, and a satisfactory ending.  I wasn't having much success in the final showdown, so I restored and tried a different approach (always take note of your latest find - it's often a clue to defeating your next foe).  That time Hecubah could not withstand the concerted attack, and after a great little final cut scene, Jack (and the TV) were restored to Earth.I'd read that Nox is very fast, and boy, was that an understatement.  Battles in this game, particularly in the latter stages, needs amazing reflexes, something I'm not overly endowed with.  However, I am blessed with cunning and persistence, and after my character died three or four (or even ten) times, I'd managed to figure out the puzzle, or a good strategy against the monster(s).  Some of the later monsters move with lightning speed, often only needing one hit to splatter Jack and his gear all over the screen, so a well-positioned charmed or summoned ally makes an excellent distraction, allowing Jack the nanosecond needed to get off a good shot or spell (I didn't have much success with bombs).I loved Nox, but since I've revised my personal scoring system, I can only give it 4 stars.  I'm saving 5 for that really unforgettable game, and although Nox was great fun, it really was too similar to Diablo and Revenant to outscore them.

Hi there! I will be writing a detailed review of Battlefield 4. I'll be dividing the main features into sections; multiplayer, singleplayer, weapons, vehicles, etc.A little background for those who are new to the Battlefield series. The Battlefield games incorporate teamwork, a lot of weapons, and a whole lot of vehicles. Any military vehicle you see on the battlefield can be driven. Since the very first BF game, BF1942, you can do this. Hop into a Sherman tank, ME109 fighter, and Tiger tank. It's still the same in BF4. Roll in a Russian T-90 tank, DV-15 attack boat, Warthog ground attack jet, and much more. If you like epic large scale combat with infantry attacks supports with heavy tanks and helicopters this game is for you! The amount of content is huge; you'll be immersed in it for months if not years. This game offers the option to use different types of tank munitions! Same goes for attack boats, you can choose 25mm cannons or 30mm cannons.Without further ado let's start.Multiplayer: Multiplayer is the main reason people buy these games, this mode let's you have endless fun. In the Multiplayer mode you have the options for Quick Match, Server Brower, and Test Range.Quick Match let's you choose from a list of game modes and joins you to a random server on a random map. You don't have the option to choose a map.In Server Browser you can search for servers and join any map you want. You can see how many players there are on the server, the type of server, the ping, map rotation, settings, region, game mode, etc. You can view your History, which servers you've played on recently. You can add any server to your Favorites list. You can also search for server by name. Right now all servers playable are managed by DICE/EA, I don't know when rentable server will come online. In Battlefield 3 you are able to rent server and choose the map rotation, if you want to play on Parcel Storm all the time you can do that on your server. You can adjust settings to. I'm sure rentable servers for BF4 will become available in the coming months.Test Range: This is a great feature. Here you can test all of your weapons and vehicle specializations. You have a map on which you have a shooting range with targets, you have every single type of vehicle to use, you have tanks, jeeps, boats, but all of them are the US version. The map is similar to Parcel Storm. Many times I unlock a new gun but I want to test it out before using it in battle, I can go here and see how much, recoil, accuracy it has, etc.Another good thing is if you are lagging too much to the point that you can't play on online servers you can come here and it won't lag. Even though you have to be signed into PSN and EA to go in it, it won't lag. If you're disconnected from PSN for example it'll send you back to the main menu. It seems this feature is an offline design but to be able to use it you have to be online. Pretty strange.By now I bet you're dying to read about the weapons and vehicles so I'll start already.Weapons: There is a huge amount of guns to choose from. I'll list a few:Assault Class, Assault Rifles: AK-12, SAR-21, CZ-805All Kits, Carbine: AK-5C, ACE 52 CQB, ACW-R, M4, Type 95B-1All Kits, Designated Marksmen Rifle: RFB, SKS, SVD-12, QBU-88, SCAR-H SVEngineer Class, Personal Defense Weapons (PDWs): P-90, UMP-9, MK4, CZ-3A1, JS2All Kits, Shotguns: QBS-09, Hawk 12G, Spas-12, UTS-15, DBV-12Support Class, Light Machine Guns: U-100 MKS, PKP Pecheneg, QBB-95-1, MG4, RPK-12Recon Class, Sniper Rifles: CS-LR4, Scout Elite, JNG-90, 338-Recon, SRR-61You have 7 types of grenades.4 types of anti-tank weapons like the classic RPG-7 and the new FGM-172 SRAW.You can choose different knife as well like the Specnaz Machete, Bowie, and more.These are just a few, I haven't listed all of them.Battle Pickups: There are some weapons which you can only use by picking them up from the battlefield. At certain points on the maps are locations of unique weapons like the, M32 MGL grenade launcher, M82A3 .50 caliber sniper rifle which is capable of one hit kills, and others like rocket launchers and shotguns. You cannot unlock things for these weapons. They're pre-set with certain attachments. They also have limited ammo which cannot be replenished by ammo boxes and if you, for example, have 11 rounds ready to fire in a sniper rifle and 11 in reserve, and you shoot 2 round off and reload you will have wasted the remaining 9 rounds, you'll be now using the remain 11 rounds. This is not the case with the rest of the weapons which you unlock.The amount and type of attachments has increased since BF3. You have 4 accessory slots and a have the option to put on camouflage.On the first accessory slot you can put on sights like, the PKA-5, Coyote (RDS), Prisma (3.4x), ACOG (4x), HD-33 and many more.On the second slot you can have the Laser Sight, Tri-Beam Laser, Canted Ironsights, which is a secondary sight which can be switched over to by one click of the up button on the D-Pad, or a Magnifier which magnifies, for example, the Reflex sight by 2x.On the third slot you have everything barrel related; things like the Heavy Barrel, Flash Hider, Chinese and Russian Suppressors.On the forth slot you have everything handle related; here you can put on grips like the Angled Grip, Stubby Grip, and Potato Grip.Camouflage: There are a ton of paint jobs you can put on weapons and on your vehicles.You have Miscellaneous which is a mix of different types of camos. Then Autumn, Desert, Naval, Snow, Urban, Woodland, and Adaptive.All of these camos have, other than the ones under Miscellaneous, have 11 types of patterns. You have, for example, with Naval, Atomic Naval, Dot Naval, Erol Naval, Flat Naval, Flecktarn Naval,, Hexagon Naval, Splinter Naval, Spray Naval, Starburst Naval, Tiger Naval, Reed Naval. Same would go with Woodland, like Atomic Woodland, Starburst Woodland, etc.When you equip any type of Adaptive camo it auto selects a camo type which is suitable for the map you're on. For example if I choose Dot Adaptive and I'm playing on Parcel Storm my weapon will have a Dot Naval paint job on it, and when I go to the next map, which is Golmud Railway, my gun camo will have automatically change to a dot desert type camo.You can put camos on pistols to, but not on knifes and equipment like mines, grenades, rocket launchers, etc.One problem is there are 2 sections for camos, one for weapons and vehicles and the second for soldiers. There are 92 camos in total that you can put on weapons and vehicles but these camos cannot be put on a soldier's uniform. There are only 4 camos available to soldier and 6 if you have Premium. Each nation's soldier camos are only slightly different from each other. It makes no sense to put in 92 camos which can't be worn by soldiers. A disappointment but not something too big I guess.Soldier Kits: You have 4 soldier kits that you can play as. Assault, Engineer, Support, andRecon.Every kit has 7 slots (not including camo) which you can customize. These are Primary Weapon, Secondary Weapon, Gadget One, Gadget Two, Grenade, Knife, and Field Upgrades.Primary Weapon: Each class has a dedicated weapon type. The Assault's dedicated weapon is the assault rifle. Other main guns that can be used with the assault class, this goes for all kits actually, are the Carbines, Shotguns and DMRs. The Engineer's dedicated weapon are the PDWs (Personal Defense Weapons), the Support's dedicated weapon are the light machine guns, and the Recon's dedicated weapon are the sniper rifles. Dedicated weapons are not interchangeable; for example I can't use assault rifles with the Recon class but I can use Carbines, Shotguns or DMRs with any class. These are interchangeable.Secondary Weapon: Secondary Weapons are pistols.Gadget One: In the first Gadget slot you can choose to use something which is unique to that class, for example the Assault class can use either Defibrillators or a grenade launcher, in the Engineer class you can choose a rocket launcher, anti-aircraft launcher, mines, or a EOD Bot, in the Support class you can choose ammo packs, air burst grenade launcher, mortar, MP-APS, or C4 Explosive, and in the Recon class you can choose a PLD targeting device, Motion Sensor, Radio Beacon, T-UGS, SOFLAM, MAV, or M18 Claymore.Gadget Two: The second gadget slot lets you choose another gadget to use.Grenades: You have 7 types or grenades you can use. You have the normal M67 Frag, V-40 Mini which can be thrown farther than the M67, RGO Impact which explodes seconds after hitting a surface, M34 Incendiary makes a cloud of burning particles, M18 Smoke creates a smokescreen, M84 Flashbang which temporarily blind enemies, and the Hand Flare which is a flare which burns to light up dark areas and provides a small blinding effect.Knife: You can choose different types of hand-to-hand weapons. Depending from which angle you come from and hit the knife button your soldier will go into a small animation of them knifing the enemy. Different knifes will all have the same kill animations.Field Upgrades: Field Upgrades are pre-set upgrades which you get if you do well on the battlefield. Each set has 4 levels; on each level you progress you get a benefit. If I choose the Offensive set I will get on...Level 1 Sprint: Increases maximum Sprint Speed by 10%Level 2 Ammo: Increases maximum inventory of Bullets by 50%Level 3 Grenades: Increases maximum inventory of Hand Grenades by 1Level 4 Reduced Fall: Increases height you can fall without DamageIf I choose the Defensive set my upgrades will be related to defense like more armor and decrease damage from explosives. There are 3 upgrades available to all soldier classes, these are Defensive, Offensive, and Shadow. There are 2 more upgrade sets which are unique to their classes. The Assault has Defensive, Offensive, Shadow, Combat Medic, and Grenadier, and the Support class has Defensive, Offensive, Shadow, Indirect Fire, and Perimeter Defense. Same goes for the other 2 classes, 3 main sets available to all, 2 sets unique to each one.You cannot choose individual perks like in BF3.Vehicles: Vehicles include main battle tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, mobile anti-aircraft, attack boats, RIB boats, jet skies, stealth jets, attack jets, scout helicopters, attack helicopters, mobile artillery, ATVs, jeeps.Majority of ground combat vehicles like MBTs and IFVs have 5 driver slots (not including paint) to customize and 2 gunner customizations.You can use High Explosive shells and SABOT shells for the tanks. You can have a secondary armament like the Guided Shell, Coaxial Light/Heavy Machine Gun, or STAFF shells.Countermeasures like Infrared Smoke and Active Protection which pre-detonates incoming missiles and warheads.You can choose zoom, IRNV, and thermal optics.Choose upgrades like Autoloader to get shells into the breach faster and Reactive Armor to help reduce damage done by explosives.You can customize 2 things for the gunner position, optics and upgrades. Choose the type of sights you want and the upgrade you want like proximity scan, SOFLAM, and incendiary grenades.Things I'm describing here are not everything, keep this in mind!For IFV's you can choose 25mm HE shells, APFSDS-T shells, or Canister shells. For your secondary, blast enemy armor away with the manually guided TOW Missile or free fire Zuni Rockets.Same goes for Mobile AA choose to use 20mm Vulcan cannons or 30mm cannons. Missiles include Heatseekers, Active Radar missiles, Zuni Rockets.Outfit scout choppers with twin 7.62mm miniguns or 25mm cannons.Fire Hydra Rockets or Smart Rockets which guide their way to their target.Ground attack aircraft can fire laser guided missiles heatseekers, even JDAM bombs!If you've played BF3 you know by now BF3 should have had all this. So many more options!Battlepacks: By now you might have heard of something called Battlepacks. Battlepacks are, "Battlepacks add an all-new layer of persistence to the multiplayer progression system in Battlefield 4. Through the course of your multiplayer career, you will receive Battlepacks containing random combinations of new camos, dog tags, knives, XP boosts, and more! These items are designed to add customization options to give you more personalization options on the Battlefield." -Battlelog descriptionThat right there sums it up. But you might be wonder what are XP boosts exactly? They are "items" when activated boost the amount of point you get in round by a certain percentage. There are 3 types of boosts, 25%, 50%, and 100%. You can only get these through Battlepacks and the chances of getting them are random. Boosts last for exactly 1 hour of gameplay. Even when you're in the menu waiting to spawn it won't count that as gameplay, gameplay is when you're on the map fighting. Boosts are calculated at the end of matches; when I activate a 50% boost it will take the 50% of my total match score and add it on top of what I earned.Single-player: The single-player is much more special forces type, a lot like Bad Company 2 where you have an elite squad which does wonders and can take on the whole Russian and Chinese army and prevail. It's a short storyline but it's quite fun and immersive. The campaign consists of 7 missions; the missions are pretty long so that's a plus. Nonetheless I finished it in 2-3 days. It depends on how faster you are and how much you play, I play a lot so I finished it quickly. The environment is really interactive as well. It's quite cinematic. Graphics are amazing even on the current-generation PS3. You might think they look the same as BF3 but they've improved definitely.A nice feature they've added is when you kill an enemy you get points as you would in multi-player. You also have some weapons which can be unlocked through the campaign which can be used in it and in multiplayer.Maps and Levolution: The maps in multiplayer are awesome! You have small, medium, and large sized maps. On some of them like Parcel Storm you have dynamic weather, the sunny sky and calm waters turn to high winds, rain, and roaring seas which affects gameplay. As the seas get more violent you can swerve through and hide behind waves which will shield you from enemy fire. You can also trigger "Levolution" events which are doing things like bringing down skyscrapers, destroying a dam to flood the map, even making a destroyer ship crash onto shore which will kill anyone caught in its way. Cool stuff. You also have the iconic destruction; a lot of things can be destroyed and it's much more easy to bring down 2 storey buildings than it is in BF3. The look of the maps is spectacular.Special Feature: There are a few new features that have been added which are worth the mention. One feature is the option to lean around corners. When you go up close to a wall, tree, crate, anything really, your soldier will cradle the weapon, it'll appear as if your weapon is being held more closely, at that point when you press the aim button your soldier will lean around the corner. This is not only limited to corners, you can can also look over things.Swimming has been improved. You can use pistols and some equipment like C4 or the repair tools in the water, you can also submerge under the water and go out of sight.Technical Problems: I haven't had too many problems with the game. It sometimes freezes at random types but other than that it's pretty good.Overall this game is amazing! Great multiplayer and campaign. Superb gameplay. I don't know why there are so many 1 and 2 star reviews. It's a huge improvement over BF3.I will also write down the BF4 DLC reviews once I've played them.When I had ordered the game and as it was on it's way I read some reviews and forums on Battlelog. I got a little panicky. Everyone was saying how bad the net-code was and the glitches, freezes, crashes, etc. The game does freezes sometimes, the net-code can be a bit better, but I haven't found any glitches.I wasn't expecting this game to be like this, I'm impressed how much they've improved.If you have any questions ask me.
Battlefield 1942 - The Complete Collection comes with the original Battlefield 1942 (BF1942) game, the two expansions  The Road to Rome and Secret Weapons of World War II, Battlefield Vietnam.  I'll talk about BF1942 first. I've had this game a long time, but never got around to playing it. I tend to enjoy single player games so BF1942 for me doesn't beat the classic first person shooter (FPS) storyline games likeCall of Duty: Game of the Year Edition,Medal of Honor Allied Assault Deluxe, andBrothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30. The single player campaign basically allows you to play the multiplayer maps in order with the computer AI controlling all the other soldiers. The gameplay is the same for both multiplayer and single player. If you get killed you respan at your selected control point, the objective usually being kill enemy soldiers and capture enemy control points in order to reduce their starting tickets (points) to zero. Even for multiplayer, I prefer more strategy type games likeCompany of Heroes. Some strategy is required for BF1942 because while you have unlimited troops, time is limited especially if you have less control points than the enemy. Also if you do not play as a team you tend to get torn to pieces by your opponents.Some negatives: In single player, on maps with any pinch points, your teammate AI tends to get slowed down with vehicles doing circles (even with support to AI all the way up). The game crashes on me occasionally when loading missions (usually after playing several missions). You can't see if you hit anything with the sniper rifle as zoom in is removed when you reload. Check the reported kills to see if you hit or scan the field after you reload. Similar it is hard to tell if you hit with bazooka due to smoke trail unless you shift your position (kind of annoying if you cover doesn't allow it). There are countless odd glitches during combat especially around vehicles (these don't disrupt game play much though). Environment not destructible and destroyed vehicles and troops disappear (these items would take more memory).So what makes all these people rate the game so high. BF1942 has lots of features that the other FPS don't have. BF1942 allows you to employ vehicles in combat in multiplayer. You can jump into jeeps, tanks, airplanes, ships, artillery turrets, and fixed machine gun nests. This makes gameplay interesting. The other important feature in BF is the ability to specialize your infantry between assault troops, snipers, anti-tank, medics, and engineers. In this way you don't just pick up different weapons on the field of battle, you get to pick your kit to suit your mission or role. Each have their abilities and weaknesses, but as a combination they are stronger.I would also note that even though this is very old title there is still an active multiplayer community. I was able to jump right into a multiplayer game with a large group of other players with no lag.Battlefield 1942 Expansion: The Road to RomeCovers the Italian campaign. It comes with 6 new maps and two new armies (French and Italians). The expansion includes for the Americans M3 Grant (medium tank) and M3 GMC (tank destroyer/mobile artillery), for the British the Mosquito (bomber) and the 25pdr (stationary AT gun), for the Italians the M11-39 Carro Armato (medium tank), and for the Germans the Sturmgeschutz (tank destroyer),PAK75 (stationary AT gun), and the BF 110 (fighter/bomber). Two infantry assault weapons include the British Sten SMG and the Italian Breda Modello 30.Battlefield 1942: Secret Weapons of WWII Expansion PackComes with 8 new maps and two new armies (British Commandos and German Elite). The expansion include one of each of the following for each team: jet powered fighter (F-85 Goblin - Allies and Natter Rocket Plane - Germans), flying wing fighter/bomber (AW-52 - Allies and HO 229 - Germans), motorcycle with MG armed sidecar, amphibious assault vehicles (LVT-2 Water Buffalo - Allies and Schwimmwagen - Germans), commando rafts, specialty tanks (Sherman armed with T-34  Calliope and T95/T28 Heavy Tank - Allies and Flakpanzer and Sturmtiger - Germans). All in all the allied vehicle additions are the most affective IMO. However, the Germans got the best infantry weapons in the expansion. German assault troops get the FG 42, engineers get the Mauser K98 with grenade attachment, and most importantly the Gewehr 43 sniper rifle allows semi auto fire and you can still see your target (or what's left of them) after each shot. The allies get the Bren for assault troops, silenced Sten MK2 for medics, and shotgun for engineer. Of course, for those thrill seekers the rocket pack has also been added. These can be found hidden in upstairs rooms in certain buildings.The new armies, vehicles, and weapons from the expansions can only be used on certain maps from the respective expansion. The maps are fun and fairly well balanced. However, there are very few servers that actually play the expansions. If you already have BF1942, I wouldn't bother with the expansions unless you are a diehard fan.  But if you are looking at getting  BF1942 you might as well get them all.Battlefield: Vietnam(BFV)There is a noticeable improvement in the graphics from BF1942. Running through the jungle in BFV reminded me of the movie Platoon.  The nostalgic 60s music also provides great atmosphere and gets you ready to jump into the battle. The weapons are fun and extra options for the different infantry types allows for more customization. BFV land vehicles are not much better than BF1942, but the helicopters are pretty cool. Unfortunately my piloting skills are pretty poor so I had to rely on others for an airlift. But the damage the Cobra gunships can dish out with a good pilot is incredible. It also is a lot of fun to let loose with the 50 cal on the Hueys. I would say if you only want a land based game, BFV is really not for you. Most maps allow for aerial combat.I felt the single player experience on BFV was better than BF1942. I think this type of setting is better suited to Battlefield's style of gameplay. However, the AI would at times cause frustration by having everyone going after one control point (and still not being able to take it) while I'm left to fend off all the bad guys trying to capture the other control points.I would note that there is still an active multiplayer community. However, there are far fewer people playing BFV as there are playing BF1942.
As is said above, this is definatly the best WW2 FPS out on the market now, the game runs very smootly on my P4 1.8 GHZ 32mb graphics card and below averge 128RAM, stomping down and choking the never ending lagginess of BattleFeild 1942 and having enough relism to seriously injure the Nazi Zombies and Demons of RTCW. The graphics are pretty good and run perfeclty on Medium and slightly laggy on High, but still are very stunning on my prefered setting, medium texures with all the other settings at high. The level disign is fanstastic, every level has some stupendous, exciting part of it, from Running up a hill in a line with your 5 squad menmbers in the Algiers level, to looking out at the never-ending horizon of the ocean in a Nazi U2 harbor, with an ever moving and dynamic factory behind you, or storming up the long and hard beaches of omahah beach in normandy with constant explosions, men running up the shoreline, men hiding behind dragons teeth (the tank traps) and frequent reinforcements coming from boats back at the shoreline, that D-Day level is great, beef up the sound quality to high, put you two speakers on your left and right sides, turn them up as high as they go, and you will be completly immersed in the virtual normandy, and constanly lost in all the exlosions and gunfire of fake war. My second favorite level in in Brittany, France, which looks just like the sniper and child scene in saving private ryan, with houses blown in half with blackened, powdery furniturte inside, snipers hiding in church towers, and a rumbling thunder storm overhead with an occasional bolt of lighting to scare you in a few places. After defeating all the eagle eyed and Inhumanly accurate Nazi Snipers in the area, it can be very good for you to walk around and appreacitate the scenery. So the level design and scenery is fanstastic, and it runs pretty well on slightly below-average computers, so what about the gameplay. Well, this game, i'll tell you now, Is definatly now for Rainbow Six fans, it is definatly a shoot-em-up where you shoot anything that moves with infuriating rage and ignoring all aspects of stealth whatsoever. But the people who like those games will definatly love this one, with its realistic weapon sounds, satisfying death animations, and a great grenade throwing method (you dont have to waste time holding the mouse button, just press it once and there goes the grenade). But people who like the realistic game will slightly like this one too, the sound is so realistic, the AI is pretty good (watching nazis run from and incoming granade and then seeing a couragues one kick it back at you is too cool), and realistic squad commands can make this game a favorite for both types of gamers. Lastly, the multiplayer experience is great, I've been playing it on a dial up modem, and you can move and doge bullets at lag-less speeds, but after you press fire, you have to wait about 1/2 a second before the gun actually fires. Its still great though, Imagine this, two allied players stand on the side of a door, another comes in between them and opends it, all of a sudden all hell is let lose and the door-opening player is blown back by sudden machine gun fire, the other two player both lean out to avenge their freind's death, but fail to escape the explosions of the two grenades that suddenly come lobing from the door, about four nazis player spring from the door feeding many machine gun bullets at the remaing allied troops, and after about a half minute full of gunfighting, the four nazi players are finnaly eliminated in one titanic instant from two lucky allied machine-gunners. The objective mode, which was just described, is pretty team based, although there are many people who refuse to work. This mode has a certain objective to each level, such as Nazi team blow up a bridge, allied team defend it, Nazi team protect you rocket, Allied team blow it up, and the same thing with a flak cannon. This is definaly the preffered mode over the average FFA, team FFA's, and No Respawn FFA. The objective mode is pretty much a No Respown Team FFA, with the addition of the objectives and the relating teamwork. As in the single player mode, level design is great, with many sniping spots in French villages, close-combat in the V2 Rocket facilty, and a combantion of both in The Bridge level, plus theres a multiplayer objective map that is omahah beach itself, only with re-spawns for the allies. After beating the single player mode, I have been completly obssed with multiplayer, and even thoughe that part is not nearly as good as Battle Feild 1942, is a very, very big loud blast.

When I read previews of MOHAA back in around november/september I was extremely excited for this game to come out. Finally! A game that captures the actual D-Day from first person! MOHAA's centerpiece is the Normandy Invasion on Omaha Beach. However, I must say that when I played the D-Day level finally it was quite dissapointing. The invasion is only small scale and the events are ripped shamelessly from the WW2 hit movie: Saving Private Ryan. The run up the beach is incredibly short and pretty easy. The events are all scripted so that if a soldier is scripted to die, he will die automatically in the place where he's supposed to die. This means that there's no possible way to have any variety. You get to the shingle and go to get bangalors like in SPR(Saving Private Ryan). You then explode the shingle like in SPR and run to the base of one of the giant bunkers.About 10 guys run over the shingle with you, but only you and 3 others make it because it's scripted to have the others die automatically. The captain in your battalion looks almost exactly like Tom Hanks did in SPR. The men at the bunker base with you are the Tom Hanks captain, the Sergeant guy from SPR who was bald and is bald underneath his helmet. And some random Private. Captain tells Segeant and Private to run across to the other bunker the space to it is covered by machine gun(s) just like in SPR. They run across and are scripted to get killed so they die. You run across snipe the machine gunners like the sniper did in SPR who instantly reappear and run into a trench.Now is where it just turns into an FPS game. You go on to take out an entire German bunker by yourself which is incredibly unrealistic. It would've been a better level if you could go to the top of the bluffand clear that out, but no. The case in the single player MOHAA is that the levels lack much depth although it is fun to be in disguise as a German officer and walk around not being shot at....hehehe =)The graphics in MOHAA are good like in the D-Day level when you're in the Higgins Boats the soldiers around you actually look scared..... MOHAA's audio and graphics are quite amazing. MOHAA could've used more larger scale battles like the D-Day invasion except more realistic. MOHAA's multiplayer I think is the best part about it. It has 8 or more(+) maps and 4 or 5 different types of multiplayer games to play. Realistic and all extremely fun to play! Maps: Stalingrad, Omaha Beach, Destroyed French Village, etc. etc.....Games: Team Deathmatch, Objective Based Match, etc. etc.....For what it's worth:BUY MEDAL OF HONOR: ALLIED ASSAULT!!! AND BUY IT NOW! AS QUICK AS YOU CAN!!!HEHEHEHEHEHE..... ;)=)

Spearhead foreshadowed the horror that is Breakthough, through a shortfall in the single player campaign.  The campaign had numberous flaws; too short, ridiculous missions and various little things that I won't go into.The campaign starts with you parachuting into France during Operation Overlord.  You land in a barn, and fight your way to your British comrades where for some reason your M1 Garand, MP40 and Colt .45 are replaced with an Enfield, Sten and Webley revolver.  I'm not sure why, I guess it's so you can use different weapons for a change.  I hear a lot of people complaining about having to use the Enfield instead of the Garand, but you can just use the Sten if you don't like the Bolt-Action rifle.  Either way, the campaign starts off well as you and your new friends wander the countryside blowing up artillery pieces and finally a bridge ending in a predictable cutscene where the bridge blows up as the train is about to cross and it ends up falling into the water.  Either way, the campaign is not bad up to this point.  No complaints.Next, you're in the Ardennes fighting your way past German lines to steal a supply truck.  This part is ok, you navigate the map, blowing up Nebelwerfers (rocket launcher artillery that you should remember if you paid attenion in Allied Assault) after you use them to blow up German tanks and half tracks.  Everything's ok so far.  Once you reach a German supply depot, you fight your way to a supply truck where the campaign goes crashing into a river like the train in France.  Next thing you know, you're in a half track with an anti-tank cannon.  Your job will now be to protect the supply truck from swarms of Germans with perfect aim at great distances.  Once you beat this part, you'll know why Hitler lost the Battle of the Bulge seeing how many tanks and half tracks you'll have to destroy just to pass.  If by some miracle you do, rest assured it doesn't get better.  The next section is just a waste of time, plain and simple.  You have to run from foxhole to foxhole, waiting for the artillery barrage to stop.  After what seems like 8 hours and 50 foxholes later, you reach the medic where you have to repeat the whole thing again.  They should have just left this out as it's not challenging at all and it adds nothing to the game.  Still, the worst is not yet over.  Next you'll have to hold the line which is sort of fun as you're basically slaughtering a horde of German soldiers, but you'll fail in the most pointless of ways, if one German (it doesn't matter if he's the last one) makes it into your trench.  Apparently that's all it takes, even if you kill him a second after.  Then you have to run to another line and repeat the process and then go back and do it once more.  From then on, the campaign picks up.  You advance and clear out a town and your part in the Ardennes is over.  Nothing more worth mentioning, really.Berlin will satsify those are obsessed with sniping as it's pretty much laid out for that.  Long ranges, rubble, unsuspecting Germans, you get a nice Russian semi-automatic sniper rifle.  I prefer the Mosin Nagant (even more so because I actually own one in real life.)  You'll get to blow up some tanks with sticky bombs and 88mm artillery cannons.  You steal the plans then the game takes a course for the bizarre.  You'll find yourself controlling a Russian T-34 all by yourself.  At least in Allied Assault, you had a team, but this is ridiculous.  That means you drive the tank and operate the gun (that is loading, firing and aiming) all by yourself with your head outside the turret (!!!).  That's one well trained soldier.  Then you fight your way back to where you started with the Russian guys I neglected to mention earlier where there's a (suprise) large dramatic tank battle.  When you win, it's all over.  Painfull short, not that great.The multiplayer is where Spearhead really shines.  It really makes up for Allied Assault's mediocre multiplayer by adding new modes of play (Tug of War which is a more flexible kind of Objective match, really) maps, skins, weapons, etc...  Being able whack people with nearly every single weapon instead of just pistols is nice.  The Russian PPSH is very nice for short ranges (near bottomless clip) and gives Allies the chance to use bolt-action rifles if they want.  Replacing the shotgun for the Germans is the much whined about rifle grenade which is really fun to use.  Even though players claim it is the same a the rocket launcher, it's not.  You're more of a rifleman (it's just a Mauser Kar 98k that can fire a grenade at an arc at longer distances than you can throw a hand grenade.)  You don't get regular grenades so you just exchange how you can use  your grenades.All in all, if the multiplayer wasn't such a huge improvement, I'd give it 3 stars.  If singleplayer was better, I'd give it 5 stars.  Either way, it's well worth your money as long as you like to play multiplayer.
Spearhead foreshadowed the horror that is Breakthough, through a shortfall in the single player campaign.  The campaign had numberous flaws; too short, ridiculous missions and various little things that I won't go into.The campaign starts with you parachuting into France during Operation Overlord.  You land in a barn, and fight your way to your British comrades where for some reason your M1 Garand, MP40 and Colt .45 are replaced with an Enfield, Sten and Webley revolver.  I'm not sure why, I guess it's so you can use different weapons for a change.  I hear a lot of people complaining about having to use the Enfield instead of the Garand, but you can just use the Sten if you don't like the Bolt-Action rifle.  Either way, the campaign starts off well as you and your new friends wander the countryside blowing up artillery pieces and finally a bridge ending in a predictable cutscene where the bridge blows up as the train is about to cross and it ends up falling into the water.  Either way, the campaign is not bad up to this point.  No complaints.Next, you're in the Ardennes fighting your way past German lines to steal a supply truck.  This part is ok, you navigate the map, blowing up Nebelwerfers (rocket launcher artillery that you should remember if you paid attenion in Allied Assault) after you use them to blow up German tanks and half tracks.  Everything's ok so far.  Once you reach a German supply depot, you fight your way to a supply truck where the campaign goes crashing into a river like the train in France.  Next thing you know, you're in a half track with an anti-tank cannon.  Your job will now be to protect the supply truck from swarms of Germans with perfect aim at great distances.  Once you beat this part, you'll know why Hitler lost the Battle of the Bulge seeing how many tanks and half tracks you'll have to destroy just to pass.  If by some miracle you do, rest assured it doesn't get better.  The next section is just a waste of time, plain and simple.  You have to run from foxhole to foxhole, waiting for the artillery barrage to stop.  After what seems like 8 hours and 50 foxholes later, you reach the medic where you have to repeat the whole thing again.  They should have just left this out as it's not challenging at all and it adds nothing to the game.  Still, the worst is not yet over.  Next you'll have to hold the line which is sort of fun as you're basically slaughtering a horde of German soldiers, but you'll fail in the most pointless of ways, if one German (it doesn't matter if he's the last one) makes it into your trench.  Apparently that's all it takes, even if you kill him a second after.  Then you have to run to another line and repeat the process and then go back and do it once more.  From then on, the campaign picks up.  You advance and clear out a town and your part in the Ardennes is over.  Nothing more worth mentioning, really.Berlin will satsify those are obsessed with sniping as it's pretty much laid out for that.  Long ranges, rubble, unsuspecting Germans, you get a nice Russian semi-automatic sniper rifle.  I prefer the Mosin Nagant (even more so because I actually own one in real life.)  You'll get to blow up some tanks with sticky bombs and 88mm artillery cannons.  You steal the plans then the game takes a course for the bizarre.  You'll find yourself controlling a Russian T-34 all by yourself.  At least in Allied Assault, you had a team, but this is ridiculous.  That means you drive the tank and operate the gun (that is loading, firing and aiming) all by yourself with your head outside the turret (!!!).  That's one well trained soldier.  Then you fight your way back to where you started with the Russian guys I neglected to mention earlier where there's a (suprise) large dramatic tank battle.  When you win, it's all over.  Painfull short, not that great.The multiplayer is where Spearhead really shines.  It really makes up for Allied Assault's mediocre multiplayer by adding new modes of play (Tug of War which is a more flexible kind of Objective match, really) maps, skins, weapons, etc...  Being able whack people with nearly every single weapon instead of just pistols is nice.  The Russian PPSH is very nice for short ranges (near bottomless clip) and gives Allies the chance to use bolt-action rifles if they want.  Replacing the shotgun for the Germans is the much whined about rifle grenade which is really fun to use.  Even though players claim it is the same a the rocket launcher, it's not.  You're more of a rifleman (it's just a Mauser Kar 98k that can fire a grenade at an arc at longer distances than you can throw a hand grenade.)

Here's What I think of this game:Graphics 10/10:Wow, if you have a PC that alows you to play MOH:AA on all the high settings, then you'll be blown away with the detail in every level. Weather it's the scared look on a fellow rangers face or the smoke from a recently fired Kar 98 Sniper Rifle, everything looks real. There are very few things that ever look amiss in the game.Sound 8/10:Don't get me wrong, the sounds is really good. You can here soldiers wispering, wimpering, rain falling, defining explosions, far off gun fire, taunts, and pretty much all sounds that you'd expect in a WW2 game. But, and yes there is a but, the game tends to have a few sound gliches. For instance, in parts of the game, you'll fire a weapon and there will be no sound. You'll here the bullet hit what ever it is you shot at, but there wont be a &quot;BANG&quot; when you press the fire button. There are other similare problems, weather its a bug in the game or what, im not sure. But what i really like is how the weather effects, muffle rifle shots. So when hidding, knowing there are enemy snipers around you, you're left wondering if it was a gun shot you hear or distant clap thunder. At points in the game, it gets really intense.Single Player Mission Structure 11/10:Perfect. Simply perfect. The missions are very well done. From North Aferica to Norway to France to Germany, you'll be leading ranger squads, sabotaging German equipment, infiltrating German HQ, and you even get to drive a KING TIGER TANK. The D-DAY mission is by far the best level I've every played in a FPS, followed up by the mission where you're a sniper and are sneaking around a bombed out French village, taking out opposing snipers. What I also enjoyed was how you'd be awarded medals for doing secret objectives (e.g. destroying a group of Tanks)Weapons 10/10:In this game you're givin a wide range of different guns and granades, all look and sound really good. You can use the Colt. 45, OSS Hi-Standard Silenced Pistol, M1 Garand (best rifle in the game) Springfeild '03 Sniper Rifle, Thompson SMG,  the BAR, Mark 2 Frag Granades, Bazooka, Winchester Shotgun, .30 CAL Mounted Machine Gun, Walther P38, Mauser KAR 98K, MP40, KAR 98 Sniper Rifle, STG44 STURMGEWHR, MG42 Mounted Machine Gun, Stielhandgrenate and the Panzershreck.Muliplayer 7/10:It isnt bad, but nothing new. You have your free for all, team death match, round based match and objective based match. The maps are good and are very detailed; giving you a real sense of fighting on the WW2 front.Realism 9/10:This games about as real as your going to get. The soldiers on both sides where the appropriate uniforms, say and do the logical thing when attacked and suprised, your team mates arnt completely useless (unlike other FPS like all Delta Force games) and theres depth in what the characters say. Soldiers will cry out with emotion and bark orders with rage, non sound as if there being read from a script. However, your team mates aiming isnt that accurate. For and example, there points in the game where a German soldier will be right infront of fellow ranger.  Both will shoot at each other and both will miss, even if there face to face. Also, on the D-Day level, theres a Medic on the beach who has a Colt pistol strapped onto his side. In any armed force, now and then, Medics werent aloud to carry wapons. These things are small and dont really effect the game much, unless your a realism freak or a history buff.Overall 10/10:Worth its weight in gold. BUY IT!

I am reposting my review from the PC Download section (I believe these two sections should be combined, it's the same game) to counter some of the negative reviews which I suspect is not on the up and up. Everyone has an opinion as long as it's honest. I would hate to have this game not do well because of misinformation (e.g. dumbed down combat, no party interaction, less complexity).** This review was made on normal and nightmare difficulty; Normal = DAO Casual **I am a fan of both Baldur's Gate and Dragon Age Origins but dislike Mass Effect 1 and 2 due to its party combat. So read this review with that in mind. I am writing this initial review for fans who may want to consider purchasing the game but are undecided due to the overhauls Bioware made to it. I have played 12 hours of the PS3 version (friend worked at a certain video game store and got it early) and 6 hours of the PC version. I will indicate the differences between the two as well as update the review once I actually beat it once.Gameplay *****This is where DA2 really shines. I thought one of the weakest element of Origins was in the tactical combat element of the game, namely it wasn't difficult at all once you level up or the game breaking abilities of certain class. Like Mass Effect, Origins was completely unbalanced. That game started off difficult but then progressively got easier due to the enemies not being able to keep up with your character. The mage in the original game if specced correctly would become near invincible by end game. You absolutely did not require tactics to beat the game, even on nightmare (OK, maybe I'm exaggerating a bit). Oh yeah, did I mention no cooldown on potions which made the challenge moot? How can you lose with basically unlimited health?Bioware has finally fixed this issue in the gameplay. Playing on hard on the PS3 DA2 version I continuously got party wiped at certain encounters in Kirkwall due to overwhelming forces (enemies spawn in waves) and the inability to plan tactically with the controller and limited interface. The cooldown on potions has ramped up the difficulty quite a bit. Bioware indicated that hard on DA2 = normal on Origins. Nothing can be further from the truth. Multiple waves of enemies plus potion and heal spell cooldown make fights extremely tactical and difficult. On the PC, it's a bit easier due to the ability to micromanage your party.This brings me to the next issue with the console version, it's almost impossible to play tactical without a good overhead mode. The mouse and keyboard on the PC is far easier to click through your battle plan while the better overhead view allows you see farther out. Unfortunately the camera is always locked on your selected character. This is a fail on Bioware. They need to release the camera and let it go free. Nevertheless, with the more tactical view and keyboard and mouse, hard mode is quite a bit easier on the PC than the console. On the PC I managed to keep all three of my characters at the intial level survive the first Ogre battle without a single death and only one health and one mana potion used, but Ion the console, I usually win with only my mage running in circles and the rest of the party wiped.Hit A to attack on the console is actually pretty fun. I can't imagine playing using auto attack with the controller (which btw is not implemented in the release, it may need to be patched for this). Unfortunately, hard mode is overly difficulty for button mashers. I would not want to play the console version in anything higher than normal.Story *** (so far, will update)So far, I like the initial story more than Origins. My favorite back-story from Origins was the human noble. It had elements of tragedy and revenge which helped in giving you a reason going forward with the story. I can finish a bad game with a great story (Mafia 2) but I simply cannot finish a good game with a bad story. Gameplay-wise, most games get repetitive after about 20 hours. Without a good story to push you forward, then you're simply going through the motion.So far the game lacks a strong central antagonist. I'm not talking about a nameless evil like the first game. Good story telling requires a compelling protagonist, antagonist, and pathos. 12 hours in, it's missing the antagonist portion. The darkspawn is too generic and it's over after one year. The fact that your sibling gets killed by a random Darkspawn, well, Bioware missed a good opportunity here. You just killed his murderer... and then the blight was over quickly. So what's the point of the game? Gaining fame and fortune, rags to riches has less appeal than a good revenge story.A scheming, backstabbing, machiavellian baron is a far better antagonist than a boring nameless evil enemy that you only get to see for the first time at the end of the game..then you promptly kill him. However, I will give this story a chance to surprise me.Interface ****They have streamlined the interface quite a bit. The inventory is manageable. You know which items are trash so you can just sell it without wondering what it is. This is a huge improvement over the craptastic Origins inventory. Everything else is good except for the limited armor for your companions. Look, Bioware, if you want the outfit to stay the same for each character, that's fine. However, let us find loot that upgrades it. For example, how about a fabric slot, a gauntlet slot, a boot slot, and an armor slot that is upgradeable but doesn't overly changes the way the armor look? Right now, you can only purchase slight upgrades from merchants which upgrades it 4 times over the course of the game. Automatic upgrade via level is lame, lame, lame. Not being able to equip armor for NPC's is especially lame since inventory management is half the fun of RPG's. For some NPC's, the weapons are also locked as well. For example, I found a bow that is much better than Bianca (72 damage vs 49) but I couldn't equip it on Varric because he only uses Bianca. What? If NPC's are going to have their own weapon, at least have it level to a comparable level to found loot!Damage numbers and status condition can be turned on in the options. I highly recommend this be the first thing turned on when you get the game. I'm glad this is still available.The rest of the interface is just too minimalist. I think this is due to the memory footprint for consoles. Luckily for PC's, modding will (hopefully) take care of this.Graphics ***The characters are all modeled very well. However, the backgrounds lack the polygons. This is most likely due to the weaker console capabilities. The PC version got the shaft on this. On the plus side, if you have a middling PC, then this game will likely work well for you. And it works on the very long in the tooth Xbox and PS3 consoles. The graphics is serviceable and I'm not too hung up on it. What matters is it's fun. There's always the Witcher 2 for the graphics department.Gameplay *****This is where DA2 really shines.

There's always the Witcher 2 for the graphics department.Class Balance *****Bioware has balanced their new classes well. Although there are only three base classes, there are numerous permutations that can come out of it. For example, the Rogue can specialize in both archery and dual wielding. Archery is slower but higher damage per attack. Duel wielding has higher DPS but the downside is that you have to get close to the enemy. Rogues are primarily damage dealers. They are also the only class that can open locks and release traps.Mages are as ridiculously powerful in the second as in the first. They are are used for damaging and crowd control. Mages have the most varied specialization as they can focus in elemental, force, healer, or crowd control. Mages are arguably the most fun class.Warriors are the weakest in terms of damaging power but probably the most indispensable of the three. They specialize in crowd control by keeping enemies off of the rogue and mages. They are damage soaker, good at "tanking." If the warrior dies, your party will most likely fall as well.For DA2, Bioware has added cross class combos. Each class has a certain status inducing attack that the other two can exploit. This is a very cool new feature but unfortunately only higher level characters can exploit. Stagger, brittle, etc. are impossible to perform with lower level abilities.Final Verdict ***** for PC, **** for console (may change once I finish the game)For those who compare the combat in this game to Diablo, nothing can be further from the truth. This is truly a tactical party RPG, more similar to Baldur's Gate on the higher difficulty level than Origins. For those who consider this game as the Mass Effect-ification of Dragon Age, you're partly right. The streamlining of the story, party members and interface are very similar to Mass Effect. However, the combat absolutely did not get the Mass Effect treatment. The party combats in Mass Effect 1/2 were a joke. You're basically a one man army in Mass Effect 1 and 2 with party members as side shows and ornaments than real. It was possible to play Mass Effect as a single person shooter by disregarding party members altogether. That is not true at all in Dragon Age 2. If you do not understand the art of tanking and crowd control, on hard or higher you will party wipe.It sounds like I'm being overly critical yet gave it a five star anyway. The reason is that the ultimate judge of game is did I enjoy the game? Yes, it's the most enjoyable game I played since Dragon Age Origins. I much prefer this game over both Origins and Mass Effect 2 due to its overhauled combat systems. This game on the PC is closer to a 5 than a 4. For the console versions, something is missing--namely the precise control for tactical combat. If you're considering this game, I recommend the PC version if you can run it. Otherwise, the console version is a fine game as well, minus one star.Update: Added Class Balance
I am someone who loved DA:O and wrote a glowing review on it. Frankly I liked DA2 more and find it hard now to go back to DA:O anymore. I just don't really understand the hate for this game but than everyone is entitled to their views. When I play games I am looking for some good, fun times and really not any kind of serious challenges or overly complex tactical scenarios maybe because my real life already has all that and games to me are mechanism of fun escapism and DA2 fits the bill here perfectly.  I am currently on my second play through as a mage and it's again fun so far playing a different class and I am not bored or anything.I do think however that Bioware kind of fumbled really bad on the marketing of this game. This is not a true sequel but rather a stand alone rpg set in the world of DA:O. They are references to the events of DA:O but the whole plot of the game is independent; kind of like a spin-off tv or movie series. I guess if they would have positioned the game correctly it may not have suffered the kind of wrath it did. Now that being said the game in my view has been trashed sometimes unfairly bordering on hate for the sake of hate just because it's not a clone of DA:O.A lot has been said on this game so I am going to keep my review concise and highlight what I liked and disliked about the game. The game does have some Cons but the Pros far exceed them.PRO's:1) The graphic engine (with the high texture patch) is leagues ahead of the original. The buildings, interiors, exteriors, dungeons, armor, cut-scenes etc. look beautifully rendered and highly detailed in my view.2) The voiced protagonist lends a more cinematic and personal feel to the game. One of my complaints with the original game was the disconnect I felt with my silent Grey Warden and DA:O to me felt backwards coming to play it after ME2. The conversation wheel in my view makes it more stream-lined to follow the story of the quest and it is much more intriguing to see what Hawke will actually say which lends to a more cinematic feel.3) The story line of the game feels more personal as it is the story of Hawke rising to fame & glory from rags. It doesn't have the epic feel of clear-cut good vs evil fight of the original but it does appeal to me more in the form of my (Hawke) story line amidst all the political and other schemes going on.4) The combat system is indeed a real improvement over DA:O. I many times thought of giving up on DA:O just because the combat was slow, sluggish and boring. DA2 combat is lot more fun, faster plus the animations are real good, and funny sometimes (I can never have enough of those exploding enemies hehe). Playing a warrior in DA2 was lot more fun than it was in the original.5) The banter between the companions is back and is better than ever. Try to put Isabella with other ladies and hear the amusing fireworks. Sometimes it's quite fun to be had. :)CONS:1) Repeated use of the same maps. Initially it doesn't matter much but as you are in Act 2 and up you do begin to notice this. Frankly DA:O used the same recycled maps in most interior dungeons but the game did had us travel to different locations which eased the fact that interior dungeons were recycled. I think in DA2 having the player just stay in and near Kirkwall exacerbated this feeling greatly. I hope in DA3 Bioware really pays attention to this fact.2) Limited ability to equip the party members. I am 50/50 on it. In DA:O though initially i liked dressing up my party members but later it just became a irritating hassle. I am somewhat glad they toned it down in DA2 but i think they toned it down too much. I think I should be allowed to equip my party members with basic armor and weapons of all kind without any restrictions. Bioware should address this too in DA3.3)A bit too overt gay angles in the game. I mean it looks like almost all male characters wants to start a romance while it takes quite a effort to work on the females party members (except Isabella ofcourse). Very soon whether it was the optimal configuration or not my team members were all females hehe.In all I ended my journey of DA2 on a happier note, felt my money spent was worth it and looking forward to DLC's and DA3.  Now if Bioware can combine what made DA2 great like the voiced protagonist, the new combat system with DA:O epic story line and customization options they might make amends to the offended fan base and have a hit rpg once again.
Well I just got done with the game (ah the joys of the long 4th of July weekend). I am someone who loved DA:O and wrote a glowing review on it. Frankly I liked DA2 more and find it hard now to go back to DA:O anymore. I just don't really understand the hate for this game but than everyone is entitled to their views. When I play games I am looking for some good, fun times and really not any kind of serious challenges or overly complex tactical scenarios maybe because my real life already has all that and games to me are mechanism of fun escapism and DA2 fits the bill here perfectly. I am currently on my second play through as a mage and it's again fun so far playing a different class and I am not bored or anything.I think Bioware kind of fumbled really bad on the marketing of this game. This is not a true sequel but rather a stand alone rpg set in the world of DA:O. They are references to the events of DA:O but the whole plot of the game is independent; kind of like a spin-off tv or movie series. I guess if they would have positioned the game correctly it may not have suffered the kind of wrath it did. Now that being said the game in my view has been trashed sometimes unfairly bordering on hate for the sake of hate just because it's not a clone of DA:O.A lot has been said on this game so I am going to keep my review concise and highlight what I liked and disliked about the game. The game does have some Cons but the Pros far exceed them.PRO's:1) The graphic engine (with the high texture patch) is leagues ahead of the original. The buildings, interiors, exteriors, dungeons, armor, cut-scenes etc. look beautifully rendered and highly detailed in my view.2) The voiced protagonist lends a more cinematic and personal feel to the game. One of my complaints with the original game was the disconnect I felt with my silent Grey Warden and DA:O to me felt backwards coming to play it after ME2. The conversation wheel in my view makes it more stream-lined to follow the story of the quest and it is much more intriguing to see what Hawke will actually say which lends to a more cinematic feel.3) The story line of the game feels more personal as it is the story of Hawke rising to fame & glory from rags. It doesn't have the epic feel of clear-cut good vs evil fight of the original but it does appeal to me more in the form of my (Hawke) story line amidst all the political and other schemes going on.4) The combat system is indeed a real improvement over DA:O. I many times thought of giving up on DA:O just because the combat was slow, sluggish and boring. DA2 combat is lot more fun, faster plus the animations are real good, and funny sometimes (I can never have enough of those exploding enemies hehe). Playing a warrior in DA2 was lot more fun than it was in the original.5) The banter between the companions is back and is better than ever. Try to put Isabella with other ladies and hear the amusing fireworks. Sometimes it's quite fun to be had. :)CONS:1) Repeated use of the same maps. Initially it doesn't matter much but as you are in Act 2 and up you do begin to notice this. Frankly DA:O used the same recycled maps in most interior dungeons but the game did had us travel to different locations which eased the fact that interior dungeons were recycled. I think in DA2 having the player just stay in and near Kirkwall exacerbated this feeling greatly. I hope in DA3 Bioware really pays attention to this fact.2) Limited ability to equip the party members. I am 50/50 on it. In DA:O though initially i liked dressing up my party members but later it just became a irritating hassle. I am somewhat glad they toned it down in DA2 but i think they toned it down too much. I think I should be allowed to equip my party members with basic armor and weapons of all kind without any restrictions. Bioware should address this too in DA3.3) A bit too overt gay angles in the game. I mean it looks like almost all male characters wants to start a romance while it takes quite a effort to work on the females party members (except Isabella ofcourse). Very soon whether it was the optimal configuration or not my team members were all females hehe.In all I ended my journey of DA2 on a happier note, felt my money spent was worth it and looking forward to DLC's and DA3. Now if Bioware can combine what made DA2 great like the voiced protagonist, the new combat system with DA:O epic story line and customization options they might make amends to the offended fan base and have a hit rpg once again.
I am a fan of both Baldur's Gate and Dragon Age Origins but dislike Mass Effect 1 and 2 due to its party combat. So read this review with that in mind. I am writing this initial review for fans who may want to consider purchasing the game but are undecided due to the overhauls Bioware made to it. I have played 12 hours of the PS3 version (friend worked at a certain video game store and got it early) and 6 hours of the PC version. I will indicate the differences between the two as well as update the review once I actually beat it once. ** This review was made on hard and nightmare difficulty; Normal = DAO Casual **Gameplay *****This is where DA2 really shines. I thought one of the weakest element of Origins was in the tactical combat element of the game, namely it wasn't difficult at all once you level up or the game breaking abilities of certain class. Like Mass Effect, Origins was completely unbalanced. That game started off difficult but then progressively got easier due to the enemies not being able to keep up with your character. The mage in the original game if specced correctly would become near invincible by end game. You absolutely did not require tactics to beat the game, even on nightmare (OK, maybe I'm exaggerating a bit). Oh yeah, did I mention no cooldown on potions which made the challenge moot? How can you lose with basically unlimited health?Bioware has finally fixed this issue in the gameplay. Playing on hard on the PS3 DA2 version I continuously got party wiped at certain encounters in Kirkwall due to overwhelming forces (enemies spawn in waves) and the inability to plan tactically with the controller and limited interface. The cooldown on potions has ramped up the difficulty quite a bit. Bioware indicated that hard on DA2 = normal on Origins. Nothing can be further from the truth. Multiple waves of enemies plus potion and heal spell cooldown make fights extremely tactical and difficult. On the PC, it's a bit easier due to the ability to micromanage your party.This brings me to the next issue with the console version, it's almost impossible to play tactical without a good overhead mode. The mouse and keyboard on the PC is far easier to click through your battle plan while the better overhead view allows you see farther out. Unfortunately the camera is always locked on your selected character. This is a fail on Bioware. They need to release the camera and let it go free. Nevertheless, with the more tactical view and keyboard and mouse, hard mode is quite a bit easier on the PC than the console. On the PC I managed to keep all three of my characters at the intial level survive the first Ogre battle without a single death and only one health and one mana potion used, but Ion the console, I usually win with only my mage running in circles and the rest of the party wiped.Hit A to attack on the console is actually pretty fun. I can't imagine playing using auto attack with the controller (which btw is not implemented in the release, it may need to be patched for this). Unfortunately, hard mode is overly difficulty for button mashers. I would not want to play the console version in anything higher than normal.Story *** (so far, will update)So far, I like the initial story more than Origins. My favorite back-story from Origins was the human noble. It had elements of tragedy and revenge which helped in giving you a reason going forward with the story. I can finish a bad game with a great story (Mafia 2) but I simply cannot finish a good game with a bad story. Gameplay-wise, most games get repetitive after about 20 hours. Without a good story to push you forward, then you're simply going through the motion.So far the game lacks a strong central antagonist. I'm not talking about a nameless evil like the first game. Good story telling requires a compelling protagonist, antagonist, and pathos. 12 hours in, it's missing the antagonist portion. The darkspawn is too generic and it's over after one year. The fact that your sibling gets killed by a random Darkspawn, well, Bioware missed a good opportunity here. You just killed his murderer... and then the blight was over quickly. So what's the point of the game? Gaining fame and fortune, rags to riches has less appeal than a good revenge story.A scheming, backstabbing, machiavellian baron is a far better antagonist than a boring nameless evil enemy that you only get to see for the first time at the end of the game..then you promptly kill him. However, I will give this story a chance to surprise me.Interface ****They have streamlined the interface quite a bit. The inventory is manageable. You know which items are trash so you can just sell it without wondering what it is. This is a huge improvement over the craptastic Origins inventory. Everything else is good except for the limited armor for your companions. Look, Bioware, if you want the outfit to stay the same for each character, that's fine. However, let us find loot that upgrades it. For example, how about a fabric slot, a gauntlet slot, a boot slot, and an armor slot that is upgradeable but doesn't overly changes the way the armor look? Right now, you can only purchase slight upgrades from merchants which upgrades it 4 times over the course of the game. Automatic upgrade via level is lame, lame, lame. Not being able to equip armor for NPC's is especially lame since inventory management is half the fun of RPG's. For some NPC's, the weapons are also locked as well. For example, I found a bow that is much better than Bianca (72 damage vs 49) but I couldn't equip it on Varric because he only uses Bianca. What? If NPC's are going to have their own weapon, at least have it level to a comparable level to found loot!Damage numbers and status condition can be turned on in the options. I highly recommend this be the first thing turned on when you get the game. I'm glad this is still available.The rest of the interface is just too minimalist. I think this is due to the memory footprint for consoles. Luckily for PC's, modding will (hopefully) take care of this.Graphics ***The characters are all modeled very well. However, the backgrounds lack the polygons. This is most likely due to the weaker console capabilities. The PC version got the shaft on this. On the plus side, if you have a middling PC, then this game will likely work well for you. And it works on the very long in the tooth Xbox and PS3 consoles. The graphics is serviceable and I'm not too hung up on it. What matters is it's fun. There's always the Witcher 2 for the graphics department.Class Balance *****Bioware has balanced their new classes well. Although there are only three base classes, there are numerous permutations that can come out of it. For example, the Rogue can specialize in both archery and dual wielding. Archery is slower but higher damage per attack. Duel wielding has higher DPS but the downside is that you have to get close to the enemy. Rogues are primarily damage dealers. They are also the only class that can open locks and release traps.Mages are as ridiculously powerful in the second as in the first. They are are used for damaging and crowd control. Mages have the most varied specialization as they can focus in elemental, force, healer, or crowd control. Mages are arguably the most fun class.Warriors are the weakest in terms of damaging power but probably the most indispensable of the three. They specialize in crowd control by keeping enemies off of the rogue and mages. They are damage soaker, good at "tanking." If the warrior dies, your party will most likely fall as well.For DA2, Bioware has added cross class combos. Each class has a certain status inducing attack that the other two can exploit. This is a very cool new feature but unfortunately only higher level characters can exploit. Stagger, brittle, etc. are impossible to perform with lower level abilities.Final Verdict ***** for PC, **** for consoleFor those who compare the combat in this game to Diablo, nothing can be further from the truth. This is truly a tactical party RPG, more similar to Baldur's Gate on the higher difficulty level than Origins. For those who consider this game as the Mass Effect-ification of Dragon Age, you're partly right. The streamlining of the story, party members and interface are very similar to Mass Effect. However, the combat absolutely did not get the Mass Effect treatment. The party combats in Mass Effect 1/2 were a joke. You're basically a one man army in Mass Effect 1 and 2 with party members as side shows and ornaments than real. It was possible to play Mass Effect as a single person shooter by disregarding party members altogether. That is not true at all in Dragon Age 2. If you do not understand the art of tanking and crowd control, on hard or higher you will party wipe.It sounds like I'm being overly critical yet gave it a five star anyway. The reason is that the ultimate judge of game is did I enjoy the game? Yes, it's the most enjoyable game I played since Dragon Age Origins. I much prefer this game over both Origins and Mass Effect 2 due to its overhauled combat system. This game on the PC is closer to a 5 than a 4. For the console versions, something is missing--namely the precise control for tactical combat. If you're considering this game, I recommend the PC version if you can run it. Otherwise, the console version is a fine game as well, minus one star.Update: I've added the class balance section 3/9/11
I loved Dragon Age Origins. To bits. I had hoped that what had made DA:O great would be revisited in the highly anticipated sequel, DA2, but ...not quite. There was much to love about DA2, but not enough to make it great.The Plot -* Set in Thedas and the world of Dragon Age Origins. The game takes place in the Free Marches, a place mentioned during DA:O and occurs after the events of DA:O and it's expansion Awakenings. Your choices in those games affect the history and political setting in DA2, but not so much.  You are a refugee fleeing the Blight with your family in the year Dragon 30, while elsewhere in Fereldan the Grey Warden from Origins/Awakenings is busy killing darkspawn and archdemons and making kings. By Dragon 40, your story will have played out in the city-state of Kirkwall, and change the world of Thedas forever.* The Chantry, the church of Thedas, is in conflict with itself, and grants their Templars the task of protecting, imprisoning, indoctrinating, abducting, controlling or lobotomizing the Mages. Mages in turn are prisoners, lobotomized Tranquils, corrupted demon hosts/bloodmages or heretical sinners fleeing the long arm of the Chantry. It's not easy - the Chantry religion teaches people to fear mages, and mages themselves aren't much help since they often dabble with blood magic or dangerous spirits.* The Qunari are a people of very strict religious doctrine who, if possible, treat their mages with even more discipline and cruelty, but not much more than they do the people of other religions. A few hundred of them are visiting Kirkwall, and while there have been only a handful of scuffles, the very presence of these unsettling guests is the source of upheaval in the politics of Kirkwall and the Chantry.* Your Companions. You will collect a team of followers who you assist, and who assist you in turn during the events of the game. Some will be your best buddies, and some will be your respectful rivals. Not all of them will stick with you to the bitter end. Some agree with you, some disagree with you. They disagree with each other, as often as some seem to find common ground. I love the party banter between the companions that gives you a sense of their own relationships and personalities.* Your character - Hawke, the Champion of Kirkwall, and the one thing holding the Hawke/Amell family, the Companions and, eventually, Kirkwall, together. You will also be the one thing that can blow them all apart.--What's Good --- The art. Visually beautiful environments (especially with the free high quality texture pack) and outstanding artwork.- Companions make the game world more believable and anchor you to the experience, adding to the immersion.- Improved talent trees and level up mechanics- Love the animations and fight mechanics- Friend/Rival aspect (although it still felt just like the approval/disapproval of DAO)- The Grey Wardens and the Deep Roads- The story- The writing- The Voice actors- Like every other BioWare title I've played, there is high production quality and the game runs reliably and stably with relatively few/minor bugs. It's sad in the gaming industry that this is not always a given, but BioWare does deliver on that.-- What went Wrong --I can't fault BioWare their writing - just how it was put into motion.The game was surprisingly short, placing it somewhere between the length of Dragon Age Origins which can run 40 or so hours and it's expansion Awakening, which is about 20 hours. The main plot needed some extension so you might have more interaction with the politicals of Kirkwall, the Chantry leaders, and the Qunari Arishok. You spend the first year in Kirkwall in the blink of an eye - you join a faction to pay your way in but there is no consequence to one choice over another, and no quests beyond the initial one. You do have a goal to work towards in getting into an expedition that should ensure your position in Kirkwall, so Act 1 at least has a solid goal.  The Qunari are a distant threat that you aren't given a reason to worry about beyond prejudice.Act 2 is made up mostly of side quests, companion quests and other tasks. Anyone who did not play DAO and Awakenings would not get the gravity of the problem in DA2. There really could have been more quests devoted to filling out the main plot story and options. What happens in these years will change the world of Thedas forever... why not spend some more quest plotting to make you feel the weight of that decision? I think there are all of two quests in Act 1 and 2 concerning Patrice, a major player in the political events. The Qunari explode at the end of act, but you've hardly been given a tie in to know what's going on. As quickly as they have flared up, at the end of Act 2, they have fizzled out. Uhm... Consequences?Act 3 has at least one major character doing a sharp 180 degree turn from his behavior in Act 2. There is no option to affect the events that will take place because of it. There is no decision here at all to affect the crisis point, or even about how you will react to the events - its no spoiler to say you're gonna fight, and often the same people no matter what you choose. All that changes will be the fate of the character that performs the pivotal act, and what faction you will support in the end.--What was really annoying--It's been said before, but can't be repeated too often - which is very fitting considering what the complaint is ... Overused environment maps. Really - the same cave map exists everywhere in Sundermount, but just different passages are blocked off. I had to forever be in the Journal so I could remember what quest I was on - the underground ones most all looked like one of two maps. There are two house floorplans in all of Kirkwall - mansion or hovel, one warehouse, one seedy hideout, one underground passage. They just have different doors open or blocked off depending on which address you've gone to. What's that about, BioWare? It was very confusing.The companions are fun, but you really wanted to strangle most of them when it came to their personal quests. Choir-boy (Blind and faith really don't go together), Broody Elf (Get on with your life already!), Blondie (You need Help. Capital H. Now.), Daisy (IDIOT!!!), Ravaini (selfish little sociopath), ... even your own brother (jealous for 30 years... get over it!) - all needed a good throttling. Sadly the two sanest companions, Varric and Aveline, were off limits as far as romance subplots went, so you had less interaction with them than your crazier companions. Their in-party, and sometimes in-quest banter was full of win.Fights - I hated the pop-up thug dispenser that kept adding more enemies to any battle. Aside from feeling like the game was cheating by adding more folks in than were present at the start, it was often bugged. In order to complete some quests I had to exit and re-enter an area repeatedly until the dispenser had squeezed out what was at the bottom of the tube. Aside from the boss battle at the end of Act 2, there are no really wildly fun fights. Sigh. Also - the lack of a fully top down view of the battle field and limited camera distance, was only mildly annoying, but was a definite step back from the series predecessors.Considering we can expect a flurry of DLC to be released, which will no doubt fill out the game more, the price tag seems less than fair, especially after the $10 price hike for the "free" Signature Edition upgrade. The game has made me less likely to pre-order the next title in the series. If you get DA2 expecting the same level of awesome that you got from DA:O or Awakenings, it will be a disappointment.
Dragon Age: Origins Ultimate Edition1. Origins2. DLC3. Awakening1. ORIGINSBioware is one of the few developers that seem to deliver the seemingly impossible mixture between the harmony of deep storytelling and deep gameplay through a RPG genre. When other game developers seem to strive for this nirvana but continuously miss the mark it is all the more impressive to see this single RPG developer do it time and again. Back when it was thought that the RPG roots and rudimentary elements of the "good" RPG were dying out Bioware revitalized the RPG world with a defibrillation to the hearts of RPG lovers everywhere with the release of the Baldur's Gate franchise in the late 90's. Hallmarked as possibly one of the greatest RPGs of all time it raised some eyebrows when Bioware started to say "Dragon Age will be the spiritual successor to the Baldur's Gate franchise". As my score for the game may entail...SWEET PAJESUS, thank goodness they delivered. Sit through the chinwag and you'll learn a lot about the things that make Dragon Age so great, evolved, deep, linear while feeling open ended, immersive, and just plan addicting.The simple breakdown of "Dragon Age: Origins" is like so...Graphics/Character Performance and Animation - 8.5/10Fun Factor - 9/10Story - 10/10Controls- 9/10User Interfacing - 9/10Learning Curve - Hard to say...I am experienced with this gameplay style.Sound - 9/10Value - 10/10Total - 9.2 / 10Jump down to my "All in all" if you only want a brief summary. I have also put key-words in CAPS to indicate what the bulk of that specific paragraph is discussing to make the review easy to navigate to points of interest.So, you're starting Dragon Age: Origins for the first time and you've just clicked on "New Game". It has already begun. The game is already starting to reveal its deep level of RPG and CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS. When you first start you're going to have to choose from six different "Origins" stories. The prologue of the game is influenced by what type of protagonist you create right off the get-go. There are three races to choose from - Human, Elf, and Dwarf -- each with their own racial benefits. For example, Dwarfs are inherently unable to use magic thus cannot become a mage and in turn their racial ability gives them a 10% chance to have any hostile spell aimed at them fail to affect them. After your race has been chosen you must then pick one of three classes; rogue, warrior, or mage. So, you have your Dwarf rogue or warrior and then you have to pick between whether your beginnings take place as a noble or as a commoner. Other options include Humans and Elves that can become mages and no matter what choices are made mages end up with the same beginning in the Circle of Magi. No matter your chosen path of race, class, or hierarchy your origins beginning will set the mood for the rest of the game and connects you to your character and their races' way of life in the Dragon Age universe.The ORIGINS STORIES are what truly sets the stage for a genuine dark medieval fantasy universe. From the very beginning the ambience is dark and tragic. When starting as a Dalish Elf (nomad, druid-like forest dwelling elves that struggle to retain their long forgotten way of Elven life before becoming slaves to humans) you are patrolling the forest when you come across several Humans fleeing...something. When you meet one another you are both startled for different reasons. The humans are afraid of whatever is behind them and the elves are afraid that if the humans are left to continue their retreat they may tell other humans of the Dalishes' whereabouts which could endanger your loved ones and home location. You must then and there decide to kill the humans or not.When starting as a Dwarf noble you are the second born and favored son of the king of the Dwarven city of Orzammar. Your youngest brother tells you of your eldest brother's plans to have your father killed because your older brother can no longer wait to become king. Your eldest brother is murdered and you are framed for the deed. With the eldest brother murdered you are sentenced to be cast into the Deep Roads (Dark Spawn infested underground roadways) because there are far too little Dwarfs and to not have them at least die with some Dark Spawn blood on their hands would be a waste. Every origins story starts with and introduces you to this genuine dark medieval fantasy world.This dark medieval fantasy universe that feels somewhat familiar not only through similar fantasy worlds -- like Forgotten Realms or D&D; -- but also through true-to-life geographical-cultural and political nuances is an additional factor of Dragon Age's life-breath that gives it a heartbeat. For example, the neighboring nations of Ferelden and the Orlesian Empire were once warring over control of Ferelden until the Orlesians were driven out. Simple nuances like the Orlesians having a more French-esque accent really is one of the game's many finishing touches that just adds to its validity through this universe's fantasy yet displaying its tangibility through grounding realities. Orlias is not the only place that displays this level of thoroughness through detail. Zevran, for example, is a character from Antiva and sounds as though he could originate somewhere like Spain. These nuances -- some seemingly mundane or some that are pivotal to the immersion-- really add to this universe's complexities and are really what sell the game's otherwise traditional main story and take it somewhere extraordinary.The game's MAIN STORY takes hold after you have chosen your character's race, class, and hierarchy. One way or another, you're going to end in the recruitment vassalage of Ferelden's Grey Warden leader, Duncan. The properly named GREY Wardens do not have an allegiance to any specific realm or nation; they do not take hand in politics or strive for personal gain. The Grey Wardens have one duty that supersedes all other moral, ethical, political, racial, or monetary needs and that is...destroy the Dark Spawn. Wardens go where the Dark Spawn pose threat; whether it be the forests of the Dalish elves, the heart of the Tevinter Imperium, the land of Orlias, or the Dwarven cities of the Deep Roads. The Warden is born of Dark Spawn blood and they will die (hopefully covered) with it. And this origins story is no different. You and Duncan are headed straight for Ostagar where Duncan believes a true Blight is underhand.WHAT IS A BLIGHT you ask? Well, I am glad you asked. A Blight is made-up of many Dark Spawn. A Dark Spawn is a grotesque humanoid individual creature that is about as dangerous as you would imagine a blood crazed psychopath might be when armed with a sword...or magic. So, as an individual they're as easy to kill as any...blood crazed psychopath would be for a trained and battle-hardened combatant. Now these Dark Spawn individuals are quite literally...mindless idiots. The Dark Spawn individual always has a calling; something beckoning them to burrow. The Dark Spawn is always ravaging the earth to find what is calling them. This beckoning is from an Archdemon. The Archdemon is the keystone that holds the functionality of the Dark Spawn together. Once freed from their prisons under the earth's surface the Archdemon uses a type of telepathy to gather a Dark Spawn horde. The Archdemon puts initiative and coherence behind what is otherwise mindless psychopathary and turns the Dark Spawn into a wave of black, tainted, horrifying slaughter at the wake of the Archdemon's control. This driven darkness led by the twisted monstrosity that is an Archdemon is what is known as a Blight. And that is where you and Duncan are headed; straight to Ostagar where Duncan believes a true Blight is forming.After reaching the encampment of the obtuse portion that makes-up the vanguard that is OSTAGAR's hourglass design Duncan wants you to venture into the Korcari Wilds (forested wilderness) to retrieve some old, long absent treaties that promise aid to the Grey Wardens from many of the races of Ferelden in case of a Blight. You are also to bring back several vials of Dark Spawn blood. Retrieving the treaties and the blood is part of your initiation to the ranks of Grey Warden. After your initiation the Dark Spawn Blight is beginning to gather near the bottleneck of Ostagar's great forefronts. This is where the narrative yet again flexes its dark fantasy muscles as it is not all puppy dogs and flowers in this medieval fantasy universe. As the battle ensues...the accumulated forces of Ferelden crumble to the Dark Spawn's mighty Blight.As one of two remaining Grey Wardens it is your duty to use the treaties you gathered from the Korcari Wilds to gather and rally the races of Ferelden together to conquer the true Blight and sack the Archdemon.I know what you're thinking..."none of this sounds too original...a person who roams the country to gather an army for an impending war and must overcome the perplexities of racial and cultural barriers to unite them against an overwhelming foe?" And I would agree with you, but that is the beauty of the game. It is not the game's overarching storyline that generates newfound and engrossing narrative but the universe the tale takes place in instead. The world is filled with fascinating cultural nuances that are taboo, controversial, and simply interesting to learn about. And, after the battle of Ostagar you're going to get to explore those cultural nuances.This is when your true quest begins. The WORL MAP is now open revealing several different locations and the map adapts to the situation of the impending Blight war as it unfolds which details a blackness on map spreading as you progress through the game which originates at Ostagar's map marker to indicate the growth of the Blight's size and exodus from their underground labyrinths. Usually I hate when a game just simply has a map with markers and you only click on your desired location and you take no part in the adventure to said location. In the case of DA: Origins, the PLOT-POINT-TRAVEL is done in such a way that it doesn't feel like it should have been done any other way. This is how traveling works. Once you have chosen your destination your group is indicated by a dripping bloodstain that takes the roadway paths to your chosen locations. This bloodstain indication of your party will occasionally be stopped mid-travel and be put in a battle scenario against bandits, assassins, stray Dark Spawn, maybe even just a simple traveling merchant, and a number of different random situations. The addition of combat mid-travel makes the travel system not feel hollow. Also, if the game were to have an "on foot" type of travel execution the game most likely would have only felt like it was putting you into trivial fighting situations during an "on foot" excursion to your destination. So, take it from someone who basically hates plot-pointed-travel systems...it is done very well in this game.The map marks pivotal locations and you will adventure to some great ENVIRONEMENTS. The surroundings themselves can be quite fantastic in this fantasy world. The ambiences that surround you will have a diverse range of their uniqueness from place to place. From the step drops of Redcliff and their lakeside view or the towering Elvan construct turned Circle of Magi Tower these places will entice you to investigate what rests within. One of my favorite is perhaps the subterranean mountain dwelling inhabitance of the Dwarven city of Orzammar. The dwarfs seem to have almost...irrigated streams of magma to illuminate their underground city. Streams of lava cascade down handcrafted lavaways giving their city a very orange and intense feeling. Though some of the cities can feel a bit "stiff" when it comes to the liveliness of the NPCs who inhabit them and their goings-on, yet it is a great mix between feeling constructed and statuesque while still giving a breath of life to these major location's realisms.These mapped pivotal locations will lead you to and through the game's main overarching narrative. The main plot is not where the narrative or adventures of this universe stop.There are SIDE QUESTS spewing from this game that are not all simple or lack intrigue. They can be quite the opposite and are abundantly placed in major locations. These side quests are uniformly given by several "hush-hush" or publicized organizations - like the Mages' Collective, Chantry Boards, and The Blackstone Irregulars - not to mention the randomly found quest from all over that don't tie into one of these groups and your companion's personal tales which can lead to some of the game's most interesting quest lines. There is a ton to do here and many ways to go about doing it.This is because of DECISIONS AND DIALOGUE OPTIONS. Dragon Age: Origins has many pivotal events happening in the present history of the world while the Blight is looming down on the occupants of Ferelden. Decision making and dialogue options play a big part into the game and you have much influence over shaping the world around you through momentous events in your history making actions taken. Through game choice you'll decide the fate of cultures and people's lives hang in the balance more often than not. Your character does not have an actor's voice, but that does not mean your protagonist is silent. Every dialogue choice is spoken word-for-word and people react to everything you say. Depending on what you've done or said to people their tone of voice could change to excitement while engaging in conversation with you or possibly even evolve to distain. Your actions and words both speak loud in this game and have cause and effect become a noticeable reality after your chosen decisions and dialogue.Dragon Age: Origins' character performance and dialogue delivery is stellar and deserves a 10 / 10, but the mundane graphics through stiff facial animations, a drab muted color palette, and occasional graphical texture issues drag the game's otherwise outstanding VISUAL PERFORMANCE down to a an 8.5. Combat animations run flawlessly smooth, but there are not many. You have some animations for your traditional sword swings, arms spread open and back arched for that "shouting" talent (taunting), backstabbing, and the mage basically only lifts their staff into the air for every spell. So, the combat animations go through the motions very fluently yet there is only a handful to be seen. On the other hand, there are some stylishly blood splatteringly entertaining gladiatorial "finishers" that one of your characters may go through at the very end of an enemy's health. You may criss-cross slash them several times on the chest making them spin in the process, stab stomach and decapitate with your other weapon, or shield bash and stab simultaneously for a very quick and satisfying fatality. These finisher moves are quick and they do not disturb the flow of combat. Another visual aspect is that the inventory UI is beautifully crafted, easy to navigate, intuitively quick to response, but is by far more complimenting to all of these qualities on the PC version. Every inventory icon is lovingly crafted for each individual item in the game...and there is a TON of items.This brings me to the other side of the RPG coin and away from the universe and the narrative of Dragon Age: Origins and I arrive at the other deeply satisfying aspects of this wonderful RPG game; the deep gameplay.Origins' plethora of ITEMS AND GEAR is second to none. The game supports A LOT of gear and items from herbalism plants, wolf hides, fantasy materials - like Lyrium, Frost Spheres, Fire Crystal, etc. - to trap triggers, metal shards, and armor of all shapes and sizes. Your character's equipable gear slots are broken down like so. Every controllable character has two weapon sets they can swap at any given time. A weapon set consists of an off-hand slot and a main-hand slot. The archetype categories for WEAPONS are broke into melee, ranged, magic, and defensive. For melee weapons you have one-handed weapons like daggers, swords, and axes and for two-handed weapons you have swords and hammers. For ranged weapons you have short and log bows and crossbows. Defensive is broken into bucklers (small shields) and large wood and large metal shields. For magical there are staves. Damaging weapons can have up to a maximum of three-open-sockets for runes. RUNES are special little rocks that go into a weapon's socket to enhance the item's abilities. These enhancement runes have a wide range of benefits to adding different types of elemental damage or to adding physical resistance or possibly having a chance to paralyze foes on hit. The runes are broken into tiers of varying potency with five different levels of strength for each individual effect. For example, a "Novice Frost" rune will add +1 frost damage to your weapon whereas a "Grand Master Frost" rune will add +5 damage. There are also differently tiered runes in between to fill the 1-5+ frost damage void. Then there are gear slots for two rings, a belt, and a necklace which make-up the game's "ACCESSORY" slots. Then there are the actual ARMOR gear slots which are comprised of an armor slot for a helmet, gloves, boots, and chest piece. When dealing with armor parts you can get an item set bonus if you're wearing 4/4 of a specific set. For example, when wearing all of the "studded leather" parts in each armor slot you will get a "set bonus" of extra benefits in addition to the stat increases the armor may already enhance. Also, all armor and weapons can be wielded by any character that is attributed correctly with stat points for the item's requirements. Like a mage can wield a sword or wear massive full plate if they have enough strength.This brings me to STATS AND ATTRIBUTES. Each level gained you're going to get to distribute three attribute points and one skill tree point. These stats have varying different effects and are more useful for one class to the next. These attribute stats that enhance your character are Strength, Dexterity, Willpower, Magic, Cunning, and Constitution. Attributes have different degrees of effects like; melee/ranged weapon damage output, deepen stamina/mana pools to activate talents, increase spell damage and intensity, and increase the character's Health pool. Besides needing a specific amount of strength to wield a weapon or wear armor you may also need an aptitude of say dexterity or magic to be able to pick a specific talent from your skill trees. For example, "Device Mastery IV" will require 22 cunning, "Death Cloud" 34 magic, or 12 dexterity to obtain "Dual-Weapon Training". So, attribute distribution is very important to creating the character you want and obtaining the skill tree talents you want.Each class has a default set of SKILL TREES at their disposal as well as some trees that are universal to weapons and not just class. The ROGUE AND WARRIOR, for example, have an identical 3x4 skill tree that is for Dual Weapon mastery and for Archery. In addition, the warrior also has a Sword and Shield mastery and Two-handed weapon mastery where the rogue does not. The Warrior's signature tree includes things like "Threaten" which helps keep enemies focused on the warrior and "Bravery" which influences the warrior's damage, critical percentage, and attack rating which is all increased due to how many enemies the warrior is engaging over the number of two. The rogue also has a signature tree which includes things like lock picking, feign death, backstab improvements, and stealth.THE MAGE is unique and shares no skill trees in common with the other two classes. The mage is also the only class with the ability to heal their allies. The mage has something like 4-5 different "schools" of magic trees to choose from which are all 4x4. For example, "Primal" is a school of magic that has things that are elemental in nature like; "Cone of Cold", "Fire Weapons", and "Chain Lightning" whereas the "Entropy" tree has things that are more along the lines of curses like; "Vulnerability Hex", "Mass Paralyze", and "Death Cloud". The classes' default talent trees have a wide variety in builds and leave a lot up to the player to decide their character's unique build due to a range of talent tree flexibility.Besides the different classes' default skill trees there are also SPECIALIZATION SKILL BRANCHES. Specialization options are linked to the character's base class-warrior, mage, and rogue-and each character can have up to two specializations. Most companions whom join the party have one specialization pre-selected and are thus able to take one more. You are awarded a specialization skill point at level 7 and 14. All specializations require unlocking through a trainer (a person who can teach it), a manual (purchased from a store), or a plot event. Specializations can be unlocked at any level and will stay unlocked on subsequent replays. Thus, it is possible, before making a decision that will get you a specialization but will cause approval loss from party members, to save, unlock the specialization and then revert to the save before the approval loss and still have the specialization unlocked.Each class-rogue, warrior, and mage-has four different specializations to choose from. Assassin, Dualist, Ranger, and Bard for the rogue; Templar, Reaver, Berserker, and Champion for the warrior and finally Blood mage, Arcane Warrior, Shape Shifter, and Spirit Healer for the mage. Each specialization has a set of four different talents and a passive attribute bonus when initiated for said character. The specializations are where a lot of the game's diversity and deep character-party customization comes into play. With your created character's choice of two different specializations and the ability to pick at least one of every individual's second specialization for the companions you acquire on your adventure it is very interesting to see the different ways you can build a party-character to feed off of each other's abilities and builds.Less frequently when leveling you will get PROFICIENCY TREE points or "skills". How often you receive these points depends on the character's class. Rogues get them the most often which is every other level. I believe warriors get them every three levels and mages every four, but I am not certain. Proficiency skills are things like Coercion (helps you persuade people in conversations to agree with what you want), stealing, combat prowess (necessary to unlock abilities farther in skill trees), tactics (allow you to set-up more AI for your characters and their abilities), and crafting skills such as; Herbalism (potion crafting), Poison Brewing (bombs and weapon coatings), and Trap Making.Between all of these deep character customizations of armor, stats, weapons, skill trees, specialization skills, and proficiencies and then to compound it all with a group of four...it can leave an extremely malleable combat and role playing experience that is deep, extremely versatile, and very satisfying. On the other hand, if all of this sounds too in depth for you and or complex you can always just click on the "auto-level" which will distribute your stats, talents, proficiencies, and specializations for you across your characters when they level up so you don't have to.After adding all of these elements of character customization together it is time to put them into the game's functional execution and test Origins' COMBAT. First off, I have to emphasize that this is NOT an action game. Sure, it has great action visually, but you are not going to be smashing buttons and pulling off button combinations to wreak havoc like in "DMC" or "God of War". That is not what this game is about. Dragon Age: Origins is about quick thinking, tactical, and situational combat scenarios. It plays more like an MMO. You pick your target you want to go attack and then you use your skill tree talents to execute certain skills and then you auto-attack while those skills are on cool-down. On the other hand though, what makes it different than MMOs is that you can "pause-to-pick-talents" and stop time to carryout certain abilities across your filled to capacity four-person team. Thus, you're not just sitting there waiting for your skills to be off cool-down because you have to micromanage your entire team...or at least set-up decent "tactics" through those proficiency skills I mention earlier to improve the AI of your team. So, if you've ever played a MMO like World of Warcraft that is probably the best absent but associated experience to draw a parallel from. Group combat mechanics are about "Tanking", Damage, Healing, and --more often than not you're outnumbered-crowd control. The combat feels a bit like you're in an MMO dungeon but you're in control of your whole party. Cool-down timers, pause-to-pick talents, potion chugs, and tactically strategic combat scenarios make this experience feel a lot like a single-player version of an online community-based dungeon crawler.HUD details - Health, mana, stamina, of your created or currently controlled character will be down at the bottom right for Xbox. A Mass Effect-style Radial menu on the Xbox can be used to execute skill tree talents or you can have assigned abilities to X, B, Y and RT+X, B, and Y for quick access to 6 skill talents. A "Hot Bar" takes the place of this on the PC version. There is no "plot-point-to-move" ability on Xbox version. On the PC you can choose a character then a "move" icon and then point and click your cursor where you would like that character move to; all while in that "paused time interface". On the Xbox, instead you have to try and do a "hold position" command and move them individually before combat. During combat are the same bad issues, you cannot pick a character then have them execute a move across the map unless under your direct control which makes micro management and movement during combat an extreme hassle and a dangerous one at that.LEARNING CURVE- Like I said before; it is hard for me to say because I have experience with this type of gameplay and character creation/build depth. I could easily say that the level of character-group customization could be extremely daunting to someone who is new to the genre. As far as combat is related, I've heard self-proclaimed "PC and RPG expert gamers" alike commenting on how difficult Origins is on the normal difficulty even. I don't like to toot my own horn but I played it on nightmare (after level 5) and at times I thought it felt like it was on easy. So, as far as learning curve is concerned I'd have to say it is situational to how much time you've spent with this type of game. It is definitely not a "jump right in" for anyone who hasn't spent time on games with heavy stat, gear, and skill tree progression and that is not even from a gameplay-combat perspective. Though I had absolutely no trouble with the game's difficulty I have heard people that are supposed "good RPGers" having a rough time. So, all I can say to that is...I guess it's a good thing you can change the game's difficulty at any time whenever you wish during your Origins campaign.The VALUE of Dragon Age: Origins is simply fantastic. The first time I beat the game I tried to do absolutely everything I could find and I clocked in around 90 hours of gameplay time. My first play-through on the Xbox 360 (with the 3 DLCs that take place during Origins) I clocked in 102:14:12. Yes...102 hours. You could probably get through the game in about 40 if you just sped through it and barely listened to dialogue and did basically no side-quest, but you'd be doing yourself a major disservice if you played the game like that. The value is high because the number of hours spent playing is a welcome addition and you actually want to put the time in. Also, with the number of different nuances through narrative and character-team customization this game has some serious replay value.Also, as a small note, I play the game on nightmare. So, when you are gauging how long it takes me to complete something you have to consider it takes a bit longer to finish battles do to more time pausing and micromanagement and larger health pools on enemies. You might not think that would add a lot of time onto a game, but add a few more minutes per battle...a few hundred times and it tacks on some hours. In addition, I am also a slow reader and I fiddle in the skill trees and ponder for lengthy periods of time about character builds too. Also, i read the codexes entries quite often. Just something to take into consideration regarding how long I say something takes.===============ALL IN ALL: ORIGINS=============All in all, Dragon Age: Origins is a meticulously and masterfully crafted deep, deep RPG experience in which you can pause time and micromanage your party of four. And that experience is best on the PC, but the minor technical and mechanical issues of the console versions can't stop this game from blasting-off into the stratosphere no matter what platform you plan to play it on.That being said, Dragon Age: Origins' combat mechanics feel most at home when compared to the functionality of most conventional MMORPGs with cool-down timers, auto-attacking, potion chugging, and the group makeup that seem to be consistent in games like those, but set on a single-player format. A non-too original main storyline takes a backseat to the real star of the show which is the world in which all of the game's events take place and the characters that inhabit them in a brilliantly come-to-life dark medieval fantasy universe. You could easily get lost in this world with a flexible game time of 40-90 hours depending on how much time you'd like to spend in Ferelden. A great fantasy universe coupled with a multitude of different character-team builds you can create and think of with the game's wide range of skills, armor, weapons, secondary specializations, and group composition can keep you wanting to come back time and again. So, if you're a RPG fan then it is definitely time to buckle-on a shield and unsheathe a sword, possibly face a few dragons along the way, and unquestionably meet some unique and wonderful characters in this engrossing and immersive dark fantasy world because Dragon Age: Origins should not be missed by any fan of the genre.2. DOWN LOADABLE/ADD-ON CONTENTCOINSIDE WITH THE ORIGNS COMPAIGN.These DLCs will all be opened in the Origins game's world map after the completion of the Battle of Ostagar or leaving Loathering (a town right after Ostagar). These add-ons are labeled via yellow map markers or given by a NPC in your camp site.Feastday Gifts/Pranks - These items are sold by the merchant in your camp site. The gifts or pranks give a way to "play around with" your party member's love/hate of you. There are generic gifts that give a fixated number of love or hate and they're cheap to buy. There is also a specific gift for love or hate that costs nothing and will give you -/+50 to your relationship with every character obtainable. The "love" gifts can also have functionality during combat. For example, Sten's gift allows him to read from a Qunari book for the dead which revives all fallen party members during combat, Zevran gets some brandy that gives him a +2 Dexterity buff, or it can range to things that have no functionality besides from small blips of entertainment like Leliana playing some guitar or Alistair playing with a puppet. All in all, this add-on can sound seemingly useless but it really is useful. With the ability to be able to easy influence your party member's love for you it allows you to take desired avenues of dialogue and actions taken throughout the game without having to worry about the repercussions of who you're going to piss off with said decisions or actions. Of course, the game will still be extremely impacted by the choices you've made...but at least you're favorite party member wouldn't leave due to a faulty ethics choice of yours. The Feastday add-on is really an "okay I've beaten the game now I want to mess around during my next playthroughs" addition. I'd say try not to use it at all your first time into the game.Warden's Keep - Very short, possibly spanning...Continue and finish the review in its entirety with the address below.[...]
Quickly I always rate games on three categories. Gameplay (how it plays, graphics), Story, and Characters (Character development and how I enjoy the characters). Story usually is weighted the mostDragon Age 2 is a great game. I will start off by saying that I loved DA:O and, while this game doesn't quite stack up against it, it's still a great game IMO.Gameplay: 8/10Amazing really. Some small sacrifices like limited customization of your party, missing specializations (I'm looking at you Champion and Arcane Warrior) and recycled dungeons kind of hurt it but added things like battle animations, cross class combos, and non linear progression in your abilities all made up for it. A lot of people are complaining about the recycled dungeons but honestly it really doesn't bother me that much because every time I walk into the same old dungeon, new battles and events are waiting on me. I did think that blocking off parts of dungeons/houses was kind of lame but really just a small negative in the grand scheme of things.The limited customization of your party members is a big sticking point with people as well. I like the fact that my party members have their own clothes and look completely different. I hated the fact in DA:O that all my warriors looked the same, my rogues looked the same, and all my mages (except for Morrigan) looked the same. This is a good way of solving that problem. I am saddened that they took out my favorite two specializations (champion and arcane warrior) but they gave me enough in the other specializations to make the hit less noticeable. The graphics were a big uptick from Origins as well. For every negative in the gameplay there is at least 2 positives.Story 8.5/10Pretty good. You can't help but compare this to Origins though. The story doesn't come anywhere close to Origins however it still does a good job. The story seemed a little frantic and was taken over by the IMMENSE number of sidequests. I like sidequests and I definitely saw the purpose of them in this game but it did detract from the main story. The change in tempo is refreshing for me. I mean who wants a world that has a potentially world ending problem every 5 years. Thedas would be awful. We just had a blight 7 years ago...let's not throw the world into chaos again this quickly. But it is obvious that the story overall just doesn't stack up against Origins. Not many stories can stack up to a corrupted god leading an army of ravenous flesh eating mutants against the world.Characters 9/10About on par with DA:O to me. The characters had about the same spread of awesome characters and forgettable characters. For awesome characters DA:O had Morrigan, Shale, and Alistair. DA2 had Varic, Isabella, and Anders. For forgettable characters, DA:O had Oghren and Zevran where DA2 had Aveline and Sebastian. And the rest fell somewhere in the middle (DA:O you had Leliana, Sten, and Wynn that were neither awesome but they were still good characters, and DA2 had Merrill and Fenris that were actually pretty good). I'm not counting in the siblings because I have only done one play through and that was with Bethany. And since ***Spoiler***you lose your sibling for the majority of the game ****End Spoiler**** and the fact that my playthrough I had Bethany, I can't really count them.The one area that DA2 had better in the character department was easily the character quests. Fenris, Isabella, Merrill, and Varric's sidequests were amazing. DA:O character quests had maybe one amazing one? That would be morrigan's. The others were good but not as good as DA2. Also, the fact that Hawke was voiced in this one surprisingly made me enjoy the game more than I thought it would.  This was a major sticking point before the game came out but I haven't really heard many people complain about it now that the game is out. That probably means Bioware did this part well.Overall 8.5/10Really this game is a good follup to DA:O. It definitely has it's weak points in forgettable characters and lame gameplay elements (repeated environments, the vast number of sidequests that were virtually little more than fetch quests, and limited party customization) but overall it served it's purpose by giving a quality story to expand the world of thedas.  With the absolute awesomeness that was DA:O it's hard for something to follow up to be anywhere as good. But DA2 does it's best and does well.
Dragon Age: Origins was a decent game, but most of the good content are DLC and must be paid for to get the full enjoyment for the game. At the beginning, the player customizes their character to play with, with their race, class, origin (background story), along with how they look like. After they accomplish their origin story, evenually all 6 of the origins (City Elf, Dalish Elf, Human Noble, Dwarf Commoner, Dwarf Noble, and Magi) will come to Ostagar and becomes a Grey Warden. Soon the city is attacked and destroyed, the only survivors are the player and a junior Grey Warden named Alistair. The player is able to recruit characters from throughout Fereldon, the kingdom in which the story takes place. The player's decisions and dialogue, as well as gifts, will influence the party members' approval, which is how much they like or hate you. Having a high approval for characters will give a boost on their stats and for certain characters, a chance for romance. On the other hand, if the approval rating is extremely low, the character may leave or betray you. The recruitable characters in origins are Alistair (human warrior/templar), Morrigan (human mage/shapechanger, Leliana (human rogue/bard), Oghren (dwarf warrior/berserker), Zevran (elf rogue/assassin), Wynne (human mage/spirit healer), and Dog (Mabari Dog warrior). Later in the storyline, at the landsmeet, the player can recruit Loghain Mac Tir (human warrior/champion), but then will risk Alistair leaving the party permanently. The player is supposed to use treaties to recruit armies from different areas of Fereldon to fight the Blight, a army of Darkspawn (tainted enemies) that are led by an archdemon taking the form of a dragon.
This is a world of tyrants and corruption. This is a world of many different races, and many poor opinions to those races. This is a world of magic and demons. This is the world of the Darkspawn and the Blight. This is the world of Dragon Age.This is Dragon Age II, sequel to the immensely popular Dragon Age Origins of 2009. Developed by BioWare of the popular Mass Effect series and the upcoming Star Wars: The Old Republic, this game aims to follow up a game whose world immersed many players who could not get enough of the politically charged world of the Origins. However there have been many differences made in the 18 month development cycle that are getting many of the hardcore fans upset. Thankfully, while many things have changed, most of them are changes for the better, and they all add up an RPG that is different from the original, yet superb on its own.STORY 9.25The story of Dragon Age II follows a male or female named Hawke, a Fereldan citizen fleeing from the Blight. Because this game takes place mostly right after the events of the first game, the Blight has been defeated throughout most of the game, and therefore Darkspawn are not your primary enemies. You do still fight Darkspawn occasionally, however they are far and few between, and because of such you are mostly fighting demons and human guards, mercenaries, etc.The story of the first Dragon Age was based almost entirely on the world it took place in, not as much as your character you played as. The sequel negates this idea by making it take place almost entirely in one city, which is the city of Kirkwall, which makes it much more personal because you are more familiar with your environment and are not constantly moving around to different cities where things are constantly changing. I personally think that this is a great thing to do because it definitely feels like YOUR city, however I can see how some people may not like it because it definitely feels limiting, and it also makes the game lack a sense of diversity in the environments. Another thing that makes this story much more personal is the inclusion of family, which does in fact play a huge role in the story. The beginning of the story deals with Hawke trying to get his family safe, and throughout the game, you will become a champion of Kirkwall, plus your family grows and changes just as the character of Hawke does, and their actions depend very much on what you do throughout.The story brings in many decisions that will invoke emotion, and some decisions will make you truly stop and think about the consequences that may occur. The thing that makes it even more incredible is that even from your very early decisions, you will feel like your decisions have a very significant impact on the world. There will be times where something bad might have happened, and you could have done something earlier to stop it from happening, and it makes you actually think about it. It is very well done, especially since the overall story of the game lacks direction. It truly feels like your story; a story that you the player craft. My personal story felt almost like a romance at parts because of a path I decided to take with a certain companion, and it amazed me at how the story shifted to allow that. It is even more amazing because I know somebody who played through the game without that companion at all, and in mine, that companion was almost integral to the story.The story spans 10 years and is separated into three acts, each of which ends in a major event that will affect the city in a big way. The problem is, however, that there isn't really an overarching story that ties the three acts together. The only thing that really ties them together is the rank in the city that Hawke grows as time progresses, and there are times where you might feel like you don't remember why you are doing some of the things you are doing. It may get irritating at times, but it never affected me so much that I wanted to stop playing. Part of what helps that is the number and quality of awesome side quests.There are four types of quests in the game. There is Main Plot quests, Secondary Quests, Companion Quests, and Side Quests. Main plot quests are the line of quests that will make you proceed through the story throughout the three acts. These quests usually bring an important plot point into your mind, however there are times where you may not be exactly sure how it affects the story. Rest assured, you will find out eventually, and when you do, you will be happy you did so. Next up is Secondary Quests, which is an interesting animal. Many of the Secondary Quests are simply "go there, do this, come back" quests, however every once in a while, there is a Secondary Quest that has a plot that is very intriguing, and you will want to see them through until the end. Next up are Companion Quests, which are certainly the best side quests in the game, assuming that you interact with your companions. Each companion you have has their own unique back-story, and the many of the Companion Quests that you do involve that specific companion's back-story. Doing these quests not only gives you an interesting plot, each of which you will want to see through until the end, but they also further your relationship with that character, romantic or not. Last and certainly least are Side Quests, which essentially are quests in which there are things that you can find along the way, and if you find all of them, you can go back and claim a reward. It is definitely the weakest of the quests, so much so that I didn't complete a single Side Quest.Speaking of companions, lets talk about the romances with companions. You will encounter a multitude of companions, each of which you have an opportunity to engage romantically with. Much to the game's credit, unlike the first game, some of the companions that you have the opportunity to have sex with in the game are characters that you would actually WANT to have sex with, regardless of the player's sexuality. I don't know how BioWare did it, but they managed to make each of these characters very interesting and compelling, and they also make you think before you act because there can be times where if you do something wrong, the companion can leave, sometimes for good. One thing about the characters that I did not like, however, is that throughout the game, there will be a number of characters that you can choose to either save or let die. Being a "good" character (which I will get to later), I saved all that I came across. The problem, however, is that near the end of the game, there are parts where many of the characters you interacted with and saved come back, and you are almost expected to remember all of them and what you did for them. This is very frustrating to me because I didn't remember many of them, especially since there are characters in the game that look very similar, almost to the point that you cannot differentiate two different characters.Overall, I thought the story was excellent. The characters in it are incredible, especially the ones that return from the first game (Enchantments anyone?). It may be very different than that of the first, but in a way, it had to be, because if it was just another "the end of the world is coming" story, players might have felt D&eacute;j&agrave; vu and may not have seen it all the way through. With this, however, I wanted to see how the game would end, which is a huge credit to the game. Another credit to the game is that it stops you from playing either a completely good or a completely bad character as many RPGs nowadays allow you to do, even more so than the original Dragon Age. You may think you are doing a good thing, but it can easily turn into something bad, and there are consequences to everything. This is a great thing to see, as many times in games you choose the good dialog option because you want to be the good guy or vice versa for evil, but this game can preclude you from doing that very easily.GAMEPLAY 9.25Much has been made about the gameplay in Dragon Age II. People have been saying that it was dumbed down for consoles. People have also been saying that it is now too easy. As a PC gamer who didn't mind the Dragon Age Origins combat but also didn't think it was anything exceptional I personally I think that the revamp for gameplay is a large leap forward. It looks much more fluid, it is not nearly as clunky as the first, and each time an enemy explodes in blood by your hand, it is immensely satisfying.If you are new to Dragon Age, the whole idea of the combat in Dragon Age is the traditional Baulder's Gate tradition of party combat and pausing the game and micro-managing each party member. The sequel is no different, except that they simplified many things that needed simplifying. The new spells and special abilities you gain each level has been simplified to multiple families of spells, each of which the player can choose to specialize in. Each family has more or less than five spells, each of which can also be upgraded. Through the course of the game, you will level up enough to completely fill up about two of those families of your choice, which makes you actually feel like you are doing things you truly want to do. Also returning are the six attributes that you can put points in as you level. It works exactly like it did in the first game, however the sequel does a much better job at showing you what you will benefit in when you put a point in a certain attribute.For all of you hardcore players out there, don't you worry: the difficulty in this game is perfectly fine. They made they curve for the Normal difficulty easier so more people can play on Normal (which is what I played on), however even on Normal there were many parts where I died and had to retry. The Hardcore and Nightmare difficulties have also returned for all of you crazy players who can handle that, a feat I personally have no intentions of completing. It is, however, there for anyone who wishes to do it.There is one thing that I very much disliked about Dragon Age II's combat, and that is the removal of the top-down view. BioWare's excuse for this was that they couldn't put roofs on the buildings, and therefore it took out many of their design ideas. I for one believe, however, that this is no excuse. There are many times where there are a multitude of enemies in which I needed a much greater view on what is happening, something that I couldn't do. Also, as a mage, there were times where I needed to cast Area of Effect spells on a certain area. However, because you cannot see as well, when you are casting spells on a sloped area, your vision is blinded in such a way that you cannot tell if you are hitting what you want to hit. It can be very frustrating at times, however did not at all diminish my enjoyment of the game in any significant way.SOUND 9.75The sound in this game, like Dragon Age Origins and just about every other BioWare game, is spectacular. The score does a very impressive job at conveying the mood, and it fits just right in those epic scenes that either makes you feel like a true badass, or makes you feel vulnerable as it makes you feel emotion when it wants you to. The voice acting in the game is also spectacular. There is the occasional voice that is not good (for lack of a better term), but the majority of the characters are voiced incredibly. Each character has a voice that truly sells you on the character, especially the main character Hawke, who is now fully voiced unlike in the first game. This has also caused a fair bit of controversy with the hardcore community, as many of them felt that the lack of voice in the main character allowed the player to fill in that voice with whatever they want, like one would do in Link or Metroid. I, however, thought that it was completely out of place, especially with the full voice support of all of BioWare's other games, and am glad that they saw that and voiced him or her.Part of what makes the voice acting so spectacular is the sheer number of possible dialog options in the game. Each dialog option leads to its own response, and all of these have great voice acting. Much has also been made of the dialog system in this game, as it is definitely more like Mass Effect in that you have usually three options: one is good, one is humorous, and one is bad. In this, however, each dialog option has an icon next to it so that you will know what the tone of your character will be. In short, you will know if you are flirting or not. Another "Mass Effect" feature is the addition of a summarized text option. Each dialog option is basically a summarization of what Hawke is trying to say. There were some times in which I felt differently than how I wanted to be, however much of the time the thing Hawke actually said is actually how I was feeling. I feel like this is much improved to the purely text-based dialog system of Dragon Age Origins, which was definitely impressive, but it just didn't fit for the kind of game BioWare was aiming on making in Dragon Age II.GRAPHICS 8.5The graphics in the game are great, speaking for the PC, especially with the High-Res textures. It's no Crysis 2, but it's not trying to be. The art style seems much different, as it is trying much less to be realistic as the first one was. Instead, it seems almost cartoony, so much so that the some of the character designs reminded me of the Sims, except that I can actually understand what the people in Dragon Age II are saying.Something that everyone can understand is the amount of blood in this game, yet they may not be able to believe how much is in this game. If Dragon Age Origins was a 9 on a scale of 1-10 of blood, Dragon Age II is a 14. It gets brutal. Every time you kill an enemy, no matter if you are using a sword or magic, the NPC explodes into blood and the body parts fall apart onto the floor. It makes the combat much more satisfying when you hit somebody and they explode. Something that also makes its glorious return is the inclusion of blood on characters during dialog scenes. You can turn it off it you want, but I always get a kick out of having a totally serious conversation while covered in blood.The one disappointment I had with the graphics, and its not necessarily the graphics themselves so much as the map that BioWare created for this game, was the reuse of assets. BioWare is known for reusing assets, but Dragon Age II brings that to a whole new level. The most noticeable of this is the reuse of the same four or five dungeons in the game. There are about five different maps that you go through as dungeons, but they are repeated over and over again, with no differences at all in architecture. The only differences are that sometimes certain doors are closed. All of this would be somewhat bearable if BioWare bothered to get rid of the map of the area you can't even go to in that specific dungeon. There will be a door there that you are unable to open, but if you look on the map, the road is still there, which many times made me think that was the way I was supposed to go. It was very frustrating at times, and it definitely made the game feel rushed, which is so surprising given how fooled one could be when thinking about how much time was actually spent developing this game.REPLAYABILITY 9.0The length of Dragon Age II has been an interesting thing to talk about. I have talked to a couple of people who said that the game took the 40 hours or so to complete. Others I have talked to say that it took them 15-20 hours. I personally did almost every side quest, save for a couple that I deliberately skipped, and I listened to all of the conversations, and it took me just over 20 hours to complete. This is a shocker, as in the first Dragon Age; side quests alone could easily fill up 50 hours. The difference in this game, however, is that I feel like there are so many different ways that one can go through those 20 hours I played that it is definitely worth replaying at least once, if not twice or three times. The thing about the Dragon Age series that is awesome as well is that you can also go through the first game again and import a different world each time. I personally didn't import a save from the Origins because of a hard drive error, but I can definitely see myself going through Origins again and importing the save into Dragon Age II and completely changing my play style to see all the different possibilities.OVERALL 8.75For what its worth and remembering how long it took them to make it, Dragon Age II is an incredible achievement. They managed to create an engaging story in less than half the time it took BioWare to make the first Dragon Age, not even counting the fact that they had to make DLC for the first one as well. As for the game itself, had it not been connected to the Dragon Age name and the BioWare name, it would easily be an incredible game. The conversations are staggering, the combat is amazingly fun, and the story and side quests are very entertaining. However, because it is a BioWare developed Dragon Age game, it has to be put up to the same standards as the first one, in terms of quality and also mechanics. I feel like too many of the mechanics were changed to be called a true Dragon Age game. It is a game in which all of its separate parts are great, but there is something that holds the collective hole back from greatness if you have played the original Dragon Age. Having said that, if you can look past the Dragon Age name, you will find a great RPG that will engross you and leave you begging for more.
Bioware's 'Dragon Age: Origins' was one of my favorite games of 2009. It had a good story to tell with memorable characters and was overall a fun throwaway to the RPG days of Baldur's Gate and KOTOR. 'Dragon Age: Origins' also had bland graphics and sluggish combat controls that made it appealing only to a specific crowd. Now 'Dragon Age 2' is out and while it doesn't quite rank up there with their best titles (and borrows heavily from their other game 'Mass Effect'), it's a much more accessible experience and a solid addition to Bioware's RPG lineup!The story of 'Dragon Age 2' unfolds like a good novel: Varric, a dwarf is being interrogated by the Chantry in order to discover the location of Hawke, the "Champion of Kirkwall". You then choose Hawke's character class and (after a brief tutorial) character appearance, then play through the events that led up to the Chantry seeking Hawke and the reasons why. This "framed-narrative" structure (think 'Rashomon' or 'The Social Network') gives the plot a unique feel that is echoed throughout the game with strong characters and morally ambiguous situations. Unfortunately the overall story, involving tensions between the Mages and Templars of Kirkwall really isn't that compelling with only a few subplots that stick out (the conflicts with the Qunari and the confrontation with a certain serial-killer were the most memorable). The writing and dialogue is still very strong but we never get the sense of closure we got in 'Dragon Age Origins' or a villain as memorable as Logain (though I think Varric may be my favorite Bioware hero to date!).The visuals in 'Dragon Age 2' are a huge improvement over 'Dragon Age: Origins' as far as it's design and detail. Everything has an angular, gothic-look like it was taken from a Michael Moorcock novel and the feeling of this damaged world is reflected in characters' appearances as well as buildings and structures. The fighting animations and spells are very flashy during combat and much more varied than DA:O. I would've liked to see more variety in locations (and weather effects) as the entire game takes place in or around Kirkwall. The constant reusing of dungeons in side-quests gets really annoying after a while and is very lazy for a modern game.The sound in 'Dragon Age 2' is easily Bioware's best accomplishment! All of the characters are voice-acted to perfection (with Hawke's voice adapting to your dialogue choices as the game goes) but it's the music that really impresses. Each area of Kirkwall seems to have it's own theme (day and night) and really brings out the more downbeat tone of the game.The gameplay has changed a bit from 'Dragon Age: Origins' but not to the extent you might think. Hawke can only be a human (I miss playing an elf) and his/her background only changes somewhat depending on your character class. You use a dialogue wheel in conversations which decides Hawke's personality and can lead to some extra actions and relationships (which are MUCH easier to navigate) depending on your party members. You still collect loot off enemies and micromanage your party's weapons and items, though you can only change Hawke's armor. The combat controls are MUCH more involved and satisfying than DA:O(especially on the PS3 controller) as you have to keep pushing buttons to move around and attack. Other than that you can still pause during combat and setup tactics for your party.The one BIG difference from 'Dragon Age: Origins' to 'Dragon Age 2' is the fighting-classes: each character-class is COMPLETELY unique. Fighters are powerhouses that can engage more than one enemy at a time. Rogue's are freaking ninjas that zip around taking down enemies with arrows and daggers. Mages are effective in close-combat but can still be used to heal party members and unleash some awesome spells. The one draw-back is that each class can only use it's own specific weapons (rogue's can't use swords, fighters can't use two weapons or bows) and the skill tree encourages you to stay with one weapon set. Some skills DO change the way you fight and some of your fighting animations but for the most part you'll be using the same tactics over and over again.As a sequel 'Dragon Age 2' is a letdown with it's lack of customization, repetitive/reused environments and underwhelming story. Taken as it's own game however, with it's strong writing and satisfying combat 'Dragon Age 2' is one of the better RPG's I've played this year. Recommended!

Pros:+Delightful art style and sense of humor+Easy to pick up and play+Tons of levels+Lots of customization+Tons of variety+Good music+Fun multiplayer experiences+Level creation and the ability to share onlineCons:-It doesn't really do a whole lot of things the first game didn't already perfect.  On the other hand, it's hard to say if this is such a bad thing because there's still a lot of variety and it doesn't repeat any puzzles from the first game, but some might still wish they'd added a bit more to itThe original Boom Blox was quite an amazing game.  It just sort of dropped in there from EA and Steven Spielberg.  Yet to the enjoyment of many gamers it was a great game that was simple to pick up, addictive and huge.  There was so much to do within the game that no one could imagine putting it down for a while.  Boom Blox Bash Party is pretty much the same game.  It doesn't add a whole lot, but then again, it doesn't really have to.  You're more or less getting an expansion of the first game.  There are new puzzles and new challenges.  It'll feel fresh if it's the first time you've played Boom Blox, but for those who played the first one, they need to know that they're getting an expansion and not really getting a lot of new things.Much like the first game, it's easy to pick up and play.  There are still a ton of modes to enjoy here, and a ton of levels to do.  Boom Blox Bash Party will keep you busy for a few days.  You'll also be surprised to find that it can, and often is, quite challenging.  Trying to figure out how to do specific puzzles is actually a treat and can test your abilities.  So much so that once you complete a level, you'll probably go back to see if you can do a better job.  There are medals to get in every level.  You have to get a bronze at the least to move on, but die-hard players will end up playing levels over and over again for the gold.  It's very fun and very addictive.  If you find yourself getting frustrated with one level, you'll be glad to know that there are so many levels that you'll be able to find something to do easily.There are many of the same tools that come into the fray in Boom Blox Bash Party.  The balls that you'll throw at blocks return (and the bombs) and so do many of the other tools like the grab tool and whatnot.  Likewise, many of the puzzles have the same objectives as the first game.  You might find yourself playing a game where you have to pull blocks out, hoping not to knock over the penalty block (in Jenga like fashion), or you may find yourself having to demolish whole areas using bombs.  With the addition of Zero Gravity levels and underwater levels, there's a bit of variety.  But as I mentioned earlier, you won't find any of this new if you already played the first game.  For newcomers, however, they'll find this to be quite a treat.All of this stuff is done with the Wii Remote.  You'll either point, lock on and give a flick of the wrist to throw balls, or you'll have to click and maneuver the Wii Remote to pull out blocks.  It's all simple stuff and makes excellent use of the Wii Remote controls.  And as I mentioned, it's so easy to pick up on that no one should have any trouble jumping in at all.  Boom Blox is accessible to everyone.There's a level creator that people can use to build their own levels as well.  It can feel kind of limiting, but you'll be surprised at what you can come up with.  You can also share these levels online and download some creations by other players.Then there's multiplayer where you and a few friends can do some of the objectives against each other.  Or you can go on a co-op campaign.  These are just as fun.  Playing against friends is much more fun than playing with them.  You'll all have a blast.The original Boom Blox had an interesting artistic style and Bash Party continues it.  It might not be the best Wii Game out there, but it's the artistic design that keeps Boom Blox strong in the visuals department.  The theme is unchanged and it's kind of fun to see those block characters and the levels.  It's very colorful, very smooth and the frame rate is always consistent.  The physics are also very really good.Sure enough, the game still sounds great.  There are some great tunes and sound effects from the block characters.  You just might find yourself enjoying some of the tunes and humming them.  It's also nice to see that there is still a sense of humor there as well.The only real big issue with this game is that for those who played and enjoyed the original, you're getting what can virtually be seen as the same game.  Which makes that price tag a bit steep when you realize you're basically getting an expansion of what's already been done.  It's still an enjoyable game for fans and newcomers alike (though newcomers will like it much more, I'm sure).  It's just doesn't do much more than what the original did.  However, that's not really such a bad thing.  Since it is as simple as the first game and doesn't try so hard to outdo it, it still stands tall.  Some who played the first one might even come to enjoy Bash Party much more.  It doesn't add a lot but it varies up the experience enough to be a different game all together.The original Boom Blox was a treat.  A real addictive and fun game.  Bash Party is just as good, just as addictive and just as enjoyable.  If you have the first game, give this one a try.  If you never played Boom Blox before, then this is a great place to introduce yourself.
Steven Spielberg is mostly known for the movies he's created.  This wouldn't be the first time that Spielberg has lended a hand to the gaming culture.  Most gamers know him as the creator of the Medal of Honor series.  Boom Blox is in a whole different crowd from Medal of Honor, but it's a lot of fun.Boom Blox is quite different from your standard puzzle game.  There are several different game modes.  Not only that, but this isn't a game that will keep you busy for merely hours.  It can easily keep you busy for days.  It takes more work than you can possibly imagine to unlock everything the game has to offer.  Not only that, but it's impossible to do it alone, as the multiplayer is entirely different from the single player experience.There are a few different things you'll be doing in Boom Blox.  In one set of mini-games for example, your goal is to destroy all the gem blocks, which will require you to throw a ball or a bomb or something else.  The unique thing about Boom Blox, is that the physics are amazing.  The harder you throw the ball, the greater its reflected in the game itself.  It's not uncommon to get so into it that your arms might hurt from time to time.  And yes, where you throw it, how hard, and the trajectory are all important aspects.  The mini games where you throw are some of the best in the entire game.Other mini games give you a grabbing tool where you'll pull blocks in a Jenga like fashion and keep baby cows from falling or keep a penalty block from touching the ground.  These are incredible mini-games which really put your mind to the test.  It plays exactly like Jenga, and the same rules apply here.The last type of mini game is more or less a shooting range.  Of all the mini-games in Boom Blox, these are some of the worst.  They're neither as fun or as thought provoking.  However, if you just want to go wild for a little bit, these games aren't bad.  Still, they feel a little out of place considering what the other two force you to do.All these mini games can be played seperately in their own section, or you can mix them all together in the adventure mode which puts a lot of objectives ahead of you.  And once again, it's a lot of fun.  However, there are plenty of other things to keep in mind.  It's more than just throwing balls, pulling blocks and shooting.  There are many different kinds of blocks that play a part in each and every one of Boom Blox's complex puzzles.  There are vanishing blocks, which vanish whenever you hit them, chemical blocks that upon making contact with another chemical block, explode.  There are also bomb blocks where if you hit them, they explode instantly.Each time you complete a puzzle or advance to the next game, you'll be awarded a Bronze, Silver or Gold Medal.  The conditions for getting a gold can sometimes be steep, but once you see what it takes you'll find it was actually... quite obvious.  You can't go on to the next puzzle unless you qualify.Boom Blox is obviously made for multiplayer.  As I mentioned earlier, the multiplayer is totally different from the single player.  You can cooperate with one or more friends or you can go against them.  The mini games against a friend can be fun.  Such as one that allows you both to assault each other with a barrage of throws to take down the other's fort.  Most of them are played out with the two of you taking turns, but it's also very balanced because Boom Blox is so easy to come to.  A veteran gamer will not have an advantage over a newcomer.  Yet, it's also nice because nothing here is based on luck.Cooperative is similar to the single player experience, with the difference being in some games you'll take turns and in others you'll be working together at the same time.  You'll find yourself talking it out just to figure out how to go through it, yet it's a lot more fun than you'd expect.If there was any downside to Boom Blox, it would be that the multiplayer is far far more rewarding than the single player experience.  Once you get into the multiplayer, the single player campaign seems downright boring in comparison.  Boom Blox is a game that is meant to be played with friends and it succeeds there very well.  That doesn't mean the single player experience doesn't succeed.  It simply means that the multiplayer experience is just that much better.The other big problem with Boom Blox is that once you trump through it all... you don't want to do it again.  Aside from competing against friends, Boom Blox doesn't have much replay, as a lot of puzzle games of its like don't.  However, there's so much to keep you busy that you'll still get your moneys worth.  While there's not much replay, there is, however, the ability to create your own levels and puzzles and even share them with other players.  So even after you complete it all, you can still check out what others have created, and I don't know about you, but I think that's better than simple replay value.Graphics wise Boom Blox isn't appealing as far as visuals are concerned.  It looks pretty basic.  There's not a whole lot in the graphics that really stand out.  Everything is, of course, blocky (not in a bad way).  What stands out in the game's graphics however are its astonishing physics.  Boom Blox not only demonstrates how to use the Wii Remote to its full effectiveness, but it also demonstrates how to make a game real.  So while it isn't big on visual appeal, it has a certain charm to its graphics that you won't find in most games.  Music wise the game is incredible.  The music is really good and catchy, but the sound effects are probably some of the best parts of its design.Boom Blox is a rare Wii game.  It's one that's fun and accessible to everyone.  Best of all, it uses the Wii Remote controls better than most games before it.  If you're looking for a game that's fun, accessible and will keep you busy for a very long time, then Boom Blox is it.  It's by far one of the best games you can buy for the Wii right now.
I just finished playing this game and while I enjoyed it overall, I can give you some pretty good insight into the good and the bad of it:1. The graphics are nice but a little too cartoonish for my personal tastes2. The music is good, sets the mood very nicely in a given area or for a scene3. Creatures jumping out creates a startle and a sense that anything can happen.  Even near the end it still can give you a bit of a jump.4. The creatures interact with each other as well sometimes.  Its nice to see various "enemies" fighting themselves instead of the standard condition in which all enemies are united against you.  Its fun to creep up on a couple enemies going at it and just sit and watch them and then you only have to fight the winner of that battle rather than taking on everyone at once.  Sweet!5. There's a lot of dialogue to go through with each character you meet and frankly a lot of its repetative.  I felt obligated to go through every subject with every character, but still, it got tedious and took more time than I would have liked.  I suppose this is part of the RP segment of the game in which if all you want is hack and slash you can skip reading or listening to whatever anyone has to say.  About halfway through I gave up trying to read through all that dialogue and only stuck to what I needed to know to do a quest which frankly, you don't even need to read that either.6. There's a lot of RP info out there in books and other items you pick up and can browse through.  It doesn't have any impact on the game of course, but if you like the idea of immersing yourself in a world and learning about it then that option is there.  This is rather nicely done.  The game already takes so long if you try to do everything that I bet it would take twice as long (like 200+ hours) if you really looked at and read everything.7. I like the creatures.  They all seem fairly unique to each other and the graphics of them are decent enough.  Again a bit cartoonish at times but still enjoyable.8. It's a really big world that's fairly open.  There's a feeling that you can just go explore or whatever and different text colors of the creature names tell you how challenging it will be compared to what your development is.  I being a more organized type, went through each area before moving on to the next, taking on as many quests as I saw (but I imagine you can just shoot through doing the main quest as well).9. The voice work is okay but not particularly great.  At times it seems like ridiculous over the top emoting in the voice acting, and some of the accents are unconvincing and silly and they all seem to have these Scottish or Irish accents (not sure which because I'm not great at telling which is which).10.  It can get a little boring and monotonous.  I found myself kind of dreading seeing another person who needed help, yet another side quest that resembled most of the others.  Go get this, go do that.  I took them all, I suppose that's the point of the game but they just got really boring after a while and frankly, I was so knee deep on side and faction quests that I often forgot what the main goal of the game even was.11. Feels like there's just way too much to try and do.  Besides the many quests, most of which get boring after a while, the idea of sage-crafting, alchemy, blacksmith is all nice but to try and learn and experiment with it and figure out all of it on top of the rest of the game just seemed like a bit much to me.  I made a few good weapons and armor, but I never really got the parts to make stuff that was so completely advanced compared to what I was finding or could buy that I can say it was worthwhile, it really wasn't.  I guess to that end,  you don't really need to do any of that.  There's plenty of potions to find or buy, lots of great armor and weapons around and same with gems. That having been said, gems could be a good source of revenue, except you don't really need it.  I just sold most of what I found and still ended up with millions in gold at the end, not that it really does me any good at the end I suppose.12. There's really no point to exploration.  The quests tell you exactly where to go and mark your map and everything, so there's no figuring anything out.  You don't even need to bother reading the dialogue from the characters in which they tell you where to go.  Why bother?  Just look at the map.  Without the map telling you exactly what to do, the dialogue no doubt would be far more valuable to pay attention to and I think the map probably does too much.  If it were me, I would have had an option to toggle show quests on the map for people who maybe don't want it spoon-fed quite as much.13. There's also a bunch of tasks which are filed under quests, but unlike quests, most of the tasks can't actually be completed.  This isn't a glitch or anything, its that they're repeatable, meaning you can just keep doing the tasks over and over so they never really go into the completed file.  As a potentially OCD person who likes to complete things in an organized way, not being able to finish some things like that was a little annoying.  Even if you turn the task down, it still shows up and the guy still has the exclamation mark on his head.After around 70 hours of game-play and 130 quests completed, i just started not to care anymore.  I stopped reading the dialogue and even began to dread seeing more quests coming up.  I reached a point in which I just wanted to be done with it because the quests were getting repetitive and none of it was particularly difficult or challenging.  I tried to turn it up from normal to hard, but all that did was get me more things to fight, not necessarily harder things.  So I was just spending more time fighting stuff that popped up on you as you ran from place to place but it wasn't any more satisfying.After nearly 110 hours and almost 200 completed quests, I finished the game.  The end was a little anti-climactic for me, I thought that the final battle should have been a lot more challenging than it was.  The kind of thing in which you have to use everything you have and really work it to win, but I was thinking that I had battles with countless trolls along the way that took more time than this final battle.I paid $7.49 for a download of the game and at that price it was an incredible value.  Over 100 hours of game-play (more if you actually read everything) can keep you busy for a while.  As I say, it does get really repetitive and a little boring after a while, so how much of the monotonous side and faction quests you really choose to do is up to you.  Still, if you can get a deal on the game, it's worth trying out.
First off, I would like to say that Sim City 4 Deluxe Edition works on Windows 7 64 bit. I kept on reading reviews that either said it didn't or didn't mention Windows 7. So, I took the risk and tried it and have no issues. I bought it as a download from Amazon and I have Windows 7 64 bit. The game itself isn't bad. I just wanted a simple game for my new computer.So, if you're worried it won't work with Windows 7 64 bit, don't because it will. I didn't even have to use compatibility mode or anything. The main reason I wrote this review was just to state that, because I almost didn't buy the game because I didn't think it was compatible.If you still have doubts, check out Microsofts website website which confirms its compatible:[...]Enjoy!

I don't understand why I keep reading that it doesn't have good graphics; are you people using an HDTV? Do you have an HDMI connection? I wouldn't say it's the best graphics I"ve ever seen but you have to take into consideration that it doesn't load that often and it doesn't take that long when it does. The console systems are working with finite resources and you can't create that big of an environment without 10 minute loading times unless you allow the visuals to suffer a little. People have become so critical of games these days; everyone's an expert all of a sudden. Considering the size of the environments you're playing in, I'd call the graphics top notch.The story is really good and there's a lot of options to change it...I think. I've made choices that have led one direction or another in the story, but I'm not sure if the game would have let me to that path anyways. I know they spent a long time developing this game and the depth is amazing, but after you make a choice in the game, there's no way to know if you actually had a choice or if all the dialogue is just to entertain you and ends in the same result. I'm going to have to compare with other people who used the same race if they had similar results from choices made.I only have a few complaints about this game. I was hoping for an Oblivion style of fighting, but it's closer to turn based. You just hit the A button whenever you feel like it and it attacks an enemy...it's kind of lazy. I prefer the first person hack N slash, but that's just a personal preference. It just feels like there's not too much room for skill to play a role in the combat. Also, why can't I exit out of a conversation? I keep talking to people and realize they have way to much to say...why can't I just hit B if that person's not interesting to me? A lot of the people you interact with don't seem to have much purpose but they sure have a lot to say. I was building up my persuasion skill because I thought that it would help me get cheaper weopons and goods like in Oblivion, but I haven't found it that useful yet...I guess I was able to lie and get a sword from an elf, but usually it just allows you to interact with more people who don't have anything useful to tell you...and you can't hit the B button to stop talking to them, so you just have to get bored and annoyed! They probably should have included an exit strategy for the human interactions. So far the game feels kind of linear too; again, I made choices but I don't know if they were really choices or just resulted in different dialogue but didn't actually change the story line.Anyways, even with all of these little issues, I still have to give it 5 stars because of the depth. You're bound to have little glitches and issues when you create a masterpiece like this. I think that it's unfair to be overly critical of a game with this much content that costs the same as the Shrek game. Think about it.Graphics: 9.0Sound/voice acting: 10Story: 10Combat: 7Replay: 10Controls: 8Overall, I think this is the best RPG released since fallout 3. It's not perfect, but it will certainly keep me busy until COD comes out...and maybe till the next Bethesda gameUpdate:If you hit the X button you can skip conversations; thought I had tried every button, but apparently not. So, this is much better than having to listen to some of the more pointless dialogue.Also, I've been able to use the persuade function to do more relivant things in the last few hours of play, so perhaps it's not as pointless as it seemed initially.And, I definitely had a real choice to make when I was playing last night. It was without a doubt two different outcomes I was choosing from. However, would it have changed the story if I went the other way with my choice? I still don't know how much influence I have on the story when I make these decisions. How linear is the game? I know it's forcing me to recruit all of the different factions that have treaties. So, there's nothing I can do to change this, and I don't know if the little choices I make are going to have any significan impact on the game play. Just have to keep playing I guess.Update 08Nov~Ok, so I made it to the end and I have to say, "WTF!" How can a game be so easy through the whole thing and then impossible at the end? I've tried 4 times and there's no way for me to beat the ArchDemon. I would call the difficult of the game inconsistent at best. So, now that I'm invested in the story, I'll never get to see it finished. I'm not spending another 4 hours trying to level up further just to beat the end.I guess just be really ready when you go to fight the final battle. The reinforcements you worked for 20 hours to round up turn out to be essentially worthless. So, you better have your A game ready to beat this thing.Update 10Nov~Disregard comments about the ending. This is where the glitches finally work in your favor. Just put your party on "hold position" and walk each one to a balista canon on the 4 surounding towers. Then switch between characters and use who's closest to the dragon to shoot it. Sometimes it will just sit there frozen and let you pummel it for five minutes. I didn't even have the Dark Spawn army show up this time. It was actually a little anti climatic to win this way, but at least you can beat it.Traded it in for COD4 MW2 now; having much more fun
I was playing REVENGE OF THE SITH and got a little bored with it. I said to myself, "I need to put down this lightsaber and get me some guns." Even though I bought this a while ago for 50 bucks, it was just sitting around the house because I put so much time in on KILLZONE. I looked at the manual for the controls and popped it in. I wasn't expecting much. Not too many people liked it. Well, I have to say this one is definitely a lot of FUN!! And guns are way better than lightsabers anyway.I've never played GOLDENEYE for N64, so I can't say how it stacks up. I thought EGM magazine said it was the same engine. I don't care, I'm having a blast with this!!The character was a little clunky at first, but I got into the OPTIONS during PAUSE and ramped up the SENSITIVITY for the X and Y axis almost ALL THE WAY. Now the action is fast and I'm moving well. Getting a handle on the controls EARLY is essential. You can only carry one weapon in each hand at any one time and some weapons require 2 hands. 2 handed weapons have a ZOOM feature as well as the SNIPER RIFLE. You also need to pick up weapons that are dropped, very quickly and on the fly. Grenades look weird, but you can throw them far. The animation makes it look like you're throwing a candied yam. Yay. You can only throw grenades with your left hand and only when your left hand is empty. So I learned very quickly to drop my left-handed weapon and throw a grenade, then pick up the weapon again in my left hand in one quick movement. Again, learning the controls early is ESSENTIAL. I've never played an FPS with 2 handed weapons, so it was a nice change to have 2 triggers on the L1 and R1 buttons. Very nice.The difficulty of this game goes up very quickly in a short amount of time and the game is hard going in places. Firefights are intense and cinematic. Keeping a cool head, using defilade, and reloading constantly is a must. The game is designed nicely to give you the proper cover in most situations. Someone here complained about the difficulty. It is hard and I would recommend the EASY setting for newbies. But, if you're an FPS veteran, you'll find that wading through the enemy is at times fast and furious. At other times, bumrushing the enemy will get you killed. The reviewer below said you'll kill at least 100 guys a level. I just completed the VERY LONG Hong Kong level last night and clocked in 262 kills. Wholesale slaughter at a very decent price.You'll also receive BONUS POINTS for imaginative kills and taking enemies hostage for defilade is very cool. Enemy AI can be very smart or very dumb. Just like in real life. Enemy death animations are stylish and real looking. However, the game doesn't feel realistic, but more like a cinematic anime cartoon. Okay by me.Health regenerates when you're hiding and you can pick up the armor from dead enemies if you haven't unloaded a whole clip into them.Most of the weapons are standard fare. Don't forget to use the 357s. They have some punch I was not expecting. But, there are some clever weapons too. Some guy was shooting green darts at me, so I killed him and picked up his VENOM PISTOL in my right hand. I shot the next enemy with it, paralyzed him, then took him out with the uzi in my left hand. Very Bond.One of the coolest features is the GOLDENEYE. With 4 different devices that you earn along the way. After completing 3 very long levels, I acquired 3 of them. One of the EYES sees through walls, stairwells, and objects. Which is very handy at times. Especially when you're looking to see how many enemies are hiding behind that barricade.  And when you're using the RAILGUN which shoots through walls. Other times you won't need it. One of the best is the HACKING EYE, which can be used on the machine environment to kill, disable enemy weapons, or move objects. A welcome feature that makes you feel like a hightech killer. Mastering their use is essential to mastering the game. Learn to use them early.I think the graphics are awesome. They can be a little trippy or weird at times. Not as good as the cell-shaded look of KILLZONE, but very anime none the less. My favorite environs so far where the Bathhouse in Hong Kong, the Snowdome, and the Vegas Casino.The music is incredible and gives that cinematic Bond feel to the proceedings. Make sure you check out the song in the ending credits. Very funny lyrics. "I wanna stretch my limo." Use the THX PRO LOGIC if you have it. The surround effects work GREAT. The game also has a WIDESCREEN setting.Why does everyone compare every game to HALO!?! Is this the only game people play? Okay, your loss.I haven't played the multi-player and I don't have broadband for online play, so I can't comment on those functions. But, if you love FPSs this may be right up your alley. IT'S DEFINITELY FUN!! And the PRICE IS RIGHT!!ENJOY!!

Yeah, sometimes the AI is stupid and sometimes the game doesn't move as fast as some people would like. But to me, KILLZONE is FPS (first person shooter) GOLD. It reminds me of the first TENCHU game. People said it was rough and unpolished, but it turned out to be one of the most amazing gameplay experiences I've ever had. The TENCHU series went downhill from there with analog controls and never lived up to the original. So don't wait for the second KILLZONE hoping there will be big improvements. You may be missing out. Don't listen to professional or jaded Amazon critics. People are just too picky. There are too many game geeks who don't like certain games because they don't live up to the expectations of some other game. Be fair. I don't care if KILLZONE is a HALO killer. IT'S NOT. And I don't care if this game pushes the PS2 to the limits of the hardware. IT DOES. To me, it's all about the gameplay. And I haven't been this immersed in a FPS since playing MEDAL OF HONOR FRONTLINE. THIS GAME SMOKES AND IT LOOKS HEAVY METAL PSYCHO!! BUT BE PREPARED TO DIE A FEW TIMES.I still play FRONTLINE so it took me a little time to get a handle on the controls. All movement for KILLZONE, like RED FACTION, is done via both analog sticks including side-to-side movement, which is actually more intuitive than the shoulder buttons utilized by FRONTLINE. After some practice with the controls all hell broke loose and those Helghast troops were dropping like flies. Occasionally I throw a grenade when I mean to sidestep enemy fire. Oops. One of the BEST features is the SENSITIVITY SETTING for X and Y axis, or up-and-down and side-to-side movement, which can be adjusted ingame in the ADVANCED SETTINGS during PAUSE. When I first started playing I had to set the SENSITIVITY very low, but as my learning curve improved I continued to raise the SENSITIVITY during gameplay. VERY NICE. ADVANCED SETTINGS are not in the MAIN MENU and are not fully explained in the MANUAL. For example: I turned ON the AUTO-CENTER feature in the ADVANCED SETTINGS and I assumed it was for auto-targeting. If it is, it doesn't work as I didn't notice any difference when it was turned OFF. Maybe another reviewer can enlighten me about this feature.Some complained about the reloading and grenade tossing animations being too slow and wrong for the game. It's realistic and part of the strategy. And it looks awesome. There's even a counter on grenades for when you're cooking one up. The AUTO-RELOAD feature can be turned OFF and reloading should be done while you are running or in a defilade position. And, if you take a lot of enemy fire your HEALTH BAR respawns after time.Some complained about the SNIPER RIFLE being too hard to aim. Again, it's realistic and requires a steady hand. Don't forget, like I did, to use the upward directional button after pressing R3 to FULLY ZOOM in on your target. It makes it much easier to get that KILLSHOT. Some of the STANDARD weapons also have a ZOOM feature with a press of the R3 button. It can be a little disorienting switching between ZOOM and NORMAL VIEW, but once you get used to it, it's a welcome feature.SOME SINGLE PLAYERS MAY WORRY about the ONLINE feature eating up a big portion of the gameplay. NEVER FEAR. KILLZONE GIVES YOU A LOT OF BANG FOR YOUR BUCK. The single player CAMPAIGN contains 11 HUGE levels that you can revisit at anytime after completion. (However, you'll lose your game in progress on a level if you go back.) The multiplayer BATTLEFIELDS contain 6 TEAM ARENAS that can be played ONLINE or OFFLINE, alone or with a friend. If you don't have a friend to play with or you have a friend who spends every waking hour playing and continually frags your sorry behind, every ARENA can be adjusted and played solo with AI bots, spawning, time limits, and more, depending on your skill level. You can also play as ISA goodguys or HELGHAN badboys. Nice, because the different factions use different weapons. So, you can pick-up, sample, and use them all. Even if you don't play ONLINE. (However, you can't play as Helghast in the CAMPAIGN mode.) PERFECT FOR THE CASUAL OR HARDCORE GAMER. Perfect for me, because I'm an older gamer and most of my friends are married with children and don't play video games. Suckers!! THANKS, GUERRILLA. I WAS WORRIED THERE FOR A MINUTE. GROWN MEN SHOULDN'T BE HAVING THIS MUCH FUN. (One of my older friends came by to check out the game and we ended up playing for 6 straight hours.)THE GRAPHICS ARE AMAZING. While answering a phone call, after just starting this game, I was watching the DEMOS on the MAIN MENU (I never pause my 41" SONY XBR TV ingame for long periods of time for fear of phosphor burn on my tube), and sat there slack-jawed. The graphics almost looked CELL-SHADED. INCREDIBLE. LIKE A HEAVY METAL OR ANIME CARTOON.Also includes a WIDESCREEN SETTING, DTS PRO LOGIC, and full CONTROLLER CUSTOMIZATION. SWEET.MOST PARENTS DON'T CARE, BUT HERE'S A WARNING: KILLZONE IS LOADED WITH FOUL LANGUAGE, ALTHOUGH THE VIOLENCE IS NOT GRAPHIC. THE BLOOD IS VERY SUBDUED. NO EXPLODING HEADS OR DISMEMBERED LIMBS. SO ACT ACCORDINGLY. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO LIKE THAT SORT OF THING: BUMMER. MAYBE NEXT TIME.IF YOU LOVE FPS's, THIS IS A MUST HAVE. I DON'T HAVE BROADBAND, SO BE SURE AND READ OTHER REVIEWS FOR ONLINE PLAY. KILLZONE WILL MAKE A GREAT HOLIDAY GIFT FOR THAT HARD-TO-BUY-FOR KILLER ON YOUR LIST. ENJOY.

In 1997, Intelligent Qube came out and completely took the puzzle world by storm.  Much like Tetris, Intelligence Qube was a game that was nothing short of simplistic.  Because of its simplistic formula, however, it was a widely addictive game that really forced you to use your brain.  Unfortunately, the game is extremely rare these days and like many rare highly sought after video games, comes at ridiculous prices.A game has never been simpler to learn than Intelligent Qube.  Each level has several rows.  Then the cubes begin to "march" forward.  The entire point of the game is to capture cubes.  You simply press X to lay down a trap and then X again to capture it.  There are a couple of complexities to the gameplay that make it quite a challenge.  For one, while your goal is to capture cubes, there are certain cubes that you shouldn't capture.  These are forbidden cubes, and the penalty for capturing one is losing a row of the level you're on.  There are also green cubes called advantage cubes.  Capturing these allows you to set a trap that will capture all the surrounding cubes.  At first, Intelligent Qube seems easy, but the game is much more complex than you think.  As the game progresses, the cubes march forward and there are more rows of cubes to deal with.  Just the same, the placement of the marching cubes is completely random.At times you may even have to run in between cubes to get to the ones you must capture in order to avoid forbidden cubes.  Should you ever get crushed by the cubes, they'll automatically roll off the edge of the stage and a row will collapse.  If that happens you'll have to go through the same set again.  If you successfully capture all cubes without capturing any forbidden cubes you'll gain another row.The game is very deep in its strategy.  It's a lot easier to screw up than it looks.  The game is not that long, but the levels can throw you for a loop.  Especially the advantage cube which will even capture forbidden cubes if they're in range.  There's really nothing more to the game than that.Graphically, Intelligent Qube looks incredibly smooth.  For a puzzle game like this, it looks top notch.  There's not a whole lot to the graphics, however as aside from the cubes and your little sprite running around there's nothing too complex to the graphics.However, the best part about Intelligent Qube is easily the soundtrack.  Beautifully orchestrated.  You'll be tempted to pause the game just to listen to the music of the stages.  This is easily one of the best sounding Playstation games ever releasedIn spite of its age, Intelligent Qube is still a great game.  If anyone is looking for a simple, yet addictive puzzle game, then you'll find it with this game.

Killzone, another FPS title for the console market exceeded my expectations in both graphics and gameplay. Granted the game has it weaknessess such as werid death animation and a couple of framerate issues here and there but what is clear is that the game really makes the PS2 engine work overtime in both presentation and gameplay.I would even say that parts of the game are very photo realistic and there were times in the game i just looked at a wall, a passage way or even the floor beneth me to admire how real it looked.From the moment you hit the warzone you are fully immersied in what is going on and you will be fully pumped for what comes after you have seen the elborate , overpowering but short intro which presents the simple premise of the helgast wanting to take over other colonised worlds in a grand royal battle that will leave the entire human race shellshocked. The whole game is set on one of these colonised planet call Vecta. The majority of the game takes place on this planet and really that is all there is too the story line besides some double crossing and inter-politics. But who cares???? If you want an elborate storyline go for a RPG. As first person shooter go this game rocks and really delivers gameplay that both casual and hardcore gamers can enjoy. The abilty to choose a difficulty level will asssist with your enjoyment of the game and the degree in which AI react. The Helgast on easy are fairly easy and can be knocked down pretty quickly but still, use of cover and the abiltity to re-load at the correct time is crucial. On the normal and harder difficulty levels you will truely notice the abilties of the AI to format thier stance based on your action including falling back, re-grouping, utilising cover, avoiding grenada and flanking.Voices can become repeative with the same quotes being used over and over again but i tend to ignore this due to the excellence in gameplay. Furthermore im a huge Halo fan and really though PS2 would never come close to that hit but Killzone is pretty dam close. In my personal judgement Halo and Halo 2 still provide a far greater storyline and intiutive gameplay but Killzone is its own experience that delivers.Yeah the reload annimation though impressive can be a bit of a bother at time in a rapid fire fight but this just makes you need to create strategies in which you can run to cover re-load and then attack again. Effective and makes sure you can never just run in gun and think you will get out. You wil need to plot and plan yah fire fights and this is alot of fun to do.The guns are great and i must saying after deciating a portion of my life to Halo it was nice to play with some decent milatary like guns instead of lazers.The game could have used a bit longer to process and develop. A longer more engrossing storyline would have been great and to move the field of combat to other planets or ship may have given the game a more epic quality but for what is it im not complaining to much and it does leave room for a sequal which id buy outrite.Overall i would have to say if you are a FPS fan or a gaming fan in general Killzone is a good night in and a good purchase. The game is not the longest but then i fall on to the side of debate that states i would rather play a short game that excels in what it does than play a 40 hours marathorn that has only about half of the decent gameplay. Furthermore with four playable characters, each with different skills leading to a different path through levels, it has good replay value and the sheer fun of gameplay will bring you back to play certain missions again.Killzone is enjoyable from start to finish !!!!!!Rent it or buy it but makes sure u get to see it !!!!!!!

The majority of the game takes place on this planet and really that is all there is too the story line besides some double crossing and inter-politics. But who cares???? If you want an elborate storyline go for a RPG. As first person shooter go this game rocks and really delivers gameplay that both casual and hardcore gamers can enjoy. The abilty to choose a difficulty level will asssist with your enjoyment of the game and the degree in which AI react. The Helgast on easy are fairly easy and can be knocked down pretty quickly but still, use of cover and the abiltity to re-load at the correct time is crucial. On the normal and harder difficulty levels you will truely notice the abilties of the AI to format thier stance based on your action including falling back, re-grouping, utilising cover, avoiding grenada and flanking.Voices can become repeative with the same quotes being used over and over again but i tend to ignore this due to the excellence in gameplay. Furthermore im a huge Halo fan and really though PS2 would never come close to that hit but Killzone is pretty dam close. In my personal judgement Halo and Halo 2 still provide a far greater storyline and intiutive gameplay but Killzone is its own experience that delivers.Yeah the reload annimation though impressive can be a bit of a bother at time in a rapid fire fight but this just makes you need to create strategies in which you can run to cover re-load and then attack again. Effective and makes sure you can never just run in gun and think you will get out. You wil need to plot and plan yah fire fights and this is alot of fun to do.The guns are great and i must saying after deciating a portion of my life to Halo it was nice to play with some decent milatary like guns instead of lazers.The game could have used a bit longer to process and develop. A longer more engrossing storyline would have been great and to move the field of combat to other planets or ship may have given the game a more epic quality but for what is it im not complaining to much and it does leave room for a sequal which id buy outrite.Overall i would have to say if you are a FPS fan or a gaming fan in general Killzone is a good night in and a good purchase. The game is not the longest but then i fall on to the side of debate that states i would rather play a short game that excels in what it does than play a 40 hours marathorn that has only about half of the decent gameplay. Furthermore with four playable characters, each with different skills leading to a different path through levels, it has good replay value and the sheer fun of gameplay will bring you back to play certain missions again.Killzone is enjoyable from start to finish !!!!!!Rent it or buy it but makes sure u get to see it !!!!!!!
This was the first (and only) puzzle game I've ever bought for a video game console, and it hooked me from the first five minutes of starting it up.The concept here is really simiple.  You're a tiny guy (or gal) on a big platform of blocks suspended in a world of darkness.  You're sitting there, minding your own buisness, when suddenly huge smashy blocks appear at the end of the platform, coming right towards you.  There's nowhere to hide, nowhere to run to.  Your only chance is to set explosive devices and destroy the blocks before they reach you.  If you fail...well, lets just say it won't be pretty.So you run around, frantically destroying the blocks before they reach and crush you.  It's very simple gameplay, but add in the fact that things go faster and faster, and the challenge gets harder and harder as the game goes on, and you've got a challenging game that's easy to learn, almost impossible to master.So we've got fun and challenging gameplay, but absoloutly terrible graphics.  By todays standards, Intelligent Qube is a visual mess.  The charachters are terrilbly ugly and everything has a first generation playstation look to it.  The game also gets impossibly hard as it goes on.  I never got past the fourth level, which says a lot about how hard this puzzle is.But the graphics and difficulty can be easily forgiven, considering how addictive and compelling the gameplay is.  In it's finest form, Intelligent Qube is a perfect example of superior gameplay over superior graphics.  This is one puzzler that stands the test of time quite well.

This game truly brings back old memories. But by todays video game standards, Medal of Honor Frontline has definitely seen it's day and you get kind of a been there, done that, feeling while you play it. Frontline's simple run and gun concept gives it more of an arcade-like experience, which definitely turns most gamers away, especially with games turning towards more of a realistic combat experience (Brothers in Arms, Ghost Recon, etc.) But the pure fun of running through it's linear levels blasting Germans away is what keeps it alive, making Frontline worth playing.The reason why my gameplay rating is low is because of Frontline's linear levels and simple game concept. In the game, you play as Lieutenant Jimmy Patterson, who is basically a one-man super soldier. Therefore, you pretty much go through missions alone and without allies, and when you do have fellow soldiers, you are still doing all the work. You can get shot hundreds of times and not be phased. This makes the game incredibly unrealistic. But on the plus side, the weapons, locations, and soldier uniforms are all fairly accurate at representing their real-life counterparts, which helps to add a much more realistic feel to the game. But still, for gamer's looking for a simple arcade-style shooter, look no further. But for those looking for more of a realistic simulation of WWII combat, I'd definitely recommend looking else-where, with my personal recommendation being either the Brothers in Arms or Call of Duty series.The graphics are actually not that bad, considering their age. While some landscapes and character models & animations may look ugly at times, they certainly get the job done. Weapon models look and feel surprisingly good and will show some resemblance to their real-life counterparts. Overall, the graphics look pretty good.The sound is one of the better portions of the game. All the weapons sound very good and help enhance the lacking gameplay. The voice-overs could use some work, but they at least help put some life to the characters. The music is great and fits the era and game perfectly.The bargain price of $10-$15 is probably worth the money to add this classic to your collection. The single-player isn't incredibly long, but the multi-player is pretty fun and should keep you busy for a while. The game doesn't have a whole lot to offer, so it might be better as a rental.The storyline isn't incredibly strong and could have been a lot better, but their is something about Frontline that makes it highly addicting. I don't know what it is about it, but it has an incredibly high tilt level and it is extremely fun to play, even if you are a one-man show.Medal of Honor Frontline used to be a great game in it's day. But like I said, with game's turning towards incredible realism and more life-like, non-linear, open-ended gameplay, Frontline definitely does not deliver. With it's linear, been there, done that, gameplay, Frontline doesn't appeal to most gamers. Despite these problems, the pure-fun of Frontline definitely makes it worth playing. This makes me believe that Medal of Honor Frontline will remain being an Xbox classic.

It has been said before, time after time that film-licence games disappoint.....HOWEVER....with the most lucrative of licences, EA has managed to conjure up a pretty solid title that will keep the fans happy. Looking at the screenplay for this game it is obvious that it is a very good-looking game. It may appear to be a RPG style game, but with lots of thinking and drawn-out fights involved, but you'll be pleased to hear this isn't the case. In this game there is a mix of a certain Golden Axe and Devil May Cry. You run around each environment, hacking and slashing at everything you see before facing a level guardian. Sound simple? To a certain extent it is, but in this day and age we tend to expect more, and EA comfortably delivers that.There are plenty of different moves to perform, including long-range attacks and short stabbing motions. However, in order to get a decent score at the end of the level and upgrade your character, you need to use a variety of attacks and keep your foes at bay the best you possibly can. This is all fine and dandy at first, but the game soon gets complicated, with Orcs popping out of the water you're wading through!MY VERDICT:Visuals: Fantastic effects with solid frame rate and smooth animations. Possibly the best aspect of the game.-(86%)Audio: The voice acting is top-notch and sounds just like the movie. Great.-(84%)Gameplay: Curiously hypnotic to play with loads of upgrades. Very good overall.-(80%)Lifespan: A complete and utter lack of replayability. Once you've played it, that's it....forgotten!-(71%)Originality: A time travel to the Eighties, if you can bear the perms, then it's good. Even though its origin is the film you can really say the film is not original! I have to give some credit!-(77%)OVERALL SCORE AND THOUGHTS:-7.9/10_(79%)lacking multiplayer is a serious letdown, but it's brilliant fun while it lasts, especially for fans!

Before I go any further I just want to state that my son is the one who plays this game, I do occasionally play the game at his instance.Anyways, my son (Age 13) had recieved this game from a friend who at the time did not own a PC with the correct graphics card to play it. So he gave it to my son since he knew that his PC's were very capable of playing this game and he has been playing it to death ever since. He primarily plays the game on-line against other players in campaign mode and loves the variety of maps, choice of weapons, and different vehicles (including helicopters and Jet Airplanes). The Graphics for this game is still very good and looks great on a ATI 4000 series or higher Video Card, Ok granted it's not going to look like or hold a torch to Battlefield 3's graphics but for a 7 year old game it still looks good.He so loves this game so much he brought a copy of the game for his laptop and got his sister (Age 9) hooked on the game so she ended up buying the Game for herself and put it on her laptop. Now he has LAN partys with his friends and family at the house.FOR WINDOWS VISTA and 7 users PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING !!! (see Below)This game was originally designed to play on Windows XP (32 bit version) when released 7 years ago, However this WILL work with Windows Vista and Windows 7. First make sure the PC you are loading is connected to the internet, Then go to install the game and enter your product keys as normal but durring the install you may recieve some warning erros like "Only tested on Windows XP 32 Bit", "Can't open **** file", and so forth. Just hit the "OK" or "Ignore" buttons until it gets through the installation. It will then start querying the EA Battlefield 2 servers for the upgrade patches for the game and let you know when to install. THis may take serval minutes in between each patch so be patient and most importantly DO NOT EXIT THE INSTALL Windows. The entire process may take up to 60 to 90 minutes to complete. When completed it will indicate installtion complete and you should be able to start the game and start playing.The minimum system requirements are as follows for your PC Rig...CPU: Intel Pentium 4 or Celeron D CPU 1.7 GHz along with AMD Athlon XP or Sempron EquivilantRAM: 512 MB (Windows XP) 1GB (Windows Vista or Windows 7)Harddrive: 2.3 GB hard disk space (Probably 3GB needed after patching)Videocard: Radeon 8500 or GeForce FX 5700 DirectX compatible 128 MB graphics card or higher (Intergrated Intel Graphics Cards are NOT Supported by this game)Operating Systems: Windows XP (32 and 64 bit), Windows Vista (32 or 64 bit)*, Windows 7 (32 or 64 bit)** For Windows Vista and Windows 7 all applicable patches must be downloaded and applied first for Battlefield 2 to work on these two operating systems, In it's "Out of the box" state it will only work with Windows XP (32 Bit).So far I have only installed it on 32 Bit versions of Windows 7 however I will update this when I get ready to install this on my son's new 64 bit desktop (This is primarlily being done so he can play the new Battlefield 3).**** Updated 11/14/2011 - Just got thru loading this on my son's new desktop running Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 (64 Bit), did not have one problem with the install or running the game afterwards.Here are the Specs of the PC's Me and my son have loaded on so far with success...System Specs: My Sons DesktopIntel Core Dou 2 Quad socket 775, 6mb cache processorIntel DP43TF MOBO8GB of DDR2 800mhz PC6400 RAM750W Antec PSU750GB SATA HDD24bit 5.1 Creative Sound Card1GB intergrated Intel NICATI Radeon HD 6450 PCI-E 1GBWindows 7 Ultimate SP1 (64 Bit)27inch LCD VE276Q ASUS Monitor.System Specs: My Daughter's DesktopP4 3.4GHZ HT socket 478, 1 MB cache processorINTEL 865 PERLK MOBO4GB of DDR1 400mhz PC3200 RAM680W PSU300GB SATA HDD24bit 5.1 Creative Sound CardEdimax Wi-Fi Card1GB intergrated Intel NICATI Radeon HD 3850 AGP 512mbWindows 7 Ultimate SP1 (32 Bit)System Specs: My Son's LaptopDell Inspiron 1720Intel Centrino Core Duo 2 2.4 ghz processor4GB DDR2 Laptop Memory256 mb NVidia 8600m Video Card500GB Boot Drive/ 80GB Data DriveDVD/CD Burner100mb Intergrated Broadcom Nic54mbs Intel WiFi Card17 inch LCD ScreenWindows 7 Professional SP1 (32 Bit)System Specs: My Daughters LaptopDell Inspiron 1545I3 Core 2.53 ghz processor512MB ATI 4650 Video Card4 GB Of DDR3 RAM PC 10666320GB Hard Drive100mb intergrated NIC15.6 inch LCD WidescreenDVD/CD Burner54mbs Intel WiFi CardWindows 7 Professional SP1 (32 Bit)System Specs: My Sons Friends DesktopHP DC 7800 Minitower WorkstationIntel Core Duo 2 Dual Core 2.33ghz processor4 GB DDR2 667mhz PC 5300 RAM256MB Nvidia Quadro FX 1500 Video Card1GB intergrated NIC320GB Hard Drive54mbs USB Wifi CardWindows 7 Professional SP1 (32 Bit)
"Jane's F/A-18" is one of the most challenging and complex military flight-sims around these days - rivaling "Falcon 4.0" and "Flanker 2" in that respect.  Here you get to fly the F-18E, the newest version of the Hornet (distinguished by its larger size and square intakes), one that takes the can-do capability of older F/A-18C's and ups everything up a notch.This sim is no mid-level game - certainly nothing like other Jane's "Fighters" titles (ATF, IAF, USNF '97), and being much closer to the superb but daunting "Jane's F-15".  Here, you will manage the F-18E's mind boggling array of avionics and weapons.  Did you think that the "multi" in multi-mode radar means that you can scan both air and ground targets?  Forget it - in counter-air alone, you'll learn about ACQ, Track-While-Scan and RWS modes (and there's probably at least one more).  The sensor suite alone requires a tutorial that will keep you occupied long after your dream computer is overtaken by the latest Pentium.  Then there's the opposition: I may just be a novice, but those MiGs know how to work in hunter-killer teams, and since this is a Jane's game, your enemy will fire at you like you're their only enemy (boys! boys! save some SAMs for China!!).  Then there's the game's ace-in-the-whole, the F/A-18E itself.  Visually, the machine's a stunner in every way (I'm talking about its graphical representation; I don't think the real plane is all that pretty), both inside and out.  To match its complex avionics, the jet is blessed with an almost completely click-functional flight panel.  On the outside, you can almost smell that sheen of gull-gray paint (as on Falcon 4, you can customize your jet's skins).  Handling wise, the F-18 here reveals the extent of the game's hardcore realism: if you came of age playing flight-sims of easily maneuverable fighter jets, keep away: Jane's F-18 is no easy performer.  Instead, lose airspeed, and you nimble jet will become as agile as a UPS truck with wings.  Think you're flying straight and level just because your jet's nose is right on the horizon?  Not a chance - in this game, you're either about to get holed up by a missile or pancake right into the ground.  Think you can defeat enemy MiGs using the old banking-turn?  No way, you're not safe using that maneuver.  You're never safe in this game.  This is flight simulation with an accent on "flight".  And let's not forget that you'll spend a fair amount of time on this game learning to grease your wonder-plane onto stretch of runway about as long as a football field from a speed of about 180 knots (if you really needed to be reminded that a game about F-18's will require you to land on aircraft carriers, it's only one more sign that this is really not for you).If F-18, has one realism lapse it's one inherited from "Jane's F-15" - there's no training module!  You get the expected "instant action", "single missions", "campaign" and "multi-player" with which you and your high-tech nightmare plane can burn up the sky, but nothing beside a few basic combat missions designed to teach you how to fly and fight your plane.  We're supposed to learn as we go in the single missions, on the idea that they are simulations - but why remind us that the whole game is a simulation?.  They could have had you fly "real" flights that were designed as training hops (like the paper targets in "Iron Eagle" or against drone planes or in gunnery missions against towed banners) in F-18's with training skins (high-vis colors on wing tips).  That way, there could have been a dynamite training module which would have reinforced the game's otherwise winning brand of verisimilitude.  It's just annoying that Jane's went to the trouble of crafting a truly deep and detailed flight-sim, and gave it nothing better to do than blow everything up.Graphically, the rest of the game is beautiful - especially the flaming effects of missiles and destroyed airplanes.  Ground terrain is nice, but not spectacular, while the upper atmosphere looks tantalizingly beautiful.  While F-18 fits the same genre of extreme flight-sim occupied by Flanker2 and Falcon4 (which came out at about the same time), OpenGL graphics accelerator support sets Jane's game apart from those other ganmes which only really come alive under the older "Glide" system used on 3DFx graphics cards (Falcon will fly on my system, but not in Graphics Hardware Acceleration  mode).  I "flew" this game on my Win XP Pentium4 and eventually overcame WinXP compatibility problems (XP users will need to find a patch file first).  Both this and Falcon 4 are worthwhile games - though the other game suffers for its slavish adherence to 3DFx cards.  Also, Falcon has spawned a larger cult following than Jane's F/A-18, which means much more meaningful 3rd party files on the internet.  Still, the thrill of naval aviation (and OpenGL) are enough to keep this reviewer's attention.  I don't recommend you buy both programs (you'll have your hands full trying to master one of them), only that you see what your graphics accelerator is, and choose accordingly.  For owners of GeForce or other cards using OpenGL, the choice is clear - "Jane's F/A-18".

I was uneasy about buying this game after reading all of the negative reviews. I hate to hurt any ones feeling, but this game run smoother than Battlefield 1942. If this will help any of you gamers, Here We go..... I running windows 98...with a 2.6ghz processor...Nvidia geforce Ti-4600 128 megs video card, sound blaster 512 sound card..... 512 megs of DDR rams for memory....2x...4x AGP.....52x cdrom,...400mhz frntside bus.........After I installed the game I changed the settings, as follows....... set resolution to= 800x600x16 bits...set sound=44 hzs....turned shadows and lightmap off....set graphics=medium..set bot level=14......If you will check out these settings,you might just get your game running better, I hope this help, Thank You Romeo H Faison. One more point, You gamers have got to remember, You have got to break a game in ,the same as you would break a new car in. The more you play the game the better it will problably run on your computer. One more thing ,right click on my computer, hit the performance tab, make sure the sytem resource is at least 93%.If it is under 90% ,Hit control,alt delete at the same time to see what is running in the background, play around with this a bit.,Shut down some of the programs that are running in the background,but make sure you do not shut down, system tray, and explorer. Somtimes there are programs running on your computer, that you may be unaware of , in this case go to the system configuration utility. , and hit the system startup tab, look at some of the programs running in the background, uncheck some of these programs,using some common sense, always leave system tray and etc;,Finally remember you have ,its a must ,play the game until you feel you have broken it in to your computer, Sometimes you can turn the game on high afterwards. P.S. I have never put a patch on this game, this is the only new game, that I have never patched, You can always set the resolution to 640x480x16 bits, its not going to change the graphics guality that much, it won"t be noticeable by any means. I have over a 100 games, I knows how to make a game work,play around with the # of bots, or soldiers in the game, when you get close to a tank you will problably, you will notice a slight dip in the framerate. One last point of interest,driving vehicles,flying planes,helicopter is best, if using a joystick, especially the tanks,inboth bf1942,and bfvietnam......PEACE:

Since most everyone already knows nearly every detail about the game itself (if you don't, read the other reviews), all I'll add is that I just purchased my copy of this complete collection (from here on Amazon), and EA has updated the product to now include all reg codes.  The booklet that comes with the game has 3 reg codes printed on the back cover:  One for BF2 itself, another for BF2:SF expansion, and a third code for the BF2:AAF and BF2:EF booster packs, all 3 very clearly specified.Also, Patch 1.41 is included and automatically applied during the install.  If you only install BF2, patch 1.41 is automatically run by the installer and the end of the install.  Additionall, Patch 1.41 will also be run if you also install Special Forces and also again if you install the booster packs.  If you do a "kitchen sink" install of everything, the installer will run Patch 1.41 3 times.  Installing this full product on my machine took a while, and I have a smokin' dual-core box with hot SATA, 2G RAM, dual-SLI nvidia 8600's, blah blah blah and a partridge in a pear tree.  The install is not quick, is rather redundant with the re-application of the 1.41 patch several times, but everything works at the end of the install.  All previous complaints that people have been whining about in here (outside of gameplay itself) have been addressed with this release from EA.So for anyone worried about not getting all of the reg codes along with the product, this is no longer a problem and you may order this product with confidence.  I have to admit, this was a pleasant and unexpected surprise - a refreshing change from all the crap EA's been shamelessly perpetrating on their customers recently (Crysis excluded, they actually got that one right).
I know that this game is supposedly filled with bugs but how come I didn't get any? I have whole mess of computers because my friend works in a Cyberpower inc, and I tried it on one of the most cheap computers that I had. It was only AMD Athlon 2000+, 512mb ram, GeForce 4 MX 440 64mb, with DSL and I was able to run it with no bugs, no lags, and on medium settings. But you guys who whines that this game is filled with bugs, try to see if your system meets the requirments. If it does, then try to see if there is anything else wrong with your PC. But if the game is still not working or has bugs, try downloading a patch or return it. You guys don't have to make bad comments and rate it bad just because it doesn't run on your PC and it does on mine. If you didn't play the game itself you shouldn't rate it.Now back to the game itself, this game is amazing. I have played it and enjoyed every minute playing this game. It's so much better than Battlefield 1942 because you have newer weapons, more maps, and different vehicles. Not only that, you will have more wide variety of tactics such as the Vietcong's Hit and Run or set up a trap with logs. It definitly has better sounds with radios in vehicles and better graphics. And no, it doesn't have worse graphics then Battlefield 1942. Oh crap, I have to go. Just make sure you have better computer than Pentium 3 1.4 or Athlon XP 1600+ with 512mb ram, GeForce 4 TI and Radeon 9000 or higher with DSL or higher connection to play without so much lags. The reason why the graphics reccomendation is so high is because this will make a big diffrence in the game. If you only have a GeForce 2, 3, Radeon 8500 or lower, it might not run very fast. To play it on highest settings with no lags, get at least Athlon XP 3200+, 1GB ram, Radeon 9600XT or GeForce 5700 Ultra with cable modem. Hope you enjoy the game and make sure you have at least my requirements to play with no lags. But you might have to play on low settings.

BF2 and BF2 SF are the best FPS war game with fun multiplayer. Let me tell you my story about playing this game. I was using Geforce 5600 ultra with 1 Gig ram on P4 3.2Ghz machine. It was set at medium setting with 800x600 resolution and no lag on mutiplayer. Then I decided to upgrade my video card to Geforce 6800GT 256MB. The graphic was set at highest and resolution also highest with no problem when play single player game. But when I tried multiplayer game, it was laggy, especially the night mission with night vision on. The graphic was still very good but with occasional stuttering and I heard my hard drive making busy noise. I know what happened. I loaded the window xp task manager to see the RAM usage history indicated it was 1.2 GB while I was running multiplayer with 64 player big map. Guys! BF2 really needs more than 1 GiG to play the online 64 player map. I purchased 1 more Gig Ram and put them on..Geee. it is very very very..damn smooth multiplayer gaming experience very the top, highest graphic turn on. Now I am experiencing highest BF2 graphic with smoothest, fastest game play. It is truth and it is my real experience. Go to get another Gig of ram. it is about $ 78-89 USD now everywhere on 2x512mb dual channel PC3200 modules. Of course, may be it is still expensive for some people, but this is the way if you really want to play BF2 with the best graphic. 2 Gig Ram is the future PC game play. Time to upgrade and make it ready for the next coming year.
After having played this game for a couple of weeks, I am very happy with it. After finishing the game, going back and playing some levels is a lot of fun. The graphics are breath-taking, as is the realism of physical objects.The game is very demanding on the system. I have a nVidia 680i MB, Q6600 CPU, 2 Gigs of RAM, and an eVGA 8800 GTX card. I run the system slightly overclocked (no extra cooling). The FSB runs at 299 (instead of stock 267) using nTune. I also OC the graphics card: Core 625 instead of 575, Memory at 2020 instead of 1800 and Shader clock at 1575 instead of 1350. It runs very stable at these settings. I use Vista 32-bit.I run at 1920x1200 - no AA. All settings at Very High, except for Shadows(Medium) and Shader(High). I prefer the shadows at medium as they are accurate and sharp. I also prefer the shader at High (Very High creates motion blur effect, which is cool, but the framerates drop, andI could not tell any visual difference.)I get about 19-32 FPS, mostly around 24-27. From the Task Manager, I change the process priority to High (instead of Normal). I also notice that typically one of the CPU cores runs close to 100% while other cores run low. Sometimes all cores seem to participate, but mostly the load is on one. I have a dual boot system with Vista 64-bit, and on that the cores seem to be loaded in a more balanced way by Crysis, none maxing out. However, I did not find the framerate to be any higher on the 64-bit instance. So I am sticking to Vista 32-bit for now.When the Crysis patch comes out I expect the cores will be loaded in a balanced way on the 32-bit system as well. Maybe the framerate will also go up by about 5 or so. I did play around with the process Affinity (you can select which cores you want it to run on). When I pick the two middle ones, sometimes it balances nicely between the two (roughly 70-30). So I am not sure why when all four cores are chosen, it loads only one primarily). Maybe it has to do with where it is in a level and what is going on on the screen at that time.I can tell a LOT OF WORK has gone into making this game. After finishing it, replaying missions makes you explore more and try different things, which is a blast. As time passes in a level that starts at dawn time, and the sun comes out, the scenery is simply amazing.This game gets a 10/10 from me.

&quot;Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003&quot; is another great title that's a part of the Nintendo GameCube library (although not exclusively).  Prior to getting this game, the only types of video golf I had played were a mini-putt game online and the barroom staple, &quot;Golden Tee&quot;.  This game far exceeds and of those and probably most other golf games as well.  It's very easy to make a sporting video game unpleasant to play (see the Acclaim series of baseball games for example).  The game can be too simply, thereby removing any significant challenge for the user.  Or, the game can be made too complex, causing the user to get frustrated and not want to take the time and effort to learn how to play the game (once again, the Acclaim baseball games suffer this fate).  The key is striking a balance between challenge and simplicity.  &quot;...PGA Tour 2003&quot; succeeds here because goes for simplicity in the basic mechanics of the golf and putt swings, but employs challenges it the form of weather conditions, course setup, skill of opposing golfer, etc.  If the mere mechanics of the swing were so complex that it would take a physically gifted athlete to master them, then the user would not play this game.  However, since the challenge exists in the other variables, the user can get comfortable with the mechanics and then can go about figuring out how to beat the courses and other golfers.&quot;...PGA Tour 2003&quot; employs spectacular graphics as it takes the user all over the world to some of the most famous golf courses in existence.  Pebble Beach, St. Andrews, and Royal Birkdale are just a few of the courses that are available for play.  Most of the courses are locked and it takes winning certain amounts of money and success in the 'Tiger Challenge' to unlock them (in addition to new equipment and golfers).  The graphics make it seem like you are standing at the tees of each of these courses.  Sunlight, cloud cover, rain, fans, rodents running across the fairway all make for an enhancement experience.  The features on the golfing opponents are quite lifelike, too.  From known golfers to fictional ones, &quot;...PGA Tour&quot; creates very real opponents (the female golfers they come up with are pretty sweet, too *wink* *wink*).The real 'ace-in-the-hole' for this game is the 'Tiger Challenge'.  In this format, you get to face off in individual match play format against a number of golfers as you earn higher rankings on the tour and more money.  Most of these matches are, indeed, 9- or 18-hole match play matches.  However, there are other matches thrown in for variety.  There are 'Skins' games matches where golfers you have already defeated challenge you again in a four-person battle for money.  There are also tournament matches that allow you to achieve certain goals and even more money.  Unlike match play, though, you are not required to win these variations in order to move on to the next opponent.  It's just something fun to engage in.  The 'Tiger Challenge' offers a lot in terms of...well...challenge.  Some of these opponents will be quite difficult to defeat, so strategy becomes as much a part of the games as long drives and short putts.  It took me more than 20 tries to defeat 'Mulligan' McGregor and more than 40 tries to defeat Brad Faxon, but the knowledge I developed in learning how to master specific course, weather conditions, and hole-by-hole scenarios outweighed the frustration of playing them multiple times and will actually provide me with strategic planning the next time I play golf for real.In addition to the numerous courses to be played and the 'Tiger Challenge', there are many other features in this game.  There is a 'skillzone' mode where you can practice your accuracy, a 'speed golf' mode that puts a different spin on playing through, and various match, stroke, skins, and tournament modes that can provide a different approach to playing the game.  On top of these, there are a number of rewards that the user can go after.  There are 'scenario medals' where the user is presented with any one of 53 different situations and his or her performance will determine if they get a gold, silver, or bronze medal or any at all.  There are also 'trophy balls' awarded for any number of accomplishments like a bogey-free round, a double eagle, all fairways hit in regulation, and a hole-in-one to name a few.  There is a lot of money to be earned when any one of these 'trophy balls' is earned and it will allow the user to improve their game by buying more attributes for their golfer.It's hard to think of what else there is to add to the superlatives already heaped on this game.  Yet, I do not think it would be hyperbole to say that may be one of the best video sporting games I have ever played.

Tiger Woods still leads the pack in golfing SIMS for PlayStation and XBox. Still a great game, lots of fun, decent graphics, and more importantly - still a challenge. I gave '04 and '05 both 5-star reviews... '06 is close at 4.5 stars... as is this '07 at 4.5 stars. Each year, there's not a game I look more forward to coming out than Tiger Woods' golf game. Here's the breakdown as I see it on Tiger Woods PGA 2007.GOLF COURSES: 21 total courses (7 new courses). New courses include Aviara (California), The Falls (Las Vegas), The K Club (Ireland), Kiawah Island (Hawaii), The National (Australia), The Riviera CC (California) and The Safari (fictional). Several of the classic courses are back on '07 - including Pebble Beach, TPC at Sawgrass, Harbor Town, Pumpkin Ridge, St Andrews, etc... as well as the Central Park course and The Predator. There are 15 PGA players to unlock. The commentator team of McCord and Feherty are back (though many of their phrases are the same from '05 and '06).GAME FACE, EQUIPMENT, GAME MODES: I see no noticeable improvement in the graphics department moving from '06 to the '07 game. Perhaps the PS2 has peaked in the graphics area - and the real improvements are reserved for PS3. Gone are the old timers (Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, etc) that the '06 featured. All the things you could do in '05 and '06 with the face and body are here, however you're only given one head to alter (and a lot of the altering is with the analog sticks instead of scrolling up and down, so it's not as precise). Gone is the "Game Breaker Meter" and "Voice" of the player (both from '06). Clothing, club selection and the misc golf gear is extensive and all the top major golfing brands are here (Callaway, Ping, Taylor-Made, etc). Game modes include the standards: PGA Tour/Season, Traditional (8 games including Match/Skins/etc), Battle Golf, Real Time Event Calendar, Skills 18, and new in '07 - Team Tour, One Ball, Team One Ball, Elimination Mode, and several new games under the 'traditional' category including Bloodsome, Greensome, Stableford, Best Ball and Four Ball. For me, the new game of "One Ball" is/was the best addition - a strategic game where multiple gamers playing a single ball, and each shot must land within a circle whose radius is half the distance to the pin and where holing out scores the most points. As in '06, there is a "Save Progress" button allowing you to stop play at any given time.PUTTING: New in '07 - you get to choose - do you want to put like the '06 game is set up, or like the '05 game (too bad - no caddy tips)? As in '06, you'll need to read the greens and judge the distance to the cup before each putt. You'll need to look at all the info on the screen when putting - grid with sloping beads, camera angles, distance from the cup, and strength of shot. When putting, press the "X" button to show the ideal line/path to the hole. You'll have to judge how far left or right to move the blue arrow. Like the swing control of all your other clubs, you'll need to determine the power of your putts by how far you pull back on your putter. I actually prefer the newer way of putting (from '06) and I've gotten used to it...in my opinion, there's more info on the screen for you to make better putts using this method.SWING CONTROLS: Same as 2006 - your left analog stick still controls the back swing and downswing, as well as your hook and slice; while the right analog stick determines where the club hits the ball. If you don't use the right analog stick (which will be a majority of your shots), you'll hit in the middle of the ball. I feel the right analog stick is more for those strategic shots when you're close to a tree and you need extra loft to get over it, or you're under a tree and you need to punch a line drive to get out from underneath. It's virtually impossible to hit a strategic shot like this with both thumbs on the analog controls AND power up on the L1 button for a stronger shot. You can still choose how you want to hit the ball (full swing, punch, pitch, flop, chip and putt). One nice thing I've noticed - in previous years the game would decide if and when you could use your putter. In '06 as well as '07, you make the choice where to use your putter... even from several feet off the green.SKILL TOKENS: Same as 2006 - gone are the days of earning cash from tournaments and buying literally whatever attributes you want. When you hit a good shot, you will earn skill token(s) for that type of shot. There are 6 categories in which to earn tokens for and improve your golfers performance: General, Power, Accuracy, Putting, Spin, and Concentration. Wagering $$$ - while playing against another player, you can increase your paycheck each time you play, you can wager on every round or even every hole.THE GOOD: Navigating through the screen menus is much easier in '07. The cumbersome and often times frustrating "Clubhouse" from '06 is gone. There are fewer clothing items to choose from (do we really need 150 different shirts?). "Speed Play" quickens the time and you can skip all the post celebrations if you want (with a click of the R1 button). The new games (Team Tour, One Ball, etc) offered are great and I find the game play here is amazingly deep. The new courses are cool - although I must admit I was hoping "The National" course was the one on eastern Long Island (NY), not the one from Australia. '07 includes tutorials - a description and example of each shot and type of game (i.e. flop, punch, pitch, spin control, "Bloodsome", Skills 18, etc)... great for novices of the sport. The EA Sports Trax (music) has changed for the better... it's all fairly low key instrumentals by obscure bands/people (Fort Knox Five, Way Out West, Hexstatic, etc)... gone is the annoying rap and hip-hop from previous years.THE BAD: The announcers' dialogue was often wrong - "Finishes at even par today" when I'm on the 6th hole? "That's just a bad shot" when I leave a shot 4 feet from the pin from 150 yards out? I found the announcers chatter extremely repetitive and frequently turn them off. No big changes in the graphics from '06. All the characters still have a stiff neck. On the '07 game, when you change clothes or clubs, you need to change and adjust the attributes that go with it (this was new on the '06 game) - you need to do this in order to get the best performance from your player. I (still) found this to be a huge waste of time. Many of the trophy balls you earn are a meager $50 or $100... and they simply don't buy much (a hat maybe?). Between screens prepare to wait 20+ seconds every time while the system "checks for memory card" and then "saves data". Once or twice during an 18-hole match, my ball would be on the fringe of the green - and it gave me a weird angle from across the green (and I could not change it) - making for a very difficult shot. Perhaps the game is getting too easy when my young player at a rating of 70 can beat Vijay Singh (rating of 83) by eight strokes. I really miss the old time golfers (Palmer, Nicklaus, etc) from '06. The booklet that comes with the game is thin at only 10-pages and in black & white only... it only touches on the features... I learned more about the new features while actually IN the game and trying stuff out.OVERALL: There are several changes from '06. Some good, some bad... but, mostly for the better. The few new features and the new golf courses make this a must have for those that like the Tiger Woods PGA series... still the best golf game on the market (4.5 stars).
Tiger Woods still leads the pack in golfing SIMS for PS2 and XBox. Still a great game, lots of fun, decent graphics, and more importantly - still a challenge. I've given the previous two years 5-star reviews... and this '06 is close at 4.5 stars. Each year, there's not a game I look more forward to coming out than Tiger Woods' golf game. There's no other game I look forward to playing with friends. Here's the breakdown as I see it.GOLF COURSES: 11 licensed courses (15 total courses). New courses include Doral Golf Resort (Miami, FL), Reflection Bay (Las Vegas, NV), TPC Sawgrass (Ponte Verde Beach, FL), Pumpkin Ridge (Portland, OR), Sahalee CC (Seattle, WA), Cog Hill CC (Chicago, IL), and Britain's own St Andrews. There are 17 PGA players to unlock. The commentator team of McCord and Feherty are back (though many of their phrases are the same from '05).GAME FACE, EQUIPMENT, GAME MODES: The graphics are a tad better than '05. Dare I say the texture of the faces remind me of when Homer Simpson went 3-D in that "Tron" episode a few years back. Almost, but not quite. Some characters look better than others - Arnold Palmer looks great, but Jack Nichlaus looks sickly. All the things you could do in '05 with the face and body are here. The new feature here is the "voice" of your player. You can listen to your guy yell as he makes a good (or bad) shot. Clothing, club selection and the misc golf gear is extensive and all the top major golfing brands are here (Callaway, Ping, Taylor-Made, etc). Game modes include the standards: PGA Tour/Season, Traditional (8 games including Match/Skins/etc), Battle Golf, Real Time Event Calendar, and new in '06 a "Skills 18" which is a variation of stroke play where you are trying to get your ball through colored hoops along the course for extra cash. There is also a game mode you can turn on called "Reactive Tiger" - the better you play, the tougher each hole becomes (and vice versa). As in '05, once you've progressed through much of the game, you'll be able to play the true PGA legends (Nicklaus, Palmer, Hogan, Woods, etc). New in '06 is a "Save Progress" button allowing you to stop play at any given time - all I can say here is it's about time (previous years did NOT have this option).PUTTING: Gone are the "Caddy Tips" from previous years. You'll need to read the greens and judge the distance to the cup before each putt. You'll need to look at all the info on the screen when putting - grid with sloping beads, camera angles, distance from the cup, and strength of shot. When putting, press the "X" button to show the ideal line/path to the hole. You'll have to judge how far left or right to move the blue arrow. Like the swing control of all your other clubs, you'll need to determine the power of your putts by how far you pull back on your putter. After many rounds, I've gotten used to the whole aspect of '06 putting... and it's not that difficult. In fact, there's MORE info on the screen for you to make better putts.SWING CONTROLS: The game box and the commercial I saw made me think the whole swing had changed from years past. Yes and no. Your left analog stick still controls the back swing and downswing, as well as your hook and slice; while the right analog stick determines where the club hits the ball. If you don't use the right analog stick (which will be a majority of your shots), you'll hit in the middle of the ball. I feel the right analog stick is more for those strategic shots when you're close to a tree and you need extra loft to get over it, or you're under a tree and you need to punch a line drive to get out from underneath. It's virtually impossible to hit a strategic shot like this with both thumbs on the analog controls AND power up on the L1 button for a stronger shot. You can still choose how you want to hit the ball (full swing, punch, pitch, flop, chip and putt). One nice thing I've noticed - in previous years the game would decide if and when you could use your putter. In '06, you make the choice where to use your putter... even from several feet off the green.SKILL TOKENS: Gone are the days of earning cash from tournaments and buying literally whatever attributes you want. In '06, when you hit a good shot, you will earn skill token(s) for that type of shot. There are 6 categories in which to earn tokens for and improve your golfers performance: General, Power, Accuracy, Putting, Spin, and Concentration. I'm sitting on the fence about this change. Tougher - yes. Wagering $$$ - while playing against another player, you can increase your paycheck each time you play, you can wager on every round or even every hole.THE NEGATIVES: Navigating around the new "Clubhouse" can be frustrating. At first, I kind of felt lost... like, where exactly should I be going? You can visit the "Era Specific" pro shop, accept a challenge, enter the rivals mode, or review your trophy case. Once you do well in one era, a note will pop up saying "Tiger has left this era" and you'll have to figure out where to go next. Not user friendly in my opinion. The "Gamebreaker Meter" is close to being worthless. The back of the box brags about this feature. You'll be lucky to fill the meter once (maybe twice if you're really playing well) in 18 holes. Tap the "X" button during your swing and your shot goes a little farther and a little straighter. If you match your skill with a little luck on any given par 3, you can use your full "Meter" for a hole-in-one. In two months use, I have 3x the number of hole-in-ones than the previous 2005 game. You can also hit the "Gamebreaker Meter" when your opponent is about to swing - emptying his meter (yawn). The vibration "heartbeat" on a big clutch shot is downright annoying - it almost shakes too much, plus the screen flickers. As good as the graphics are, when I use my driver and hit the ball from the tee, the ball flying through the air - the picture always freezes for a second and then continues... I don't know if this is my PS2 system or simply the mechanics of the game. Seems like every 2nd or 3rd shot I take, someone in the crowd yells "I love this game!" Somehow, with this game being bigger and better than any of the previous releases, there'd be more variety of words spoken and less repetition. Sadly, this is simply not true. When you change clothes or clubs, you need to change and adjust the attributes that go with it - you need to do this in order to get the best performance from your player. I found this to be a huge waste of time. However, the biggest down side to Tiger '06 is that it takes longer to play than previous releases. Where I used to be able to play 18 holes in 20 minutes, it now takes 30. Hitting the "X" button to skip the celebrations or warm-ups, your player tying their shoe or picking up their ball after you sink a putt doesn't seem to work - you are forced to watch these now. It slows the game down considerably.OVERVIEW: The first few writers here have given this game poor reviews. I disagree. There are a few things here that they've changed from '05 (some good, some bad), but overall this is still a great game. The negatives mentioned above are minor in my opinion. The '06 is definitely as tough or tougher than previous years. Tiger Woods is still the best golf game on the market. If you loved Tiger's games in previous years, you'll love this game too.
Let's get one thing straight: I've never given two shakes about golf, either in real-life or video game form.  I'd never played a golf game until Hot Shots Golf 3.  This review will show my lack of knowledge about the sport, and will contain no comparisons to Swing Away Golf, Tiger Woods 2002, Tee Off Golf, or even the first two Hot Shots games, because I've never spent one second playing any of them.  In fact, being Golf Ignoramus #1, I may seem like the least qualified person in the universe to review this game.However, HSG3 is not a golf game just for golf-heads.  It is fun, pure and simple - in fact, it's the most fun I've had with a game since Samba de Amigo and Virtua Tennis on the Dreamcast.  HSG3 is one of only two games I've ever pre-ordered; even now I'm really perplexed about what attracted me to it.  I was positive the game would be a winner.Lucky for me, I was right.  HSG3 makes golf fun and easy to play, yet contains enough depth to keep it from being silly.  It's a fantastic multiplayer game as well - my similarly golf-ignorant friends got involved immediately.  We now consider it a multiplayer classic.First off, the game is gorgeous to look at.  The characters have goofy, oversized heads, and behave in bizarre, endearing ways.  They'll do backflips when you get a birdy, and will even line-dance with some frogs.  The game is full of visual whimsy: a rainbow trail follows the ball on an accurate stroke, your caddy kicks up a puff of dust as he takes off after the ball, and the golf ball will even burst into flames on certain occasions.  The true stars of the game are the courses: lush, detail-filled marvels that are just magnificent.  I was actually disappointed my character couldn't hop in the golf cart and take a leisurely tour of the course, drinking in the grassy, rolling hills, the swaying trees, butterflies, falling leaves, rippling pools, and the glorious sunset.  You might see a windmill turning lazily in the distance, or a train chugging along a winding track.  You'll hear buzzing insects, soft gusts of wind...and your caddie's grating comments when you launch one into the rough.  The courses vary from a tropical island to a desert canyon, and each has its own treasures and obstacles.  You can play each course in any season, at different times of day, or with different weather conditions.  Not only does each detail provide an additional feast for the eyes, but each affects the gameplay directly.Ah, the gameplay.  HSG3 uses a three-click and meter system to measure your swing:  hit the button once to start the meter, again to measure power, and once more for timing.  You can also used the d-pad to target your swing for slice purposes.  It's ridiculously easy to do, but can get very complex, as you'll have to pay attention to the slope of the course, the wind condition, which club would be best, and of course you'll have to avoid sand traps and water.  Putting is also easy: a grid appears over the green showing slope and speed, and you tap the button once to start the meter and again to measure power.  A randomly placed pin practically guarantees you won't play the same hole twice.  &quot;Easy to get into, difficult to master&quot; is a gaming cliche, but it fits HSG3 perfectly.There are several single-player modes to choose from, including Practice, Stroke, Tournament, and Vs.  You accumulate Hot Shots Points in these modes, which can then be used in the Shop to buy items ranging from new clubs and balls to caddies.  Trust me - you'll revisit the courses many times in order to rack up additional points.  You play against the CPU in Vs. mode, and if you win, you unlock additional characters with improved performance stats.  There's also an interesting internet mode, which ranks your best games against players nationwide.Multiplayer is a joy.  One of the best features is that you can use one controller for up to four people - no multitap needed!  You can play one hole or compare your scores over a series.  Fiendishly addictive, and it can get pretty competitive!!Hot Shots is golf for the anti-golfer.  Despite having a total lack of interest in the sport, I got into the game right away.  It takes the somewhat slow-paced and dry game of golf and makes it appealing and fun.  HSG3 is a game you and your friends will replay many times, whether to improve your scores, purchase all the items, bask in the beauty of the courses, or to have a simple good time.  Ignore the golf-ish exterior and give it a chance.  I think you'll get hooked, unless you're dead-set against having fun.

Here's my initial impressions of Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10 for the Wii with motion plus.....I have to say I had really high hopes for this years Tiger Woods game because of the M+, and it honestly has surpassed all of my expectations.This is is MUST BUY for all Wii Owners, and the version to purchase for all multi console owners.TW10 is without a doubt the best golf game I have ever played. M+ makes it very realistic & completely immersive.M+ perfectly reads what you are doing. Take putting for example. For the first time in a TW Wii game putting works just like real life. My first putt, I swung a bit harder than you would in "real life", and my ball shot across the green. It very accurately tracks whether you are taking a long or short putt. You can either look at the onscreen meter, or just swing like you would in real life. Follow through really matters too. The aiming with the M+ is perfect, the worst feature of last years Tiger is now perfectly executed. 2009 putting is still available (not like you would WANT to use it), but with motion plus, just select precision putting instead of standard and you will be amazed.The swing mechanic? Wow. Taking a shot feels, well....natural. M+ works so much better than any of the previous versions, the accuracy is almost scary. When driving, the harder you swing, the farther the ball goes. Hit at 50% power with a slight fade, that's what you get. Power swing with a draw?  You actually having to worry about both your backswing and power/follow through in a golf video game. And if you don't know how to do those things in real life, the tutorial is concise and explains the basics of it all in few short (2 minute) lessons.Motion+ makes the gameplay jump lightyears beyond any other golf game ever made. The gameplay certainly leaves the more visually stimulating versions(PS360PC) far behind.The weather on the course you are playing is based on real time weather at the actual course location, which TW checks from the Wii's weather channel.And the amount of content in this game boggles the mind. Most content packed Tiger Woods game ever.Included are almost every golf related activity you could imagine, this will keep you busy for a LONG time.Online Modes include:*Online play: both simultaneous play & real time tournaments, daily and weekly.Traditional Modes include:*Quick Play*PGA Tour*Fed-X Cup*Tournament Challenge (play against some of the toughest challenges in golf history)*Stroke Play*Match Play*Bloodsome*Greensome*Skins*Stableford*Alternate Shot*Best Ball*Four BallArcade Modes Include:*Disc Golf (available for ALL 27 courses)*Rings*Elimination Mode*One-Ball*Team One-Ball*Battle GolfMini Games*Mini Putt (Putt Putt)*Target*T-I-G-E-R*Capture the Flag*Target2TargetI have only tried the disc golf, but it really shows off the M+. I tried throwing it traditionally, straight up, straight down, backhand and I have to say it works very well. Lots of fun. Gets me excited for Wii Sports Resort!!2 other points of interest:There will be downloadable content in the future.If you are playing local multiplayer, you can play with a "Pass the Wii remote" mode until you get more M+ attachments.I highly recommend it to anybody looking for a good golf game. It's brilliant.The 27 included courses:New for 10:1. Banff Springs ( Stanley Thompson 18 )2. Bethpage ( Black )3. Hazeltine National C.C.4. Oakmont C.C.5. Pinehurst ( Course #2 )6. Torrey Pines G.C.

The first thing you'll notice is the complete graphics overhaul from 08 that completely immerses you a truly Hi-def golfing realm with the most detailed and beautiful courses you'll ever witness designed down to a "Tee" to their real-life counterparts. I was blown away by the 08 to 09 screen-shot comparison, needless to say 09 blows 08 out of the water hazard. And when I say overhaul, EA really went out of their way to make this a Golf Graphical masterpiece and that's not even touching upon Tiger's rep for uncanny ability to produce drug-like addictive game play that can only be subsided with therapy.As typical to recent Tiger tradition, this game uses the thumb-stick to simulate your swing; pull back and push forward as straight as you can to take a flawless swing.  The further and longer you pull back on your backswing, the higher percentage of power will be applied to your shot. If you pull or push slightly to the right or left with your thumb-stick motion, you will end up slicing or hooking your shot in varying degrees depending on how bad you shanked one. Last year's gameplay suffered because it was so finely tailored to your thumb-stick motion that you had to be insanely precise and accurate with your swing in order to have a decent day on the golf course often leaving your blood boiling in frustration. Holes-in-ones and chip-ins were a rare-breed. 09 relaxed a bit and is more forgiving with the thumb-stick swing and accuracy. What I really like this year is that it displays your thumb-stick motion with lines (one for backstroke & one for follow-through) on the ball icon at the bottom left to show you exactly what you are doing right or wrong which allows you to re-adjust if needed for your next shot. Brilliant. This same ball icon also shows you how much extra power you put on your swing (Tap A during you backswing to add power to your shot), the percentage power of your shot (how far you took your backswing) and the spin on your ball (Tap A while ball is flight and a direction).For the first time since Tiger's debut, you do not have to start from the bottom of the attributes barrel; no more starting at the beginner level and move your way up from scratch. Depending on how well you perform in the intro-training mode with Coach Haney will determine your initial skill level. If you played Tiger before (which I'm sure most of reading this have), your skill should be nowhere near the "Beginner" level. If you are Tiger vet like myself, you should start the game at somewhere in the "Pro" or "Master" level. If you are new to the game, don't panic as this game teaches everything you need to know with Tutorials with Coach Haney and, trust me, leaves plenty of room for improvement. What is also new, and you may dislike or like this feature, is the fact each attribute (four total) and your overall skill level can increase or decrease (*new) depending on how well you played the previous course. In previous versions, you could only improve upon attributes. This year, if you play crappy, expect your attributes, where you executed poorly, to go down. Further to boot, Coach evaluates your performance at end of a course or play and gives you the appropriate attribute training sessions on areas where he feels you need improvement. Choose to train or not, it's up to you -- Coach is just trying to further improve your game. This new skill concept certainly draws this game closer to real golf (even Tiger has bad days) and makes for almost an endless challenge.The four attribute levels, compressed from previous versions, are: Power, Accuracy, Short Game and Putting. Also, you will have an Average Skill (an average of all four attribute skill levels) rated zero to ten (0-10). If you are smashing drives straight, look for your power and accuracy to increase. If you're shanking drives into the woods, look to botch your power and accuracy skill.Also for the first time (I love new features), you can tune your clubs. Not happy with your accuracy, increase the sweet spot of the club ultimately giving you more control but sacrificing power or vice versa. You can also tweak loft, spin, fade and draw. Tune club mode puts you on a driving range, allowing you to tune the club in question and then immediately test it out on the range. Too much draw, no problema -- tweak it until that baby is hitting straight. Do you need to counteract your slice with a slight draw - here's the spot to do it. More power less control, yup. Do you want more loft on your short game irons to place the ball dead accurate near the cup, you got it -- tweak and tune your clubs to match your style.Character creation and customization:  One of Tiger's strong suits lie with player progression and customization.  Nothing new, with tiger this year as last, you have an infinite number of options to create a character so that your avatar in the game almost identically matches your real life counterpart right down to the mole on your forehead.  You can use the infamous Gamernet to upload your picture and  face-capture your mug in a 3D rendering onto the game.  Further customize your mug and player by inputting style of hair, clothes, height, weight etc.  Game play, depending on how you play, will give you credits towards accessories, clubs and clothes to purchase to further develop your character .Commentary: With a new face comes a new voice, 09 has changed a long tradition by switching commentators.  The hilarious mockumentary and savviness  offered by McCord and Faherty are out and will certainly be missed.  Their refreshing, witty dry humor made you laugh and shone light even if you were having a bad day on the course.  I won't deduct too many points though because it seems those guys were around Tiger for a long time and hearing different voices, at least at first, is refreshing but obviously not as humorous.  Kelly Tillman and Sam Torrance are up to bat now and although uber-savvy in the world of golf lack in adding any new depth, excitement and humor.  All is not lost, they offer great commentary, history, advice and still let you know when you are awful."New Courses and Golfers-Test your skills on new courses, including Gary Player Country Club in South Africa, Wentworth Country Club in England, and more, while international stars Se Ri Pak, Darren Clarke, and others join the competition." Amazon.com. Yes Yes and Yes!Update:  After Coach Haney's initial evaluation (one for every attribute: Driving, Accuracy, Short Game and Putting), he will give you an initial rating with a maximum rating of 4 (out of 10).  No, you won't be able to be a perfect 10 at the start the game regardless of how well you perform in training.  After all, what fun would that be.  It leaves room to truly master your game.  Play a round in a tournament or take on the Tiger Challenge to increase your attributes.  If you've played Tiger before, it won't be long before you reach an average skill of 8 or 9.  If you are close to 10, you've mastered and had a flawless streak.  The challenge is to be within a certain distance on consistent basis.  Even if you are scoring low, if you're not target, your rating will indeed suffer.  If your game needs some work, you'll be a 7 and if are a rookie to the series, you be at the 6 or below.  The great thing about Tiger, whether new to it or not, it gives plenty of opportunities to improve and more importantly makes you keep coming back for more.Tiger Challenge has been overhauled and its welcomed change.  Instead of a going through a Dynamic Challenge Tree where you select which direction to go in, this time you have to earn enough points to face the boss (PGA Star) of that stage.  Each stage as 8+ challenges that you can play to earn points to face the boss.  Once the boss of that stage is beaten, you move onto the next level until you ultimately reach Tiger Woods himself.  This makes it more linear than the previous versions but it still fun and challenging nonetheless.  If anything, Tiger Challenge is a fast way to earn cash to purchase new clothes and equipment.
This game is Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2005 by EA Sports. It has many different options. It is much better then the other golf game i had Tiger Wooda PGA Tour 2002 (see my review). When you enter the main menu you have to pass three parts of a tutorial. Then you can start playing. You know how you could take advantage in early games and spin the ball directly to the hole? Well, early in the game, you go through tour difficulty and can't spin the ball any more. Gameface is back and better than ever. Golfers include Adam Scott, Tiger Woods, Sunday Tiger Woods, Ricky Barnes, Natlie Gulbis , # 1 golfer in the world Vijay singh, and Stuart Appleby. Courses include Couer D' Alene, Coloniel CC (the course where Annoka Sourenstam missed the cut at in a PGA Tour event), Pebble Beach, St. Andrews, and TPC at Sawgrass. Announcing includes Gary McCord. Also in this game are l;egens such as Arnold Palmer, Seve Balleseros, Gary Player, and Ben Hogan. This game is rated E for everyone. My favorite mode is matchplay, when you win a hole you can take away any of your opponent's clubs (except for the putter) or bring back one of your clubs that was taken away from you. Aother modes are stableford scoring system tournament, better ball  alternate shot, and four somes. Four problems though. There is no Phil Mickelson. No Ernie Els. No Whistling Straits (home of the 2004 U.S open). Finally, no president's cup. There is new Tiger Vision which during a round of golf when you reach the green, you get three looks at putts no matter where they are. This means you are garenteed to make the putt. Have fun and enjoy gaming.
