This is one of the best car games out right now for the xbox.  It beats out test drive by alot, and wreckless it beats out because its a tad bit easier. Any way, the graphics are stellar in this game, the gameplay is awesome and challanging, sometimes frustrating but not as bad as wreckless and test drive. The Sound in this game is the most realistic sounds yet for any game.  If your into car games, and you have and xbox, and you lov GTA1,2,or 3 this is your game to play.  Its a good buy and a good rental if you can't afford it.  So until any new car games come out, this is the best.So hears my retingsGameplay-9.0Graphics-9.5Controls-9.0Sound-8.5Replay Value-9.5((El DiAbLo))

It beats the other controllers that I have tried. Logitech just doesn't do it for me. It is on the little expensive side.
Bought this for my pc, a tad over priced, but works great.

I like the color and it beats my old controller. Nothing wrong with it at all so I have no complaints
Grandson Loves it
We bought Diablo and found ourselves needing another controller as we wanted to play co-op. I ordered this and it was exactly what it was suppose to be.

Halo 2 is definetely my favorite game for the Xbox system currently. With amazing graphics, gameplay, sound, many weapons, vehicles and the best online play to ever hit the Xbox so far, halo 2 is is the most playable game ever created.Halo 2 has a basic story, its just that Master Chief has returned and is once again trying to stop the covenant from taking over earth and all of the other planets. Master Chief is also trying to deny a weapon of massive power and one that would have a great effect on the world!Even though this game has a simple story, the gameplay is unthinkable. I will break up my review into different categories listed below...Graphics: One of the best parts of Halo 2 is definetely the graphics. The background detail is superb, the texture is smooth and clear. The water is also very well done compared to halo 1, but still not as good as some games have done. The cutscenes are worth bragging about, for example, when i was watching a halo 2 cutscene and my cousin came into the room he told me to "change the channel," as he obviousely thought i was watching television which i thought was kind of funny. The animations of your character reloading, moving and shooting are truely amazing as well, (you switch off from being the covenant and master chief throughout campaign) as it seems like a real movie like a previousely mentioned. Master Chief looks much cooler then he did in Halo 1, as he has a redesigned suit and many more guns with much better graphics. Although it seems like i am saying that the graphics are amazing, i do think that they could have done just a tiny bit of a better job on them just so that it could be one of the best games in terms of graphics to every hit the Xbox Console, that would be great! But all in all, the graphics are wonderful, and definetely not an aspect of the game to complain about, unless you are picky, wait, lemme refrase that, too picky!Gameplay: There is one word, and only one word to describe the gameplay in this game. Fun! Thats it, this is arguably the best game on the xbox console, and there are many reasons to support that.First of all, you are able to sprint at twice the speed that you could in Halo 1. For those of you who play Halo 2 you probobly do not see a difference really in the sprinting aspect. I didn't either when i first played the game, but after i played a lot of halo 2, and then played halo 1, you could definetely see the difference between the two in terms of the speed that you can sprint, which is much better then the first.You are also able to highjack vehicles which gives the game a little "grand theft auto" them to it which is very fun to do. When your playing on Xbox Live, you get a medal each time you highjack a vehicle. (You get medals for each bonus thing you do such as highjacking, sniping, assasinating, etc.) Of course you could not do this in the previous halo 1 game so thats another difference between the two.Another better thing in this game then there was before in the previous one is that the A.I is much smarter. For example, they can sometimes form a "short time alliance" with another enemy and they can swarm at you, or the grunts can hide behind corners and wait for you to come. The elites are also much better at dodging your shots which makes it much harder to hit them. Also, if you want your allies to drive a vehicle they can which you couldn't do in the first halo game. The only problem is that sometimes they don't show that they're smart by slamming into walls and you have to switch seats repetitively before they'll get there "nack" back.But as a result of my gameplay review, it has changed a lot over the long and painful time that it took for the sequel to come out.New Weapons: There are many new weapons in halo to and i will list them underneath. They include...(Keep in mind that the ratings are intirely my opinion)BR55 Battle Rifle: 2x scope, burst shots, all in all its an ok weapon, not the best. Long range: 6/10, Medium range: 6/10, Close range: 6/10Covenant Carbine: Basically the Covenant form of the Battle Rifle except that its not burst, its just a one shot fire. Pretty good though, as it can fire much faster then the battle rifle. Long range: 7/10, Medium range: 8/10, Close range: 8/10Particle Beam Rifle: Covenant form of Sniper rifle, except that if you shoot two shots in a row it has to charge back up which takes a couple seconds, but i think its better then the sniper rifle seeing that if you have a good aim, you can finish your enemy off quickly! (Or ally, ha ha!) Long range: 10/10, Medium range: 8/10, Close range: 6/10. The reason why the ratings decrease is because the closer you are to your enemy, the harder it becomes to shoot considering that your aimer is unbearably small, so its hard to aim, even from a far distance, but it doesn't take that much skill to be able to snipe people from afar.Brute Shot: In my opinion i hate this weapon. Only the brutes use it (in single player) and they can never kill me with it because it sucks. Its almost impossible to aim at anything moving from afar or even medium range. The only good thing is that the shots can bounce of walls, wooooopy! Long range: 1/10, Medium range: 3/10, Close range: 5/10Covenant Energy Sword: Probobly the best weapon for close range is the sword. Even from medium range you can lock on to your target and unleash a super upercut attack which is a one hit kill unless your openent uses a cheap overshield, which i personally think they should take out of the game, seeing that whoever has the overshield cannot be stopped by one person unless the openent has a sword or a rocket launcher. Long range: 0/10, Medium range: 8/10, Close range: 10/10Fuel Rod Gun: Ahhhh, i wish this gun was in multiplayer but i guess it would be way to cheap, considering the amount of ammo it has and that it is a one hit kill. But for single player it works mighty fine! Long range: 10/10, Medium range: 10/10, Close range: 10/10Two other things i have to add is that you can dual weild certain weapons, but the only problem with this is that you cannot chuck grenades when you are dual weilding which kind of makes sense when you think about it. Also, the rocket launchers can lock on to vehicles which makes it much easier to destroy those cheap @$$ vehicle lovers!Vehicles: I will now mention the new vehicles in Halo 2. They are...M12G1 Warthog LAAV- Basically the same as the previous Warthog, except it uses a Gauss Cannon which is a one hit kill instead of the machine gun. (The previous Warthog is in Halo 2 as well.)9/10Specter: Sort of like the Wraith, (Wraiths can be used in multiplayer now) except its faster and can hold three people, one for the plasma cannot turret at the back, one in the side seat, and one obviousely driving the vehicle. 9/10Shadow: The vehicle that the covenant use, can hold up to 8 combatents depending on the species of convenant, an ok vehicle when your using it. It uses a plasma cannon like the rest of the other covenant vehicles. 7/10Two more things i have to add about the vehicles are that the Banshee can now be used in multiplayer as well as the Wraith which makes multipayer much more fun.Sound: A great game needs great audio right? Well halo 2 listened. From the classic halo chant, to the rather heavy halo 2 beat, comes wonderful sound and definetely good enough quality that you can just sit their drinking tea/coffee and listening to it. Well, i guess if your that obsessed with the audio, you can just by the soundrack right?Online: Now comes the best part. The online multiplayer play. I have to say, i though crimson skies had the best online multiplayer play, but as soon as this hit came out i quickly regreted myself saying that. Basically, there are ranked games and unranked games, (unranked games are known as training games.) As you win ranked games you gain levels, you start out at level 1 and the last level is level 50, but i believe that the highest level right now is 27, so as you can see its extremely hard to work your way up once you get past level 20.The different ranked games are as follows...Rumble Pit: Up to 8 players all dualing it out against each other. Thit matchmake playlist can include normal slayer, all rockets, all swords, all shotguns, odball, or king of the hill. This is probobly my favorite kind of playlist to play.Team Skirmish: Up to 8 players, 4 on 4, on a team obviousely. This playlist usually includes the different types of Capture the Flag, team odball, 3 plots or assault. Pretty fun playlist to play!Team Slayer: 8 players, 4 on 4 against each other can include normal team slayer, team rockets, team swords, Fiesta Team slayer, team shotguns or team phantoms. Probobly runner up for my favorite playist to play halo 2 on.Head to Head: Simple straight up slayer games 1 v 1 can inlcude normal slayer, all swords or all rifles. Very fun, and addicting especially when your winning.Big team battle: Huge game, up to 16 players, 8 v 8 can include team slayer, different types of CTF, Assault, or land grab where you have to take over different areas of land. Very fun playlist as it sounds like, but can get very hard and boring considering that your dying a whole tun, especially when your playing on a smaller map.Clan Battles: Basically, you can join a clan which in different words is like a club and you get your clan together and battle with them in different match types. Pretty fun, good for bragging rights. When your clan starts winning, it will level up.In conclusion to my online review and whole halo 2 review, the online aspect is probobly the best part of this entire game. Its so much fun trash talking to your opponents and so addicting to play ranked games. You can also just play custom games where you can invite all your friends to play whatever type/map you want. You can also customize ever thinkable option which makes this game truely worth your time and money.Halo 2 delivers excellent gameplayer/graphics/sound/online play which definetely makes the game a worthy $50. Halo 2 is definetely not one of those games that you are going to end up returning straight away after you get it, you'll be twice as addicted to it as you were to Halo 1! (Unless you don't have Xbox, and if you don't like halo, no offence, but theres something wrong with you.)COLLECTORS EDITION:With collectors edition, you get a ton of new features which includes a cooler looking game case, a "behind the scenes" footage of halo 2 and how this amazing game was made. It also includes Visualizing the story (Concept Art, Early Level Design From Script to Game, Narrated Storyboards and Character Tests. Also, the collectors edition includes bonus materials which has features such as trailers from halo 1 and 2, Cut scenes, commentaries, Inside Bungie, A bungie history, before halo, the making of halo 1 and Gameographies.GET THE COLLECTORS EDITION, IT IS WORTH YOUR MONEY!

What can I say this game is just plainly awesome, and anything I could say wouldn't even describe the feeling of playing this game. If you loved Halo and FPS games you'll love this. Halo 2 takes place after the events on Halo.CAMPAIGN MODE:Campaign mode is really fun, with an awesome story; with all kinds of twists and turns. The campaign modes reveal new charters like the Prophets; leaders of the Covenant, as well as the Brutes, which is more of an enforcer that relies on Agression, and Buggers which are incests that use their speed and agility, and mass in numbers to try in their attacks. Also you you will encounter the Honor guard, which are Elites with tricked out body armor, and they have also given the Jackals a new look. Their are loads of new weapons and toys to play around with:Weapons-CampaignLike the new /Covenant Beam Rifile/- Which is the Covenant sniper Rifle mostly used by Jackals, super effective against every thing instant kill with head shot.You also have the new/ Battle Rifile/- Which is a new good looking rifile with a zoom that can fire three round burst at a time, whihc is very effective mid-close range combat.You also can now wield the/ Covenant Energy Sword/- Which is one heck of a weapon for people who like combat close and personal. Great for stealth I must say with two differet attacks basic mele and critical strike.I also loved the new/ Covenant Carbine/- Which is a very effective plasma semi automatic rifle which is ver effective on mid to long range targets, ggreat toy, more of a fall back weapon though like the Battle Rifile.They also have an new/ Sentile Beam/- Whihc is a weapon you will encounter latter in the game great against fllod along with the shotgun, and Plasma Sword. Shoots out beam similar to the flying sentlies you encounter.You also have a new gernade launcher called the/- Brute Shot/- which can shoot out gernades at a rapid speed. Good for shelling a group of enemies. You can deflect the gernades off walls to hit targets to, a sweet trick that you can use in latter levels of the game.In the game they have created the brand new, DUAL WIELD system, which makes it possible to wield two weapons at a time in different effictive combos, which opens the doors to all new possibiltes.Weapons/Dual Wield-Campaign/SMG/-A new sub machine gun that is very effective, especially when dual wield in different combos, an ideal weapon for close quaters combat. Probably the best weapon choice for efficient killing./Brute Plasma Rifle/-Just like the original, except it's red and called the Brute plama rifle no difference, except for Butes only use it.Just as great as the original./Magnum/- I really didn't like how they took the zoom, off the pistol, but it can be used in alot of effective combos like the the famous SMG and Magnum combo.So you can basically throughout the game use combos with all the weapons for example:Plasma Rifle and NeedlerSMG and Pistol(Magnum)Needler and SMGBrute Plasma Rifile and Plasma RifleSMG and SMGNeedler and NeedlerB.Plasma Rifle and NeedlerPlasma Rifle and Plasma RiflePlasma Pistol and Plasma RifleGraphis/New Changes:... well you get the point the new dual wield system really adds something to the combat. Oh, yeah The Rocket Launcher is now more of an heat seeker, than randomly firing at stuff, way more effective, and they have gave the game a whole new look with graphics ten times better than the original.They have also added destroyable environments like vechile damage, and such. A way better physics engine as well. To be honest the graphics are the best I've see to date.In campaign mode you also have new vechiles like:Other Toys-Campaign:/The Scarb/: Kind of like one of those Imperial Walkers from "Star Wars", That the Covenant has,  very powerful with a powerful laser blast./The Wraith/: A new Covenant motar tank, that is a pretty sweet toy to play with, but is not as effective as the scorpion tank, but does have a speed boost, which the also added to the Ghosts/The Spectre/: The Covenant version of a Warhog, can fit up to 3 passengers along with a driver and gunner fun, in multiplayer action, you don't use it as much in the campaign./The Guass Warhog/: A new vesion of the warhog with mor or a plasma type particle canon einstead of the basic machine gun. great new toy, but best used in multi player./Shadow/: A basic covenant troop transport vechile featured in the game can carry multible passanger as well as cargo, such as a ghost.Instead of drop ships that the original game had, Halo 2 features/Phantoms/ which are kind of like the covenant version of the Pillar of Autumn, used for dropping off troops and supplies at tatical points as well as good for doing som serios carnage.Campaign Overview:As you can see they have added a lot in the the game. Campaign Mode has 15 level, with brilliant landscapes, and unbelivable graphics, with a twist. You play as the Master Chief for part of the game, but you will also play part of the game as a Covenat elite called the Arbiter, this will give you more of the Covenant's side of he story. The game has a lot more depth than the original, and is way more advanced as well!!! Overall Campaign mode is fairly easy until you try Heroic, but will keep you busy for about 15 hours.Some people didn't like the ciff hanger ending so they said the game was rushed, how naive can some people be, the end just leads into Halo 3 which will be coming out with the new Xbox 360. I honestly wanted more after the end of the game, but really I don't like people who try to find something wrong with the game and make such a big deal about it. Halo 2 is a materpiece no doubt about it. The game is what all sci fi movies should be like. Hey I even heard they are coming out with a Halo movie, so watch out in the future.Multi- PlayerYes, Campaign mode is fun, but thee multi player fun is what really makes this game shine, whether it's from split screen action, to co op adventure, or playing against the world on Xbox Live whihc is darn fun. I got new for you the multi player will have you playing this game for hours for example.For example after school one day after I fininshed my homework, at 5:00 PM I started to have some fun playing on Xbox live, so I played and played, so when When I looked at the clock it was 2:00 AM, The game was so fun I played for another hour than I decide to go to bed. So, ipractilly become addicted to it. Lan parties are nice too link up with 15 other people and have some a good time and show your fiends what true marksmanship is all about.Halo 2 has a whole bunch of new maps, that ae very detailed and are so darn fun, with all the new weapons and such. The possiblites are endless. You can form your own tournments and so on and so forth. Multi player is what makes this game really fun. It's just darn addictive. You can eve customize your profile, which makes the game really cool.WHAT MAKES THE SPECIAL EDITION SO SPECIAL:If you are asking if you should go out and spend your money on the special edition, I say yeah go ahead. You get a second disc with "The Making of Halo 2" along with some great reading meterial from the Covenant's point of view, along with the cool silver case. Look, it is only a few bucks more so I say get your money's worth.Well, you don't have too,... if you don't want too and you want to save about a few bucks, but on Amazon. com they have it on sale anyway for about $40.00, at the current moment, so I really suggest you if you're an amazon shopper and you did not buy this game go ahead to. Either way it's still the same game special edition or not.OVERALL:Overall, this is the best game of 2004-2005 in my opinion. Great game, a must buy for an FPS fan, great sequel to Halo. This game gets a 5/5.... outstanding game, bring on part 3!!!-Rogue Fox"Rogue"

The campaign modes reveal new charters like the Prophets; leaders of the Covenant, as well as the Brutes, which is more of an enforcer that relies on Agression, and Buggers which are incests that use their speed and agility, and mass in numbers to try in their attacks. Also you you will encounter the Honor guard, which are Elites with tricked out body armor, and they have also given the Jackals a new look. Their are loads of new weapons and toys to play around with:Weapons-CampaignLike the new /Covenant Beam Rifile/- Which is the Covenant sniper Rifle mostly used by Jackals, super effective against every thing instant kill with head shot.You also have the new/ Battle Rifile/- Which is a new good looking rifile with a zoom that can fire three round burst at a time, whihc is very effective mid-close range combat.You also can now wield the/ Covenant Energy Sword/- Which is one heck of a weapon for people who like combat close and personal. Great for stealth I must say with two differet attacks basic mele and critical strike.I also loved the new/ Covenant Carbine/- Which is a very effective plasma semi automatic rifle which is ver effective on mid to long range targets, ggreat toy, more of a fall back weapon though like the Battle Rifile.They also have an new/ Sentile Beam/- Whihc is a weapon you will encounter latter in the game great against fllod along with the shotgun, and Plasma Sword. Shoots out beam similar to the flying sentlies you encounter.You also have a new gernade launcher called the/- Brute Shot/- which can shoot out gernades at a rapid speed. Good for shelling a group of enemies. You can deflect the gernades off walls to hit targets to, a sweet trick that you can use in latter levels of the game.In the game they have created the brand new, DUAL WIELD system, which makes it possible to wield two weapons at a time in different effictive combos, which opens the doors to all new possibiltes.Weapons/Dual Wield-Campaign/SMG/-A new sub machine gun that is very effective, especially when dual wield in different combos, an ideal weapon for close quaters combat. Probably the best weapon choice for efficient killing./Brute Plasma Rifle/-Just like the original, except it's red and called the Brute plama rifle no difference, except for Butes only use it.Just as great as the original./Magnum/- I really didn't like how they took the zoom, off the pistol, but it can be used in alot of effective combos like the the famous SMG and Magnum combo.So you can basically throughout the game use combos with all the weapons for example:Plasma Rifle and NeedlerSMG and Pistol(Magnum)Needler and SMGBrute Plasma Rifile and Plasma RifleSMG and SMGNeedler and NeedlerB.Plasma Rifle and NeedlerPlasma Rifle and Plasma RiflePlasma Pistol and Plasma RifleGraphis/New Changes:... well you get the point the new dual wield system really adds something to the combat. Oh, yeah The Rocket Launcher is now more of an heat seeker, than randomly firing at stuff, way more effective, and they have gave the game a whole new look with graphics ten times better than the original.They have also added destroyable environments like vechile damage, and such. A way better physics engine as well. To be honest the graphics are the best I've see to date.In campaign mode you also have new vechiles like:Other Toys-Campaign:/The Scarb/: Kind of like one of those Imperial Walkers from "Star Wars", That the Covenant has,  very powerful with a powerful laser blast./The Wraith/: A new Covenant motar tank, that is a pretty sweet toy to play with, but is not as effective as the scorpion tank, but does have a speed boost, which the also added to the Ghosts/The Spectre/: The Covenant version of a Warhog, can fit up to 3 passengers along with a driver and gunner fun, in multiplayer action, you don't use it as much in the campaign./The Guass Warhog/: A new vesion of the warhog with mor or a plasma type particle canon einstead of the basic machine gun. great new toy, but best used in multi player./Shadow/: A basic covenant troop transport vechile featured in the game can carry multible passanger as well as cargo, such as a ghost.Instead of drop ships that the original game had, Halo 2 features/Phantoms/ which are kind of like the covenant version of the Pillar of Autumn, used for dropping off troops and supplies at tatical points as well as good for doing som serios carnage.Campaign Overview:As you can see they have added a lot in the the game. Campaign Mode has 15 level, with brilliant landscapes, and unbelivable graphics, with a twist. You play as the Master Chief for part of the game, but you will also play part of the game as a Covenat elite called the Arbiter, this will give you more of the Covenant's side of he story. The game has a lot more depth than the original, and is way more advanced as well!!! Overall Campaign mode is fairly easy until you try Heroic, but will keep you busy for about 15 hours.Some people didn't like the ciff hanger ending so they said the game was rushed, how naive can some people be, the end just leads into Halo 3 which will be coming out with the new Xbox 360. I honestly wanted more after the end of the game, but really I don't like people who try to find something wrong with the game and make such a big deal about it. Halo 2 is a materpiece no doubt about it. The game is what all sci fi movies should be like. Hey I even heard they are coming out with a Halo movie, so watch out in the future.Multi- PlayerYes, Campaign mode is fun, but thee multi player fun is what really makes this game shine, whether it's from split screen action, to co op adventure, or playing against the world on Xbox Live whihc is darn fun. I got new for you the multi player will have you playing this game for hours for example.For example after school one day after I fininshed my homework, at 5:00 PM I started to have some fun playing on Xbox live, so I played and played, so when When I looked at the clock it was 2:00 AM, The game was so fun I played for another hour than I decide to go to bed. So, ipractilly become addicted to it. Lan parties are nice too link up with 15 other people and have some a good time and show your fiends what true marksmanship is all about.Halo 2 has a whole bunch of new maps, that ae very detailed and are so darn fun, with all the new weapons and such. The possiblites are endless. You can form your own tournments and so on and so forth. Multi player is what makes this game really fun. It's just darn addictive. You can eve customize your profile, which makes the game really cool.WHAT MAKES THE SPECIAL EDITION SO SPECIAL:If you are asking if you should go out and spend your money on the special edition, I say yeah go ahead. You get a second disc with "The Making of Halo 2" along with some great reading meterial from the Covenant's point of view, along with the cool silver case. Look, it is only a few bucks more so I say get your money's worth.Well, you don't have too,... if you don't want too and you want to save about a few bucks, but on Amazon. com they have it on sale anyway for about $40.00, at the current moment, so I really suggest you if you're an amazon shopper and you did not buy this game go ahead to. Either way it's still the same game special edition or not.OVERALL:Overall, this is the best game of 2004-2005 in my opinion. Great game, a must buy for an FPS fan, great sequel to Halo. This game gets a 5/5.... outstanding game, bring on part 3!!!-Rogue Fox"Rogue"
Tiring days of 'wouldn't it be great to have a game that combines the realism, tuning, gameplay and massive car selection of Gran Turismo with all the aftermarket parts, body kits, decal customizations, and mods of Need for Speed Underground' have finally seen a dawn of new morning.  A new day that will not settle quickly like many of the other overdone street, arcade, and simulated racers on the market.  Setting this game apart is a simple concept yet ungrasped by all in it's genre.  One that should have been taken care of with the 3rd or 4th series of Gran Turismo.  Reasons for glory:1) Well over 200 cars to choose from.  Plus X amount of downloadable cars.2) Manufacturers from all over the spectrum, all over the globe have made themselves available in Forza Motorsport. BMW, Volkswagen, Porsche, Chevy, Ford, Toyota, Honda, Acura, Subaru, Mitsubishi, Ferrari, Ashton martin, Bentley, Mazda, Chrysler, Pontiac,  and Lancia to only name a few.3) Upgrades.  Upgrades.  Upgrades.  Throw in 3 or more levels of upgrades of aftermarket parts from performance tweaking: engine tuning, turbos, superchargers, air intakes, exhaust, cambers shmambers, brakes, cam shafts, throws, suspension, intercoolers, rims, and tires etc.. to body kits: hoods, hood scoops, front bumpers, side skirts, rear bumpers, spoilers, and window tint to skin visuals: custom paint jobs and an endless array of decals to slap on.  One hundred layers of decals can be applied to each section (top; roof, hood trunk, sides, and bumpers) of the car.  Many shapes, designs, and aftermarket logos can be re-sized, colorized, tilted, or spun to give your mod car endless potential.4) The gameplay of Forza is a cross between "Gran Turismo" and "RalliSport"., leaning more towards the "RalliSport" side of the house,  which translates to head-pinning ultra driving realism.  Don't like the car's handling? Upgrade the suspension, brakes, or tires or tweak them using the tuning mode.  Each and every car handles, drives and sounds the way it should.  This game offers solid control and a realistic simulated driving experience.  Difficulty level can be set to many different degrees of variation to tweak the game for a challenge that fits each individual.  Harder difficulties will award the driver more credits after each victory.  One does not have to be in first place to earn credits.  All places except for last will be rewarded credits.  Ofcourse, the higher place finishes will earn you more credits.  Credits will be subtracted from the total earned for damage penalties.  Yes, I said "Damage penalties".  Days of ramming into walls and other cars at maximum speeds with no worries of damage or hindered performance have been washed out with the tide.  This game offers one of the most realistic programmed damage engines I've seen to date.  Not only do you see damage done to your car but the damage done is different each time depending on where you are hit and how hard.  Ie Bumpers hanging off, dents, scrapes, dirt, mud, smashed tail lights, broken windows, hoods on the verge of falling off, doors smashed in, side mirrors broken off etc.. I have even seen spoilers fly off of cars in this game from the impact of rear collisions.  These types of collisions can be fun to watch to say the least, especially if you are the car who charged from behind.  Not so fun if you are driving the car that took damage.  Damage done to your car will also hinder it's performance.  Ie the car pulls to the right or left or there will be a decrease in acceleration and speed. A diagram will also flash showing where on the car that body and internal damage has been taken.  This includes wheel well, tires, steering, and surface damage.5) Events of all types will keep this game's tires burning pavement.  Events that are offered are based on Class, Horsepower, Region, AWD, RWD, FWD, Weight, Rivals such as the EVO Vs. STI, Car type, Special events, and events that become unlocked as you reach certain levels.  Your car must meet the specifications of that race to enter.  For instance, the "American Muscle" events only include cars that were made prior to 1975, obviously made in America and must have over X amount of HP and torque such as the Camaro SS, Corvette Stingray, and Dodge Challenger.  These type of events add a whole lot to the game in that it gives you an excuse to take out "Classic" cars or other specialty cars that you would normally not use in a regular event.  I've seen other games make classic cars like this unlockable, however you never get to use them because they serve no purpose for the upcoming events.  But not in Forza.  Win or buy a MUSCLE CAR and you'll have plenty of reasons to use it, which just adds to the excitement.  Like the Corvette Stingray for example, this is a great car to use in a muscle car drag event or when racing other muscle cars but cannot handle sport compact events at tracks with a lot of bends. In Forza, you can just take out the Stingray and match it with other cars of that category and genre, where it belongs.  More tracks become available as your LEVEL increases.  LEVELS increase as more credits are earned.  Credits are earned after each event.  These credits can be used to buy cars or upgrades.  After winning an entire event (an event consist of multiple races), you win a car that relates to that type of event.  Thus the stamina of replay value for this game remains strong.  In other words, addicting to the point of life consumption.6) The graphics in this game will blow your mind's transmission.  The car models in this game are nearly flawless.  You literally have to plant your face next to or on the TV to notice any pixelation.  The reflective skin of each freshly painted car render perfectly.  Microsoft is more of a master of landscapes than they are of architecture and it shows.  Their rendered "landscape" environments are refreshing and beautiful.  The rolling hills, mountains, trees, and area surfaces are some of the best I've seen.  The landscapes in FORZA come off more realistic than say "Need for Speed Underground II".  Although NFSU2 is beautifully rendered, it feels more "plastic" than real.  Which is not necessarily a "bad thing" considering it is a video game after all.  The cityscapes and buildings in FORZA are not as perfect in that they seem too organic and soft as if something out of a dream.  Can you say overdone anti-alias.  This doesn't affect it's score too much as you will be flying past them and thus the whole soft anti-alias thing will at times seem applicable.  Don't get me wrong, they are well done.  Just not up to par with Need for Speed Underground II and Gran Turismo.  Riding through New York City was dead-on with actuality in placement.  Each block, street, building, billboard were depicted almost seamless to what you would see if for some reason Time Square was actually blocked off for you to ride through it.  I think I even saw Robert Deniro trying to catch a cab.  This nearly dead-on placement accuracy is the case with most cities, areas, and actual race tracks in the game.  And you will be more than satisfied with the diversity and amount of tracks there are to choose from.To be continued..Buy this game now!!
THE SHORT: A fine mix of real-time planning and action. The scenarios feel like you're actually participating in battles from Braveheart or Lord of the Rings, but less complicated and more hands-on than typical strategy games. Like Dynasty Warriors with on-the-field planning rather than something like "Risk", there's no turn-by-turn stuff. Very good graphics and sound round out a solid but sometimes frustrating package.THE LONG: Don't misunderstand when I say there is strategy to this game. Unlike Final Fantasy Tactics or the Civilization series, this game is much more hands-on, with real-time battle decisions rather than micromanaging in a turn-based environment. This is not in the least a turn-based strategy game.Rather, KUF puts you in control of a character who, on each large 3d map, goes where you want him to, when you want him to, with his troops visibly around him. As you roam around through forests, meadows, and plains, you'll see the enemy and engage them. Do you stop moving and tell your archers to launch their fire arrows, or do you rush flying into their troops and enjoy some hack `n slash?I'll give you an example from one of the levels. You guide your character and his troops (again, in real time- you use a targeting reticle to tell your guys where to go on an over-the-shoulder-view 3d landscape, and they start running). But you stop your troops once you see the enemy in the distance. You send out one of your troops to scout out the area, and he runs along the enemy's lines giving you an idea how many there are. They also have their backs to the sun, so you'll be blinded- you have to move around the side through the forest. Then, when your ally engages the enemy and sends his signal, you come raging out of the forest to flank the enemy. As your troops run, screaming with weapons held aloft, the game immediately segues into combat mode and you find yourself slashing away at the troops with thrusts and combos like a medieval Dynasty Warriors. This is all done in real time, with no turn taking- if you get too close to the enemy on your approach, they'll see you trying to sneak and will just come at you full force before you have time to know where to run.That's the style of this game: interactive battles that, minus the positioning device that you move with and the window you give troop commands in, take place in fully immersive 3d real-time. And by the time you're 4 to 5 battles in, things get pretty complicated. Instead of just sneaking around the army, you'll find yourself setting traps in the ground as you lie around the side of a cliff in ambush. Then you draw the enemy out by riding through their ranks with your men on horseback. Finally you rush them with your entire army as they approach and are struck by the traps.Though this game is entirely focused on the battles, it's fleshed out between. Each battle means something as your religious-minded characters slowly try to take back strategic locations on their quest to reclaim holy ground from the monster invaders. In between these campaigns is when you outfit yourself in towns and castles. This is where the game most closely resembles a strategy title- you'll go to a menu and pick places to go, such as the pub where you recruit mercenaries or the armory where you decide which items to buy for the gold you earn in battle. Do you buy your main character a better weapon, outfit your troops with better armor, or try for special items such as those which raise your resistance to fire? Finally, for the more strategic fan, your troops can all be upgraded. In a simplified version of Final Fantasy 10's grid system, you see a layout of possible types your troops can become (knights, bombardiers, etc) and can see what is needed to get them there (such as using experience points to raise a certain skill). It's not very hard to get your troops to advance, it's just hard to know how best to spend your experience points since like your gold it is used for the main character as well.But again, minus these 10-minute intermissions, the game is all about battle. It's balanced so that you can't just rush and attack every troop head on or you'll die soon. But then it's not so strategic that you're sitting on a map screen, dictating which units will go where. You don't have to be a heavy planner, but it's more than just a button-masher for sure.The graphics are pretty, though the characters' mouths don't move during cinemas. The acting is variable as well, though the main character thankfully comes off as perfectly fine. The sounds are very well done- when you command fire arrows, you'll hear your archers give the command, stand in a line and get their arrows lit by the torch wielder, then hear "loose!" as they pull skyward and fire. It's very thorough and realistic, and is the impetus behind the comparisons to similar scenes in the movies. It's a satisfying feeling of more genuine "on the battlefield" fighting than I get out of Dynasty Warriors (a series I still enjoy).However, the game can get very difficult. Halfway through the initial character's campaign, battles become a lot more complicated. In one stage in particular you roam through a forest thickly populated by creatures, and the best strategy is to draw the armies out one by one and dispose of them until you can approach hiding places closer and closer to the goal. It isn't actually any "harder" to do than earlier levels- you just have to become more disciplined and patient as you wait, like a real tactician, for slower strategies to pay off and let you tread safely through the outnumbering foes. It's satisfying as hell when you win, but pretty frustrating when you lose, especially after a half hour of slowly making your way through a level. I did complete the level after a couple tries, and yes it was irritating. But when my head cooled and I made my way through more intelligently and carefully, I was able to get it done. By the last level of the initial character, battle is an all-out Return of the King war- with troops coming in from all sides, archers firing, dragons flying, and huge beasts launching mortar from afar. It's madness, and takes patience to beat. But once you do, there are several characters to replay the game with from different sides of the storyline. But be warned- the first character is tough and that's on "easy".In all, this is a very satisfying and realistic game, which apparently even features online play (which I haven't had the opportunity to test). Give it a shot and be patient, and I think you'll enjoy it. But one last thing to be warned about- the box says "Custom soundtracks", and I haven't seen any evidence of that yet at 15 hours in. Oh well, solid game otherwise and only twenty bucks.

Ive been playing this game for days now & Ive lost alot of sleep because I cant get enough of it ,its a great game,but I will warn you it is a Racing simulator type game that does have a slight learning curve & it will be a harder game when you first play it,because the driving physics are based on real-world driving.The vast amount of different cars you can buy & race in FORZA is  amazing . You can buy just about any real-life car that are in showrooms today and also some of the older cars from the early sixties all the way up through to 2005.The manufacturers are all represented here from ASIA,North America(USA),Germany,Italy,United Kingdom,Sweden,France,Korea,Spain.You could buy a 1991 Honda CRX SI and upgrade it to about 580 HP & race it against a Ferrari ENZO. You have a ton of different race series from Point to Point, Amateur, Professional, Championship series,  & Long Endurance races which require pit-stops. Each race is limited to your cars category from D class, C class, B class, A class , S class, R class.Classes D through S have four subclasses ,with 1 being the highest rated & 4 being the lowest. Class R has three subclasses R-GT, R-GTS, & P1. You cars class will raise as you upgrade it & you can sell,& remove parts,adversly you can lower your cars class if you remove parts. There are also brand specific races like Impreza vs.Lancer, RX7 vs. Supra ,American Muscle event,Roadster Challenge,Club Mustang event,Light Weight Challenge,300 HP challenge & many many more.There's also FW drive event,AWD event,MR event & many more.The vast number of different class restricted races is mindboggling ,this game is HUGE! You can Upgrade your cars with a large amount of options including Intake/Exaust,Fuel Ignition,Turbo Charger, Supercharger,Intercooler,& you can swap up to bigger engines ,say example you could put a b18c5 engine from an Integra type R into any Civic.Also you can upgrade your cars other parts like, Tires from Y-rated ,DOT,to Slicks,Brakes,Transmission,Clutch & Flywheel,Weight reduction,Suspension.You can also add body kit parts from Front & Rear bumpers,Side skirts,Roll Cage,Hood,Rims,Spoilers. You can custom paint your cars from about 80 different colors.You can add custom  Decals & Vinyls on your cars left side ,top side,front bumper,rear bumper,& wing & change the shape color of each Vinyl for a completly unlimited amount of custom options.You can move,size,spin,tilt,EACH vinyl & decal & layer them up to 100,you could easily spend hours alone on vinyl applications. You can FINETUNE your cars set-up from Front & Rear tire pressure,adjust each individual gear ratio,adjust degree of camber /toe/castor,adjust ride height front & rear, adjust spring tension from soft to firm,adjust Damping Bump & Rebound,Adjust AERO downforce on front bumper & spoiler/wing, adjust Differential accell & decel,adjust Braking balance & pressure & the E-brake slow/fast.You can then go test your adjustments on any track youve unlocked & while your on the track you can fine tune it as your driving a test run in the pause menu.You can then save your cars tune set-up & then load that set-up before any race to match the track your gonna race on.You also can get a Benchmark setting to see what your adjustments have done ,it will show you Acceleration 0-60mph time ,0-100mph time, Top Speed,Braking Distance In feet ,& Lateral G's. As you win races & championships you will get credits towards purchasing more cars or parts,Also sponsors will give you discounts on parts when you win races & championships.Car manufacturers will give you free cars for winning races,series,& championships.The graphics are pretty good in this game ,the only negative thing is the people look like cardboard cutouts,but its still looks pretty good alot of nice detail.The New York & Tokyo tracks are realy nice. The cars all look fantastic and after youve finished a race you can watch and/or save your replay which looks fantastic.The strongest part of this game is the racing gameplay which is outstanding! And I did notice a big difference in performance after you add parts to your car and/or fine tune it .Its a very realistic racing game that does have a learning curve to get used to ,but once you get familiar with the driving physics its realy fun. The developers did a great job with this game & it shows. FORZA is must own for any fan of Racing sims & it could possibly win game of the year award ... HINTS: I noticed some reviewers saying that they couldnt adjust the steering response & control .But you can by adjusting everything from the camber to the tire & the front bumber rear wing downforce not to mention a TON of other adjustments that can be done to make the cars handle alot better .You can adjust the understeer/oversteer which will effect the smoothness of driving physics, but you cant adjust many of these things until you purchase the available upgrades.Also  if your having problems with high-powered rear wheeled cars spinning out, try adjusting the toe/camber & also the tire pressure for front & rear.A good combo is a lower pressure rear wheel & a higer pressure front. It affects the oversteer/underseer balance. But it might be opposite for some drivers.Try different tire pressures & for better handling . One of the best handling cars in the game is the PORSCE 959 ,its handles extremly well because its a four wheel drive car & can be upgraded to a S class car, In which I had great success with up against the mighty Chrysler ME 4-12 in the S class races & the mighty TVR 12 CYLINDER.The ME 4-12 is very hard to control because of its rear wheeL drive.Another good thing to remember is to go very easy into the brakes ,dont ever slam on the brakes you'll just slide all over the place. Remeber slow is fast in the tight turns . Also if you wanna be a better driver in the long run turn off ALL of the assists except for the green ASSIST line so you'll have a great adavantage in knowing just how fast you can barrell into a turn & try different apex lines into the turn .The green assist line isnt always the best or fastest line.But and I say but that makes a big difference in how your car is FINE-TUNED. FORZA is absolutly the most advanced & most in depth racing game I have ever played. Move over GT4 ,FORZA is in town.
I had this game on preorder for nearly a year, and when it came out I purchased the HALO 2 special edition box that came with, the tin case and two CD's one with the game on it, and one with a DVD showing the making of Halo 2. I was also told that there would be a CD with the Halo 2 soundtrack. When I first opened the tin case, I expected a separate place to store each CD, however, the two CD's were stored in the same place on top of each other. Not a big deal, but its kind of cheap that they would do that. Also there is no soundtrack in the special edition case.Overall Halo 2 is a very good game, but not as good as the original in my opinion.  I originally thought this game was painfully boring, but the later levels in this game were in fact very fun and involving.  I just wish it could have been a little longer and also the middle levels to be as fun as the last ones.Graphics: The best part of this game is the graphics. The graphics in Halo 2 are much clearer and crisper than the original, and is the best of my XBOX collection. If you don't look hard enough, you will think that you are watching a movie. The characters and textures in this game are rendered near perfectly and also the lighting effects were done very well.  The scenery looks almost lifelike especially when you are outside.  These are the best graphics I have seen in a game ever in my opinion.  Graphics get a perfect 10.Sound: The sound in this game is also very well done; the biggest disappointment here however is that the sounds of the guns do not have the "punch" as the weapons from the original game. Everything sounds like a BB gun, the only gun that sounds pretty good is the sniper rifle. The voiceovers are a nice touch and I like them fairly well. Even though some of the Covenant voiceovers are cheesy. The music is also pretty well done, but falls a bit short of the original game.Gameplay: This is what hurts the game the most.  Bungie did not do a good job of getting you involved in the game on the first and middle levels. I mean you are there, but you don't feel like you are there. The game does not really have any distinct mission goals and is basically a shoot everything that moves game. There is no shortage of enemies you will often find you run out of bullets and have to run around picking up guns off the ground. The annoying flood is back and they are still very annoying, they even made those flood "bugs" stronger, and they will kill you if you don't shoot them. In the first Halo, you could just let them pop off of you and your shield will only be damaged a little. Now if you do that, you shield will go down fast and you will die fast. Another annoying thing about the game play is that you have no idea how much energy you have left once you loose your shield, expect a lot of "random" deaths because you just don't expect something just brushing up against you to kill you. The middle levels are looooong, repetitive and boring. Good thing you can save at anytime your last checkpoint so you don't have to sit at the TV for an hour just to complete one level.  However, like I mentioned earlier, the later levels are very fun to play and once I got past the last boring level in the game, I played Halo all the time.Another thing I must mention about the game is that I really don't like how the game switches control between the Master Chief and a Covenant arbiter. It sucks and makes the game a bit confusing.  The corniest part of the game is that every character can drive every vehicle, yep, Covenant can ride in Scorpions in the human warthog. If you think that is bad then please let me finish, the flood too can ride in human and covenant vehicles. They can't walk straight or barely shoot, but they have enough dexterity to operate a tank or jeep? Please!! Get the hell out of here!!! When I first saw a warthog driving towards me shooting at me, I thought it was the covenant, but when it got closer, I saw it was the flood riding 3 deep in the warthog! One in the driver's seat, one in the passenger seat and one in operating the turret!! When I first saw that I nearly burst out laughing, it had to be funniest thing I seen in a video game in a long time.I pushed through the boring levels, and was very impressed with the final ones.  However the ending was very disappointing.  I could not believe it was over that quick.  In fact, when I first beat the game, for some reason my XBOX did not play the credits, and I was returned the to main menu after a final cut scene, so I played the final part of the game again, and this time I did get the credits.  I just stared at the screen in disbelief, as I could not believe that this game was over so quickly.  On top of that, it leaves you hanging, I guess that was Microsoft's idea, in order to get even more anticipation for Halo 3, which almost certainly will come out based on Halo 2's ending!I am pretty satisfied with the game overall, does it live up to the hype?  Not in my opinion, but it still is a great game.  I originally said I hated it, but I am glad I did give it a chance.I don't plan to play on XBOX live because it is saturated with immature kids who act stupid and mess up the game.  Not to mention all the lame cheaters on XBOX Live.  In fact I am going to cancel my subscription before it renews next year!

The quality of Halo 2 the game aside, I direct this review at the quality of of the Limited Collector's Edition as a package for the game.The case itself is a durable metal snap case with a minimalist design featuring the logo and 'Limited Collector's Edition' on the front and a grayscale Master Chief on the back.  This case will surely survive the occasional beatings a lot better than a regular DVD case, but be warned that the outer metal casing is thin and prone to dents.  It is therefor wise to keep it in the provided plastic sheath that superimposes the feature list and legal information on the front and back.The one star off is purely indicative of some of the content present on the second disc's Making Of featurette which is needless and frustratingly distracting from the point of the mini-documentary.  That said, the second disc is a healthy collection of Behind-The-Scenes clips and montages showing the numerous stages of development, from voice-actors in the studio to their early E3 demo.  The second disc is competant as a whole, but nothing standout.Included with the LCE ('Limited Collector's Edition') is a small 4 page pamphlet that highlights some textual exerpts from various characters from the game world.  It serves a little bit of flavor, but nothing more as it does little to expand on the overall plot of Halo.Personally, my favorite inclusion with this LCE is the tweaked instruction manual.  Whereas in the general retail copy of Halo 2, the manual featured Master Chief on the front, the LCE's manual features a random Sangheili Elite.  More than that though, while the manual is mostly identical, all of the flavor text in the original release that instructs the reader from the perspective of the UNSC is changed to reflect the perspective of the Covenant which perfectly mirrors the two sides of the story in Halo 2 where you play as both Master Chief and The Arbiter.  It's the little things like how the pages are purple instead of orange, the control map says 'Active Camo' instead of 'Flashlight', and the opening plot summary changes the noble Master Chief standing straight, standard issue Battle Rifle armed at the ready, to a very different image which features a darker Master Chief highlighted by a red glow and apparently lurking around with a rocket launcher.  The change in flavor text extends to the weapon & vehicle section which features Covenant tech first before insultingly listing off the &#34;primitive implements of war&#34;.  I leave this review with a snippet from the Covenant's description of the Magnum:&#34;Almost laughably weak in most circumstances; however, Human pistol fires metallic projectiles which can be dangerous when fired very accurately.  Often used as last resort by desparate Humans and one of their least threatening devices.&#34;

Halo returns with even better graphics, characters and terrain.Explore even more landscapes, hunt down Prophets (leaders of the Covenant) and master any weapon that is put before you.I was very much pleased with Halo 2. The graphics are better than Halo 1! More weapons mean more things you can wield and use against the enemy.Hop in awesome vehicles such as the Scorpion (a heavily armed tank) the Warthog (a unique vehicle that can carry a machine gun or blaster cannon), the Wraith, (the Covenants'  tank), the Ghost, (a very effective speeder) and more. There are too many vehicles to name that you can drive/fly.Another plus to this game: You can now be a Covenant Elite, the Sangheili! A humiliated ranking officer that was stripped of his rank and made to go on a mission to kill the parasite (creepy looking guys), but he learns that the Covenants `Great Journey' is a lie, and starts civil war within the Covenant. Long story, so I'll let you discover new weapons, vehicles, characters, twist and turns and more in this game as you fight for your life!Cheats--The Needler is an awesome weapon, if you hold down the trigger, many needlers will fly towards the enemy, and if you fire enough, they will explode on impact.If you hold the Plasma Pistol down, it will form a powerful plasma `bullet'.The Lekgolo (BIG, porcupine looking guys) are extremely tough foes, but there is a weak spot to them! Their one (and only) weak spot is their mid-sectiont! It glows from their side to their back, a sniper bullet (2 at most) will extinguish the threat.When battling the Parasite, use the shotgun against the little spider looking guys, and the machineguns against the two legged parasite.

This game is awesome but before you buy it let me tell you exactly what it comes with number one the Halo 4 game disc plus the multi-player download disc and now for the Dlc. The DLC will come in two cards in the case one for the Avatar items which are the master chief cloak from the Halo 5 trailer, a UNSC T-shirt and a Ghost avatar prop. The second card has all the goodies the War-games map pass (which includes the Majestic, Castle, and Crimson map packs each including 3 maps for a total of nine and two exclusive helmets) the Champions Bundle which includes the all new ricochet Armor and new game type plus two new ricochet inspired maps and the infinity armor pack that includes the mark V armor from the first Halo, the Prefect Forerunner armor, and the coveted ODST armor along with the steel skin pack which basically is all the guns turned gold colored and other multi colored gunsand the final thing it comes with is all the pre order exclusive content which was previously unavailable unless you bought this game at a specific store which includes  Recruit PRME, Venator RPTR, Gungnir PULS, Oceanic CRCT, Hazop FRST, CIO WEB, Strider, Scanner, Locus, and Deadeye armor plus Spartan, Prime, Mjolnir, Falcon, Assassin, Bonebreaker, Bulletproof, and Corbulo, Battle Rifle ACT, Assault Rifle PRM, and LightRifle IMP. anyway hope this helps you to buy this awesome pack.
The best game ever has just got better. The limited collector's edition has the same halo 2 game in a collectable tin case plus a bonus DVD containing the making of halo 2 deleted scenes and characters Halo 1 and Halo 2 cutscenes and more. It may not make a difference to some people but it is generally up to you whether you want to pay the extra five bucks to get the limited edition. Copies of these are strictly limited and are likely to be sold out after christmas. So you can get it before christmas and you can get one of the last ones at your local game store. Good luck

I lost my old Halo 2 disc ages ago and I finally decided to buy a &#34;new&#34; used copy. Played it with my brother and we would have played all night had my mom not yelled at us for playing until the early hours of the morning (c'mon mom, I'm 21!). Anyways, amazing game and I'm glad I bought it again.

Madden 2002 is a very good football game that falls just a little short of five stars.  I like the game an awful lot and have played a great deal (over 100 games (15 minute quarters of course) so far and will play a lot more) but there are some flaws.  In no particular order...The graphics in Madden are really nothing special.  They aren't terrible and the player animations during the game are nice, but the backdrops are dull and all too often you see players walk right through each other in the after play animations.Not nearly enough work was put into the experience of playing defense.  Madden has a very nice training mode for offensive plays which really carefully explains everything from blocking assignments to reading pass coverage.  There is also a sometimes nifty &quot;Ask Madden&quot; feature in offensive playcalling in which the game will reccomend offensive plays when prompted and even provide some reasoning for the choice but there is no such feature for defense.  You are pretty much on your own when it comes to calling plays on defense beyond the vague reccomendation in the EAsy play mode that you run 4-3 against the run and Nickel or Dime against the pass.  But that doesn't help explain the subtle differences between and 4-3 &quot;Thunder&quot; and a 4-3 &quot;Lightning&quot;.  Which is better against short yardage running plays?  Which is better against play action or screens?  You can get some ideas from looking at the small diagram of the play, but on the whole there is a lot lacking in defensive play calling.It is far too easy to run the football.  Running blindly won't work; but if you pay attention to the way the play is diagramed and follow your blocks, it isn't hard to rush for 250 yards on 20 to 30 carries in every game against the hardest difficulty setting (All Madden) with all the defensive AI settings cranked up as high as they go.  In contrast it is far too hard to pass the ball.  You really must read the defense and go through progressions (just throwing to your primary reciever or throwing to the same reciever over and over will not work) and that's quite fun, but recievers will drop balls way, way too often no matter how softly (or how hard) you throw the ball.  And if your reciever does not have the coverage beat by at least two steps the pass will be tipped or intercepted about half the time as defensive backs controlled by the computer seem to be blessed with superhuman closing speed.Another minor annoyance is the announcing.  Madden and Summerall are clear and conversational, but a lot of their comments are very out of place.  For example, five minutes into the first quarter you get the ball for the first time down a field goal and you run the ball for your first play.  Summerall will announce, shocked &quot;These guys still think they have time to establish the run!&quot;  And Madden, the sage, will respond, &quot;When you're down like this, it's time to put your faith in your quarterback.&quot;  Um, yeah.Finally, it is very hard to play fair, realistic football.  The first three difficulty levels are so easy once you get the basic controls down that it is no trouble at all to win by anywhere from five to ten touchdowns...and that's no fun.  The only level that can challenge you at all is All Madden and it does that by openly cheating.  The opposing defensive line will slice through your pass protection like a battle axe through butter without ever having to blitz, their receivers never drop balls (and, indeed, their defensive line has better hands than your best receiver), the computer's pass protection is near perfect unless you blitz with two extra men.  You will be penalized two or three times as often as the other team (and after about half of your big plays).  I think this could be fixed up some by forcing the computer to play fair (instead of cheating in the most blatant of ways) but then also teaching it how to play against the run a little better so you can't just run them over every game.Despite what it may sound like so far in the review, I really do think Madden 2002 is a fantastic game.  I really like the momentum based physics system and the game does a better job than any other of capturing the *feel* of real football (with the exception of the poor AI run defense).  The game comes with a ton of options in all its formats.  In its franchise mode you can create players, draft players, sign free agents, trade, progress players from poorly rated rookies to top notch stars over a few seasons, etc.  In season mode you can even edit the attribues of existing players (something I found necessary to make some of the players better match their real life counterparts (Mike Vick running slower than most fullbacks was just wrong, for example)).  This is actually a really neat option as it allows you to play the game you're in the mood for.  If you want a real high scorer, go in an jack up both teams offenses.  If you want a real low scorer, go in and pump up the defenses, etc.  There is a robust practice modes (although you can't practice with created or edited teams, which is annoying).  There is also a nice situation mode and a mini-game: the 2 minute drill (go in with any team against any team and see how many points you can score in 2 minutes).  Another nice feature are the Madden Cards.  You can earn challenge points for scoring in the 2 minute drill or for completing &quot;challenges&quot; in a regular game (i.e. throw for 300 yds, etc.) and use these points to buy packs of cheat cards that open up hidden teams and stadiums, boost current players and bring old ones out of retirement, or change other game conditions.In summary, if you like football games, go ahead and get this one.  You'll have a lot of fun with it (especially against friends) but don't expect perfection.  I hope I haven't turned anyone off of the game with some of my rants, but I also hope someone from EA Sports reads this and makes the appropriate adjustments.

You will be penalized two or three times as often as the other team (and after about half of your big plays).  I think this could be fixed up some by forcing the computer to play fair (instead of cheating in the most blatant of ways) but then also teaching it how to play against the run a little better so you can't just run them over every game.Despite what it may sound like so far in the review, I really do think Madden 2002 is a fantastic game.  I really like the momentum based physics system and the game does a better job than any other of capturing the *feel* of real football (with the exception of the poor AI run defense).  The game comes with a ton of options in all its formats.  In its franchise mode you can create players, draft players, sign free agents, trade, progress players from poorly rated rookies to top notch stars over a few seasons, etc.  In season mode you can even edit the attribues of existing players (something I found necessary to make some of the players better match their real life counterparts (Mike Vick running slower than most fullbacks was just wrong, for example)).  This is actually a really neat option as it allows you to play the game you're in the mood for.  If you want a real high scorer, go in an jack up both teams offenses.  If you want a real low scorer, go in and pump up the defenses, etc.  There is a robust practice modes (although you can't practice with created or edited teams, which is annoying).  There is also a nice situation mode and a mini-game: the 2 minute drill (go in with any team against any team and see how many points you can score in 2 minutes).  Another nice feature are the Madden Cards.  You can earn challenge points for scoring in the 2 minute drill or for completing &quot;challenges&quot; in a regular game (i.e. throw for 300 yds, etc.) and use these points to buy packs of cheat cards that open up hidden teams and stadiums, boost current players and bring old ones out of retirement, or change other game conditions.In summary, if you like football games, go ahead and get this one.  You'll have a lot of fun with it (especially against friends) but don't expect perfection.  I hope I haven't turned anyone off of the game with some of my rants, but I also hope someone from EA Sports reads this and makes the appropriate adjustments.

First off, let may start off with these words: Madden is a challenging yet fun game. Addictive after getting into a good franchise, there are so many good things about it it'll keep you entertained forever. However, there were a few flaws:The graphics, first off, are excllent. A clean helmet reflects a beautiful shine, a dirty helmet, well... The tackles look extremely realistic, as sometimes you'll get pulled down by the leg, and sometimes you'll get creamed and knocked back a few yards. The sounds of each tackle are awsome and realistic, and sometimes when your on defense, it'll take 2 or 3 people to knock a good running back down...which is quite true in the NFL. The uniforms look very sharp, with shadows, dirty uniforms, and overall smooth figures.The stadiums look great, and it's always cool to hear the game attendance. Yes, they annouce the game attendance (like say 45,875). It changes from time to time, and big games will get big draw outs, small games will get small drawouts. Incredibly realistic.The gameplay is decent, but not great. It's always challenging, and something about it makes it too challenging. In past Madden games, it's been too easy to go to the Super Bowl every year even on the hardest settings. In this game, it's way to hard on even All Pro (Easy, Pro, All Pro, Madden Pro). First off on Gameplay, if the opposing receiver or running back breaks free, he's gone! There is no way too catch up with a receiver even with the tiniest lead. No spead gainer, no sprint button. And on offense, the CPU defenders seem to be blessed with super-human speed, catching up with a person even with a 10 yard cushion.  Your receivers always drop passes, even someone like Isaac Bruce, and is nearly impossible for the player to get a sack. All this on the all pro, I wonder what it's like on Madden... But if your like me, and have been waiting for a challenge in a madden game, this will definantly give you a challenge.Options in this game our incredible; there are so many things to do! Franchise, where u start a Franchise (optional, fantasy draft). Create a coach, salary cap, create a team (with uniforms, logos, stadiums, everything. It's from scratch u start from create a team, and the uniforms u can design!). Season, practice, training, madden cards, exibition, etc... You can create a whole new team, from the uniforms, logo, name (yes the people can pronouce the name just like u me, like say Dallas Sharks), stadium name, capacity of the stadium(a million if u want), the type of stadium (bowl, dome). U can put this team into a season, franchise (10 seasons), or even exibition. U can have a fantasy draft, salary cap, even be the coach of your team. There are so many things to do. You'll never get bored of options in this game, never.Finally, the overall depth. It's fun! The commentary, unfortunantly, hasn't changed since the 1998 version, but it's still decent... The player ratings are pretty good, the whole thing plays pretty well. There's a typical "Person in seat 73B, you have won a lifetime supply of hot dogs" from the comentor, and the players actually react to what happens. They even shake hands and high five at the end of a victory. The coaches get angry on a bad play, clench their fist in satisfaction on a well devised score.  U can really c that Ea put a lot of thought into Madden 2002.Overall, this is an excellent game, but if your not up to a huge challenge, I wouldn't buy it (go for Blitz). But if you want a realistic game, that's fun, has many options, great graphics and brings the atmosphere of the NFL into your house. This is the game for you!

But if you want a realistic game, that's fun, has many options, great graphics and brings the atmosphere of the NFL into your house. This is the game for you!
With all the high quality football games on the market, there's really only one final determining factor for your purchase: personal preference.  If you're a Madden fan, you'll probably buy Madden.  Same with the 2K series or Blitz or whatever else floats your boat.  I happen to be a Fever fan, so when Fever 2003 came out, it didn't take me long to decide which one I was going to buy.For those of you in the "undecided" bracket, let me plead the case.  Fever is a great game.  To me, it is somewhere in the middle of 2k3's great graphics and Maddens realistic play.  I think it's the most well rounded of the football games.  There are lots of plays, and they're easy to understand.  The Dynasty mode is by far the best in any game, in my opinion, and the play editor is easy to use.  The big reason for X-box owners to get Fever is that it will be a marquee game on the new X-Box Live platform.For those of you who've already played 2002, there are only a few subtle changes to 2003.  Probably only die-hard fans will notice anything past the roster changes.  The graphics are only slightly improved over 2002, and it looks like the exact same engine.  I guess they figured if it aint broke, don't fix it. The tackles and runs are far more animated than in 2002 which showed the same tackles over and over.  While the engine is pretty much the same, the shading and lighting has improved, and the weather features look a little more realistic, especially field damage.Once you get past the superficial aspects of the game, you can tell there have been other needed changes.1. Defense:  the secondary is much more of a threat than in 2002.  The computer still passes 99% of the time (unfortunately) and instead of confronting the key issue and making the comp stay on the ground more, the secondary is better at blocking passes and breaking up plays.  The A.I. is much imroved.  If you throw all the time like the comp does, the secondary will adapt and become more aggressive.  If you try to run every play, the same thing will occur.  It becomes more obvious when playing the computer, but it's also a major factor when playing against friends.2.  Officiating.  Anyone who played 2002 knows there were only about 2 calls the refs ever gave unless you accidentally encroached or made a false start on your own.  One was holding, the other was pass interference.  The officiating seems a lot tighter in 2003, and there's a lot mroe going on with the A.I controlled characters.  I've already heard one too many "holding" calls, but I guess you can't eliminate it completely.3. Dynasty mode.  Not much has changed here, but one major difference is the way players improve.  First, they improve far more slowly and less dramatic than in 2002.  Having a stellar game in the box score does not guarantee improvement.  In fact, I'm not sure what does.  On them same side of that coin, it's also difficult to get worse.  One cool feature is, after every game, they show you exactly who did or didn't improve.  It saves you the trouble of having to go to management after every game.4. Gameplay:  Overall, the teams are a lot more balanced than in 2002.  I think they've obviously tried to represent the salary caps this way.  There are dominant teams, but they're not as dominanat as in 2002 where the margins were often huge.  Teams and players now average somewhere in the 80's, and there are a lot fewer players with overall ratigns higher than 90.  Far fewer than last year.  I think they're trying to avoid players with unrealistic ratings that can achieve the superhuman (Cory Dillan on 2002 for example).  This is probably the most dramatic change, and the one that is bound to have a big impact on people used to dominating on 2002.  I used to play on the veteran or all-pro setting, but I'm getting my a$$ waxed at anything higher than novice right now.Bottom line: if you liked Fever before, you'll still like it.  They've done a lot to make the game more realisitc, without becoming tediously realistic.  If you didn't like Fever, you probably still won't.  Stick with what you like and stop hating.  To each their own.

Everyone wants to know &quot;How does NFL Fever 2002 compare to Madden 2002?&quot;  The answer is that Fever compares favorably, but is ultimately a different sort of football game.  If you always thought Madden was &quot;too arcadey&quot; then you might want to steer clear of this one, as it plants itself somewhere between the simulation efforts of Madden and Sega's NFL 2K2, and the kamikaze kinetics of the NFL Blitz series.  Fever is actually a very compelling and fun game once you get over the fact that you aren't playing Madden.Fever easily pulls off the best graphics ever in a console football game.  From the integration of many different intro shots for each play, to the exacting detail which accompanies every hit, jump, and stiff-arm, it is fantastically clear that the developers went the extra mile to really draw you in to the game and create an exciting &amp; colorful world.  The players jabber at one another, celebrate successful offensive achievements, and showboat after a steller defensive effort.  It really does make Madden look fairly pale and colorless as a result.The commentary suffers from some uneven choppiness (&quot;FIVE... yard... reception by... ENGRAM!&quot;) but does give some timely insight in certain situations (&quot;The defense is in a 3-4, a run would be successful here.&quot;)  The much-touted graphics are indeed a step-up from Madden, but are not letter-perfect.  The detailed faces are a very nice addition, but disappoint when Jerome Bettis looks nothing like Jerome Bettis.  He's detailed, but looks nothing like the real guy.  But it sure beats Madden's cheesy Kewpie-Doll faces.The bottom-line really comes down to gameplay, and Fever tends toward &quot;the big play.&quot;  Interceptions are more common than in Madden, big runs, big returns, long gains, freight-train tackles, all of it brings make Fever seem a little over-the-top, and really makes Madden seem slow &amp; pensive in comparison.  Which is why some won't take to this more reactive arcade style of gameplay.  Traditional football playcalling &amp; tactics still apply, but the realism factor is purposefully loosened to create a more no-holds-barred atmosphere designed to ramp up the fun-factor.Honestly, it took me a few times before I was ready to accept this type of football (not to mention getting used to the XBox controller) but once I did, I really started to appreciate the flair and style that Fever brings.  I guess the telling thing is that I tried to go back to Madden and really had to mentally shift gears to prepare for a different sort of football experience.  NFL Fever 2002 is fun, easy to pick up and play, easy to like, great 2-player fun, and a lot deeper than your average console football game.  And they did an admirable job of injecting some life into a stale genre by pushing the fun-factor way up while still retaining the confines of real football.If too many years of Madden is gradually putting you to sleep, get into the Fever and see how much fun a football game can be.

Amped 1 surprised me.  Out of the box I noticed that on a bright winter day, the sunlight caused the snow to twinkle just slightly as a mist of snow flakes kicked up from my board.Shortly before I hit a lift pole.D'oh... That game had a tuff learning curve, but i rose through ranks to become a superstar boarder.  What fun!When i opened amped 2 and put it up on my big screen.  Oh wow... the snow twinkling was back, but now my player breathed a small mist, the shadows were much crisper and the colors and palettes were so much better, more realistic and more enthralling.  The backgrounds and terrain are accurate and fun to explore.  In HDTV-mode the quality and effort of the artists is easy to see.  The mountains are realistic enough for my roommate to walk in and say &quot;hey four o' clock? I've skiied there!&quot;.  I'm very happy with the challenging new game types, new mountains and exciting gameplay.Once again, for true boarding fans, Amped! is the way to go.

This game was the last good Amped ever made, and the last good snowboarding game ever made.  Sure, the industry today is about pew pew pew instead of extreme sports, which is why you need to reach back to appreciate the golden age of extreme sports.  Amped 2 is everything you could want in a snowboarding game, and it takes itself seriously, not like Amped 3 which felt like it was developed by a bunch of fratboys.This game has better physics and controls than the 3rd game, and a better soundtrack.  That's all there is to it folks.

This is the only worth while fighting game to come out on the Xbox since DAO3. The main novelty of this game is the damage fighters receive during combat. Break an arm, and it dangles throughout the rest of the match, and you can't use it. You get cuts, and scars grow over them. The characters have over three times the polygon count as Dead or Alive 3, which allows for some amazing detail. In addition, the backgrounds are extremely interactive. This is a super game, and raises the bar on all others.

One of the best snowboarding games ever. Right up there with Coolboarders 2 for PS1. If you like snowboarding, this is a must!

Think about this for a minute.In the Sims 2 (which is going to be released on the same day as this consiquently) You have a character who has aspirations, dreams, hopes, can pass their DNA down through the line, and the Sims franchise will basically live your lives for you because you weigh 30 pounds over the "projected perfection" and you're too afraid to go out and live life.In other words, the Sims 2 will be the ultimate chick game and the ultimate waste of time.Now FABLE comes along and offers close to the same thing, only more.  More = violence.  Forgive me for sounding chovanist, but the idea of marrying a young lass struck with amazement at your status in the game, knocking her up, and fighting for good and evil, does comprise MORE than a game based coded personalities (no matter how many algoritims there are that make up these personalities) which after a while, I assure you will be tapped out.So, if you want to go and live life through your computer and marry Prince Charming or that raven haired woman you can't approach at work, go ahead and waste your money on the Sims.  But if you want a life experience in which you have a dramatic role in fighting off evil (or slaughtering innocence) in the world around you, while still engaging in day to day activities. Pick this up.

The hype is well deserved for Brute Force--I was quite surprised by how much tactical planning you have to do in each mission--do I send Tex up ahead and have hawk sneak up on the enemy in her sleath mod? Or can flint snipe that guard on the crossway down that hill/ Can brutus hold his ground without getting killed? Where is that enemy fire coming from?This game can becme very chaotic, very quickly! It was chilling to hear my squad cal out for a medic as they were under fire ad saying,"one more hit and I'm a goner..." yeah you can send in the clones, butit'll cost you ome serious doughif you keep messing up. Learning each member's special powers and skills was half the fun! But you can NOT waste them against the AI opponents--they're very, very smart!There will be Live downloads, but no Live multiplayer--that's the only flaw I have with it. If you have friends over often for a system ilnk throwdown, this game will be very, very popular !

This epic adventure was so much fun I finished it in a few, very intense nights. I found the characters, graphics, environments, puzzles, and music all to be extremely smart and ultimately creative. Technically, this game is flawless. I really appreciated the perfect mix of humor and fright. That and the satisfaction of outsmarting and zapping creepy adversaries made this a week of non-stop fun that almost cost me a girlfriend. Most pleasantly surprising to me was the game's reliance on cooperation between Abe and Munch in order to make progress. I has able to spin that as a learning experience for my son. ;)

This game is one of the Better RPG's on the market. You start as a young boy and as the game progresses you get older, sound familiar? *smiles* You also receive battle wounds (scars) that are visible on the spot you where wounded, my guy looks kind of like an American Indian after 30 years of knife fighting! Great story, also VERY Re-Playable, the story can be molded by your decisions and your Karma.

Previous reviews on the game kept me from purchsing this game. Unsuspectedly, I received it as a gift this x-mas, and it is better than I thought it would be. The only thing is that the voices sound weird, but not the music, the music is good it is the voices of the characters which sound echoed and like they are coming thourgh a metal tube. Other than that it is pretty decent game. I especially like the idea of the wounding and limb damage, which makes perfect sene for a fighting game. Still Mortal Kombat is way better.

My daughter got this for her 12th birthday and loved it. She likes the game that you can just drive around and pretend you're cruising the city. She pretends she's out on a driving lesson, and hits all the other cars, and people on the sidewalks. You can set it up to have heavy, or light traffic, and whether, or not you want police patroling around. Lots of different games to play on this. Perfect for kids who love to out run the law!

When I am not working on networks or teaching classes I love to play computer games. While mostly I play golf, baseball or puzzles games every now and then I like to try out something new. I found this game to be both fun and a great break from the everyday grind.The install was easy as I started with cd1 and answering a few questions and before I knew it the installation was complete. I was able to get Windows 98, ME, 200 and XP to work. The game calls for a 32MB video card and I would say this is a minimum, I would also recommend a video card with 3D acceleration.Also the hard space required is 1.5GB and I would recommend 3GB. There are several different rallys and each one has a different set of obstacles and events that can occur. I was able to play the game with the keyboard and mouse, but the gamepad or sidewinder wheel would certainly enhance the game play.The graphics are great and with a P4 processor you have very little lag in the refresh and the game runs very smoothly. I only had one game failure and that was under Windows ME, the other versions had no failures and the game played for over 3 hours at a time.While I am not an expert in this software, I found it easy to pick and play and overall I was impressed by the amount of different things that can happen when you play.

i bought this game thinking it would be something like zelda.HAH! This is like the very basic zelda where you can walk around and use 1 attack. there is no items menu or weapons menu or any menu besides the pause. this game is sooooo repetative nothing different, alllllll the same. HAH and hear this. i went to the store a few weeks after i got azirik at the same store. i bought another game (blinx which i dont highly reccomend either but its not nearly as bad as this one) and when i was buying it the salesman said &quot;and if for any reason you should not like this game...you can take it back within 7 days.&quot; and i said &quot;o i wish i knew about that when i bought azurik&quot; and he sais &quot;well, technically we shouldnt have even sold you azurik&quot;!!!!! HAHAHA this game is so bad

Yes words are misspelled. Yes they lied about the custom soundtrack. No the crappy rock music doesn't match with bloody medieval fantasy warfare. It's still a fun game, and if a game can overcome all of those flaws and still be fun then the creators have made a great game despite their failure to grasp the English language. It has an excellent storyline with all the characters. The graphics are pretty good. There are hundreds of soldiers on the maps at once with pretty good detail. I thought the voice acting was well above average but not great and no it didn't always match what was on the subtitles.I haven't played this game in almost a year but have fond memories of it and plan to pick it up again this weekend. I have the prequal "Kingdom Under Fire The Heroes" which closes most of the plot holes and answers many of the questions from this one.My best guess is that because these games are pretty challenging; most of these negative reviews are from people that couldn't hack it and got frustrated. For those losers who that applies to...go back to Mario brothers and Zelda. The rest of you should get this game if you can still find it. Check the bargain bins, it'll be well worth what you'll pay for it. I also highly recommend the Heroes. I don't think one is really better than the other, they are both great.Showtime Out

This is a good game. Has nice graphics average sound...but...AWESOME gameplay. This is one of the funnest games ive played and if not for the average graphics and sounds, it would have got a 5-star rating. It may take a while to get into, but finding new places, getting new powers, unlocking secrets, and fighting kick-a bossess make it a fair competiter. I believe people dont put enough time into this game. Like i said it takes a while but this ends up into a nice box. The story line begins at a tower, where the 6 (?) realms meet. There are 2 lore gaurdains left, Azurik and (can't remember name...dammit). The lore gaurdian that isn't Azurik is possed by the Death Realm leader and is driven to take the Death Realm disk and destroy the others. This is a very long game so expect long game time. I think it takes around 75 hours to beat. wow. I still hav't won but im close.

This is one the best golf games I have ever owned. You can create your charatures and then follow them thru their career. The graphics are really realistic, and you can upload your own soundtrack to listen to while you golf. I personally uploaded Tim McGraw's greatest hits, and that is great to listen to while I golf. This game is really fun to play with your friends.

Prior to purchasing a PS3 a couple years ago, I asked two of my guy friends (who are hardcore gamers) whether I should get a PS3 or an Xbox. They both said that I should  get a PS3 because its controller is better suited for a woman with small hands. So I went ahead and purchased a PS3 ( and also because they have more exclusive titles).Anyway, my six-year-old nephew (who resides with me) has been wanting to play Minecraft for nearly a year. Since it's exclusive on the Xbox, I went ahead and bought the console, all the while thinking, "How am I going to play any game using the Xbox controller?" I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the controller fits beautifully in my hands (and I have small hands). I actually prefer it to the PS3.My six-year-old nephew is a gamer and I have been trying to persuade him into using the right analog stick on the PS3 for an entire year. He just couldn't get the hang of it. So, within a week of purchasing Minecraft on the Xbox, he began using the right analog stick (on his own) and exclaimed to me that it's easier to play this way. The placement of the analog sticks is better than the PS3. I asked my nephew which controller he prefers (and he loves playing on the PS3) and he said the Xbox controller.I have two teeny tiny cons: Firstly, like the Wiimote, the Xbox controller uses AA batteries instead of charging it using a USB cable. That said, I've played over 25 hours on the Xbox controller and I still haven't changed the batteries. Secondly, the D-Pad (while in comparison to the PS3) isn't as good and precise.That said, I love this controller and I recommend it.
The Xbox 360's controller is without a doubt my pick for the best gaming controller of the past decade.Its curved design fits comfortably in the hand, and feels solid.  The placement of the two analog sticks feels natural, especially when playing first-person games.  I grew up with Nintendo, and up until 2006 the PlayStation 2's DualShock was my go to controller.  Then I got my hands on the 360's controller.  Wow, oh wow!  It felt natural.  I'm serious, the instant this controller got in my hands it felt as if I'd always used one (and I never played an original Xbox at all!).  The layout is clean, and easy to use.  After playing it I can't understand why anyone would want a controller with the two analog sticks on the bottom of the controller (although, certain game types do still play better with the DualShock style controller, the Xbox controller fits me better for most games).The Xbox 360 Wireless Controller is heavier than controllers given by Sony and Nintendo, but I consider this a good thing.  I worry about the strength of the Nintendo Wii/GameCube controller (referring to the "classic" game controllers and not the nun chuck, etc) and Sony's DualShock.  They feel like they have a lot of empty space and that the shell is waiting for one good drop to break.  The Xbox 360 controller is rugged, with elegant curves that make it feel like it was born for hardcore gaming.That look and feel doesn't lie.  And it holds true to that: My controllers have seen some severe abuse over the years.  I've owned two Xbox 360s, and the controllers I had for the original may be battered and bruised, but still function perfectly well.  I own a Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo 64, PlayStation 2, GameCube, and PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 Wireless Controller is the only controller I've never had fail.  I've had to replace controllers for all of those consoles.  In six years I've never once had to replace a Xbox 360 Wireless controller.  (With the exception of the PS3, because I've only owned it for 1 year so we'll see how long it lasts).If you own a 360 you already know what's great about this controller.  If you have the money, and a controller for the long term you should definitely purchase the official Microsoft produced controller because it is well worth it for the build quality, and longevity.  Microsoft's team really knocked it out of the park, and the next Xbox's controller has a high standard to live up to.  Until then I intend to make the most of what I consider to be the best game controller of the last decade.
Despite other opinions - this controller is only different in color scheme from the older controllers.In fact - my left trigger annoyingly squeaks - ironically all my older controllers (5 in total - including the red and blue ones - which I use as spares and for friends)never squeaked. Basically the color scheme is all black - no gray. And a shiny garish chrome power button. It has the exact same feel the older controllers have. I think some of the reviews claiming it has a different feel or has different performance has to be imaginative wishful thinking.I noticed no change in performance (and due to the squeaking trigger actually worse quality than my older ones!)I also noticed no different power consumption as compared to the earlier controllers. I use rechargeable batteries so can't comment on AA battery drain - but again - I'd be wary of opinions that somehow this controller had been redesigned to reduce power consumption when everything else is identical to the older versions. Unless you actually see controlled tests regarding power consumption I'd take these sort of opinions as opinions - not fact.If you like the new color scheme then buy it but do not expect it to be any different from any earlier controller.
The Glossy Black Xbox 360 Controller is the best Microsoft has made, ever. It has a sleek and stylish glossy design, which looks good and fits great in your hands while gaming. Apart from the awkward protrusion from the central rear for the batteries, the design is much better than other 360 Controllers and even the best controllers for other gaming systems. The locations of the buttons, thumbsticks, D-Pad and Triggers are ideal for two-handed use, and function in a very impressive manner when playing a wide range of games. It also offers an impressive 30-foot range from the Console and signal passes without noticeable decay through many materials used in Entertainment Centers and Walls. Battery life is also impressive, even with the Vibrate feature on, although it lasts longer on non-rechargable batteries like the ones included when new as opposed to rechargeable battery packs that are offered separately.
After playing my Xbox for about 5 years (yikes ... it has been that long already!?), I was in desperate need for a controller upgrade as my current controller had worn out its welcome and the joystick pads were all but textureless.  My brothers purchased a newer xbox than mine, and it came with a black controller with the matte gray lining.  The controller really felt no different than my white ones, and I really liked the black, so I thought I would get this one, and get it in gloss just to mix it up a bit.  I was surprised to find that the quality of this controller was far superior than the black and gray controller.  I am not sure if the batch that I got uses different parts or what, but the controller feels a lot more sturdy, the joysticks are nice and strong (they dont wiggle much in their neutral position) and the buttons have a stronger feel to them.  Now some people might say that this is because it is a new controller, but I have been using this one now for about 5 months and the controller is just like the day I bought it.  Again, I dont have proof that the components of this controller have changed, but they sure do feel better than any of the older xbox controllers.
The Xbox 360 controller was perfect upon release, in my opinion. I greatly prefer it to the playstation controller. This updated 360 controller isn't much different than the original, but has a few tweaks.As many have pointed out, the D-pad has changed a bit. While I didn't feel a big difference, it's still an improvement. If you're expected this newer D-pad to be bounds above the old, then you'll be disappointed but it is slightly better. The sticks also have a different tread on them than the older 360 controllers. At first it felt a little weird on my thumbs, only because it's different. After a few minutes I got used to them and now the older grips feel weird to me. And, of course, the color scheme is great.If you're expecting this controller to make you a better gamer, you're in for disappointment. But if you're looking for a new Xbox 360 controller I would recommend this one because it keeps the same great feel of the 360 controller with a few performance tweaks to make it even better.
This controller is sleek, durable and comfortable to hold. My sons (ages 8 and 7) had no trouble adapting to the styling. Even with their small hands, they have no trouble tapping and using all the buttons, sticks and triggers.The cordless controllers cost a few dollars more than the corded models but are worth the additional money. Our sons like to move around the playroom, shifting from their floor chairs to the sofa. We appreciate the 30-foot range and up to 40 hours of life on two AA batteries. We prefer to use rechargeable batteries instead of spending another $20 on Microsoft's Play and Charge Kit.We purchased theXbox 360 4GB Console with Kinectlast year as a family Christmas present. It was our first game console, so we can't compare thisXbox 360 Wireless Controllerto previous models. We will keep track of the controller's durability and report back should any problems arise.Rating: Five stars.
In the past year I bought theXbox 360 250GB Halo Reach Console Bundleand have logged many hours of bothHalo ReachandCall of Duty: Black Opswith the provided controllers. After having several buttons begin to stick and stop responding completely I decided to order a new controller.This controller worked as advertised and I have had no issues whatsoever. I have put it through many hours of use over the past three months and it has performed flawlessly. Don't be deterred by the 'glossy black' claim. I found my controller to be less glossy than I had imagined, which I prefer. I am looking forward to many more hours of enjoyment.One thing to be considered is that this specific product runs on 2 AA batteries and comes with a pair to start you off. I would suggest purchasing a battery pack if you plan on playing often.
This Xbox 360 Wireless Controller - Glossy Black work just as good as the original one. The only difference is that you need 2 'AA' batteries for it. I have used the rechargeable 'AA' batteries and the USB charger, it charges the batteries just fine! So in my opinion this Controller is better than the original! You can use disposable 'AA' batteries or to keep with the green thing, use the 'AA' Ni-Cad Rechargeable batteries or even get an original rechargeable power pack! You now have a very versatile controller for your XBOX 360!
I got this to match my new 4GB 360 with Kinect. I could not stand the thought of having a white controller with everything else being black (including the other controller)! It is a great replacement for my four year old white controllers which have begun to show wear and tear (squeaky trigger buttons, d-pad not responsive enough, too much play in the buttons, etc.) I recommend picking up the play and charge kit with this to get a matching black battery. Again, having a white battery with a black controller is a no-no in my house. (My wife has to make sure everything matches!! :) ) As always, great price on Amazon - especially with the play and charge kit.

Kinect Adventures is most likely your first hands-on experience with the Xbox add-on Kinect sensor.  Mine came with the 4G Xbox system.  You don't need anymore remote controllers; instead your whole body serves as the controller via the Kinect camera.  You flail your arms; you kick and scream, and do all kinds of unimaginable body contortions, and to add insults, it can be captured by the very same camera to send to the vastness bowels of the internets!  Who knows?  You can be the next laser sword wielding boy sensation if you can stand all the embarrassment from your friends and family relatives.The idea is to drag your lazy bones, stand in front of the tube and save you from becoming a hapless couch potato.  Your first few hours will surely be a lot of fun.  You can have another player join you by simply position themselves on your side.  He can be a boy or a girl depending on which side he jumps into.May favorite is "Roaring Rapids", you ride on an inflatable and try to collect as many points by maneuvering with your body.  When you jump, the boat jumps with you and you can reach objects high on the rock.  By performing successive jumps with a friend, you can even reach higher, even up on top of the clouds.I also love the game similar to a dodge ball, although you just have to hit targets by slapping and kicking the ball as opposed to getting the blissful satisfaction of hitting someone's vulnerable parts, it is a very active game that can make you gasp for air after finishing a set.  You can also use your knees, your body for blocking, or your head.  Not to be outdone, the log obstacle course is likewise a very fun game.  You have to jump, dock, and position your arms and legs to reach objects to get as many points as possible.  Other games are popping bubbles where you are in outer space, weightless and can fly by flapping your arms.  The game that I don't care very much is an underwater lab where you have to patch leaks from the damages created by sharks, and other sea monsters.Overall, Adventures is a very fun game.  It just doesn't have as much repeat value as Dance Central, etc.
CORVETTE Z06 IS GREAT BUT FERRARI F50 IS THE NEW MAN ON THE BLOCK. THE Z06 HAS YET TO BE EQUALLED HUH?

We were spurred on to buy the Kinect system in part because we played this game at a friend's house.It seems that many video games are enjoyed only by the player or, at most, a couple of players (excluding the games where internet connectivity is required).  This is a game that will entertain both players and observers, and is appropriate for the entire family.You will jump, dodge, sway, swing, duck through obstacles, flying objects, trees, rocks, moving platforms, trains.  The graphics are beautiful and amusing, without being disorienting as some of these games of shifting perspective can be.  Most of all the game is interactive.  The family gets up and moving.  You look absurd trying to dodge invisible objects---that's the fun of it.The Kinect is an amazingly accurate tool.  Yes, it does not detect minute movements, but it is very good for a $100 motion-detection component.  After all, you buy headphones that cost more than that!  We live in technologically riveting times.  In ten years, the Kinect will be out-dated, yet you will have had a marvelous time.
Like most of everyone who bought a Kinect, this game came with it.Gameplay: As you should know by now, the game requires the Kinect sensor (hooked into the Xbox 360) to play. Your gameplay is controlling the onscreen action with your body using your arms, legs, head and body movements. The Kinect sensor captures your body movements very well. One event is you traverse a river while on a raft, moving your body left or right and jumping to control the action. Another is a submarine with glass windows that keep cracking from sharks and other creatures. You use your head, arms, and feet to stop the leaks. A few other events and you can even add a 2nd player to the action.Conclusion: As the flagship game for the Kinect, Microsoft delivers a quality game and promising start. If you bought a Kinect sensor and didn't get this game with it, then it's probably worth picking up for $20 bucks or less. Not really worth more than that. A solid 4 star game for the Kinect.
Kinect Adventures!The game consists of many fun mini-games. This includes rally ball, raft game, rail car game, plugging leaks, and popping bubbles in an anti-gravity environment. The Kinect sensitivity isn't perfect but it does a great job replicating your body movements in the game. I found myself bunny hopping just to see my avatar bunny hopping. It doesn't seem to replicate high kicks though, it tends to stop at waist level probably assuming no one needs to kick that high in the game. For some odd reason, it always defaults to the raft game when starting up the game even though I've managed to play through most of the adventure mode.I didn't have to buy this game since it was included with my Kinect sensor purchase, but I'd probably consider buying it at a bargain price or perhaps borrowing/renting the game since it is fairly simple but fun especially with 2 players.Overall: 4/5 stars, not the best in Kinect sensitivity but very good. The undersea leak plugging game is annoying because it starts to ignore some of my movements during hectic parts of the game. The rally ball and raft games are extremely fun!
We have a ton of games for our XBox 360 Kinect, but it's always Kinect Adventures that we pull out when visitors come over. It's fun and easys to learn.In essence you get a collection of mini-games which use your body to play. You don't have to hold controllers or learn buttons. For dodge-ball, a person simply stands in front of the screen and when a ball comes at them they whap it with their hand, foot, or head. How easy can that be? Everyone "gets it" within seconds and is immediately having fun.There are river rapids where you jump to make the raft jump. There are obstacles courses where you do all sorts of crazy moves to gather points and avoid the obstacles. You plug up leaks in an aquarium with your body parts. You pop bubbles. Mostly, you have enormous amounts of fun.It's not even an "exercise game" - but playing it does easily burn calories and get you into shape. You want to keep playing long after you're tired out!We have young kids and older folks all wanting to take their turns. It's a nice mix of games. Someone who's not that fond of game A will adore game B and so on. I adore the dodge ball game. My friend loves the raft game.You can play solo or with someone else. It's a maximum of two players, which on one hand is a shame but I'm also not sure how you could fit four people in one space and have them all flailing around without hurting each other.Are there any down sides here? The games are definitely about motion. So if you have a tiny space you might not be able to play - but that would be true with any Kinect game. If you do not have the ability to be fully in motion - for example if you're in a wheelchair - you would also have issues with this game. So those are things to be aware of.But that being said, I highly recommend this game. We've played thousands of games over the years, and a large chunk of our recent reviews have been about motion games on the various platforms. This game is one we keep coming back to.Rating: 5/5.We purchased this game with our own funds in order to do this review.
Project Gotham has endured the inevitable comparison to Sony's GT franchise, and in my opinion, has fared rather well.  As a gamer who has experienced both, I would not rate either one higher than the other.  Each game has its own unique characteristics and features to provide adequate replay value.  The licensing agreement with Ferrari and Porsche was a real coup for the Gotham team, but it is not enough to put it over the top when comparing it to the legend of GT.  The Kudos point system in Gotham makes it a bit too arcade-like rather than a true sim.  It is still a solid car game experience and I would recommend it to anyone with an Xbox who enjoys GT or other similar sim games.

First of all, I dont own Xbox, i own a PS2, but I was impressed big time with RalliSport Challenge. The car physics are remarkably realistic with spin-outs, powerslides, jumps, car damage e.t.c. A plethora of racetracks on different terrain which are accurate and a good selection of licensed rally cars are available.(Subaru WRC impreza's my fave).The game's AI is sufficiently difficult for a challenge, and u can't afford to take your eye off the track for a sec. I'm a racing game nut, but you don't have to be to enjoy this title. The selection screen is easy to navigate, so for those impatient one's, you can jump right in. I'm at my cousins house every weekend to play this title...considering i hate Xbox and it's owners ;-). This is a must have. Two Thumbs Up.
