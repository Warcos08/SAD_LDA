good product but upon turning it on some LED lights were missing and i opened the controller to check and only one LED light was on the circuit board
Boring!  This game has nothing to rave over and alot to dispise.  Rent it before buying, or you will be disappointed in losing 50 bucks.

This so-called halo-killer was sad in comparison. Lame graphics, pathetic story, & characters no one cared about. Worst game Ever.

Nice graphics, a few exciting moments, and kinda cute. But the gameplay is bland and and doesn't do a good job of captivating the player.

This game is ever so boring. It follows the general Microsoft philosophy of features over everything else: gameplay, story, mechanics, enemy A.I., interesting characters and enemies, locations, and most importantly, fun.I'd like to quickly liken this game to Thanksgiving dinner. It's like Grandma (Micrsoft Game Studios) worked really hard on the bread, potatoes, stuffing, pie and apple cider or whatever but completely forgot to make the turkey. It's not Grandma's fault; she's old. But she doesn't try to charge you fifty bucks to eat her dinner, does she? If she does, don't eat it; many good Chinese restaurants are open on Thanksgiving. If you're not American, you might be scratching your head wondering what "Thanksgiving" is. Thanksgiving means this game sucks.To say this game pales in comparison to Halo is an understatement. This game ignored everything it could have learned from Halo. Halo had a plot, interesting characters, fluid controls, good weapons, and addictive gameplay. Brute Force has none of this.Halo was by no means a hard game, but Brute Force barely even punishes you for dying. It hurts your score? You can just keep respawning until you beat the level every time! Talk about taking any possible sense of satisfaction away that I could have gotten. To make things worse, there is basically no enemy A.I. at all. The basic gist of it is: hide behind rock, shoot, hide, shoot, hide, shoot, die. To try to conceal this, the levels were sprinkled with places where the enemy simply wouldn't appear until after I walked by them. I knew these places were coming, but there simply was nothing I could do, for the enemies didn't even exist until the instant they surrounded me. Clever, guys. Real clever.From the very beginning of this game through the ending credits, this game was the least entertaining game I've played since... well, uhh... I'm sure I can think of a game worse than Brute Force... hold on... hmm... maybe this is the worst game EVER! That is quite an accomplishment. At the very beginning, the game was terrible because I had used such rubbery controls very seldom in the past, and certainly not since Playstation (One), but by the time I got used to the controls about five minutes into the first level (it thankfully allowed me to somewhat imitate my Halo control setting), I was already bored of the wishy washy combat and crappy missions.The game has many features that I've craved ever since Perfect Dark like being able to track your kills and other stats, but some of the most important features for any modern action game are missing here: vehicles, challenge, plot, and fun.Because when it comes down to it, the most important test of any game is whether or not it's any fun, and this game just isn't any fun.

Azurik's an interesting game. The elemental combination system that's at the heart of the game is an interesting one, and could have provided for some unique and creative puzzles, situations, and combat. However, in many respects, the game falls flat on its face.Combat, for one, as frequent as it is, is entirely uninteresting. A,A,A,B is the name of the game, and while you've got to make sure you're using the right elemental combinations, the lack of a reward for beating a monster (they respawn, you gain no experience, and often end up using more &quot;elemental fuel&quot; than you regain) is negligible.The game is billed as an action/adventure. Adventure games are generally about two things - seeing the sights, and solving some puzzles. The sights are a mix of good and bad. While there's clearly a lot of geometry up on the screen, it's not really put to good effect. Textures are detailed close up, but muddy from the distance you'd normally look at them from. Poor level-of-detail control. The level design is also often pointless, and very easy to get lost in due to the repetitive nature of the levels.Azurik's cardinal and unforgivable sin, however, is that there is no logic to the game. The puzzles are simply to find the pieces of the elemental discs, and their respective powers, and use them where you're told to. There are a few puzzles that actually require some thought, but even then, they're more illogical and trial-and-error based than not. Had there been any indication of where you might look to solve your current problem, the game would have been worlds better.Alas, the lack of logic in the puzzles and level designs, the poor floaty controls, the repetitive and boring combat, and the atrocious save system (yes, there's a save anywhere cheat. It can also permanently ruin your game, forcing you to start all over again if you use it wrong) make Azurik a pass for all but the most hardcore adventure gamers. But the problem, then, is that the hardcore have seen games much better than this.

I'm a big fan of RPGs, especially those involving magic. I was disappointed with Nightcaster, though, and recommend this as a rent-first game for the XBox.First, to be fair, the good points. Nightcaster has a cool spell concept. You draw from four different types of spells, using a glowy floating orb to direct your attacks. There are different spells in each class - from fire and water, light and darkness. Enemies are resistant to some sorts of spells, vulnerable to others.The graphics are OK. A reasonable level of detail is found as you wander through countryside and towns in your quest to rid the world of evil.But the gameplay in general just isn't there. You're a young boy who is lured by a glowing orb into abandoning your parents and home (without even telling them) for MANY years to 'train' to defeat a future evil. When you're finally released, you find your village in flames and your parents dead. Your sympathetic orb goes, "Jeez, time to take revenge!" And despite those many years of training, the spells you cast are pretty feeble.The game has very much a Gauntlet-type feel, destroying monster generators and working through a linear path. However, the monsters are not threatening at all, and there's no multiplayer. The great fun of Gauntlet (a game I *love*) is the multiplayer mayhem and amazing party potential when you get some friends over. In comparison, Nightcaster is a solo trek through dungeon ... after dungeon ... after dungeon.In its defense, Nightcaster was one of the first XBox games out and maybe was rushed to meet the release date. Definitely a game to rent first before you buy.

You play as a voodoo doll, named &quot;Voodoo Vince&quot;, your mission is to rescue the vodoo priestess who got kidnapped (she is your owner). As a voodoo doll, you have power to inflict injury to your enemies by first causing injury to yourself (of course). you can perform special voodoo attacks when you collect enough magic orbs (from defeated enemies). It's just a standard platformer game once you get past the novelty. You can do your basic spin attack, jumps, grabbing onto ledges and floating. The graphics are nice and have a deformed look to it, adding to the wacky atmosphere of the game. The sound effects and music, were good, but very repetative. The controls were okay. The game gets difficult fast, and will give younger players a hard time. Since younger players are the target audience I think it was a mistake to make the game this hard. The game is also very short and very linear.Pros:+good graphics+good controls+voodoo doll powers+funnyCons:-very difficult gameplay-weak sound effects-repetative music-very short game-linear gameplay-difficult puzzles-nothing innovating-dark looking levels-awkward cameraThere are lots of better platformer games out there. Voodoo Vince is not one of them.

I don't understand why people would say that the Xbox wireless controller is the best, most ergonomically designed video game controller on the market.  It really isn't.  Number one, it uses batteries, so you constantly have to buy new batteries or use a recharging kit.  I tried looking online and conducting research to find out if there's a separate USB cable that could hook the controller up to the Xbox in order to make it wired, but I found no such thing.  If anybody knows of a cable that can do this, please comment about it below, but to the best of my knowledge, no such device exists.  I see a hook-up port of some type on the superior aspect of the controller, but that seems to be a slot for your headset.  As great as that convenience might be, I'd rather have that port be available as a cable hook-up for the controller.No such problem exists for the PS3 controller.  For the PS3, it doesn't have any batteries, and the wireless controller charges while it's plugged into the system.  Why couldn't the Xbox controller do the same thing?  It's mind boggling...Another drawback to the Xbox wireless controller is the battery pack itself:  do you know how hard it is to remove the batteries from it?  It's ridiculous!  It was so hard to take the original stock batteries out of it, and then I put in a set of rechargeable ones.  Those, too, were very hard to remove from the pack, to the point where I thought I had to break it in order to get them out.  Not too good!Speaking about the design of the controller, why do people say that it's more efficient and "better" than the PS3 controller?  I don't see how.  The PS3 controller has a more linear style to it, with the thumbsticks neatly arranged in a horizontal fashion, and the trigger buttons are appropriately labeled as L1/L2 and R1/R2.  The Xbox calls them LB/LT and RB/RT.  What the heck kind of designation system is that?  I get so confused when an action calls for using those buttons.  Giving them a number system is a lot more efficient.Overall, I strongly favor the PS3 controller over the Xbox one.
Failure.  Here's why1. No Franchise mode, I mean come on!  Franchise is everything, and is what killed this game.  No franchise = No real fun.  I probably would have gotten it if this hadn't been the case.2. The overall gameply.  According to everyone it's to easy, the annoucers are horrible, the players look stiff.  And is it just me, or is the stadium really dark?  So much more could have been done.  Better gameplay, graphics, and overall depth is how this game failed.What I did like about this game was the passing and shooting style.  The passes were cool and easy, and the shots looked awsome.  Unfortunantly, everything is dark, the rims dont look like rims, and the gameplay is easy to beat.  Trust me, I've played this game.Overall, this game just didn't live up to what it could have been.  But Microsoft already fixed the problem with the 2003 edition.  The game has a ton of dunks, fluid player animations, and a whopping 25 season franchise mode.  Sure, it's 60% more to pay, but it's either that, or this.  Go for the new and improved 2003 edition.  Either that, or go for NBA Live 2002 or NBA 2K2.  Thx!

Dull.  That coupled with jittery rendering, bad physics and horrendously monochromatic enviroments make this RPG rather annoying to play.  I was bored stiff within the first 10 minutes.  I  figured I'd give it an hour...yawn.The cut scenes are not animated (crude cartoon drawings made to look like they're being clever).  And talk about "loading"!  I thought Baldur's Gate had a lot, but this one wins the prize.  Sudeki beats the hell out of this game.Kids may like and eventually come to master the complex battle engine (with three concurrent modes of combat), but the lack of a 'femme fatale' playable/interactive character won't hold the adolescent mind very long.Worth the wait?  No.  Beautiful to look at?  No, unless all you've been playing lately is Quake.After all the hype I feel cheated.  I've been made to cough up 50 bucks for a crude psychology experiment.One last note:  why is voice talent in Western RPG's so bad?  Sudeki's 'talent' made you grind your teeth.  In the land of Fable, Jamaica apparently lies just off the coast.  Once again, annoying.

I loved Halo.  I even got my friends hooked and they bought XBox's just for Halo.  We stood in line to get this, and we are all dissapointed.  The weapons are watered down, the campaign is dark and dreary, and the multiplayer is filled with bugs and glitches.  On the bonus DVD, they keep saying over and over how they wish they had more time to do this or that.  It is an unfinished, and very unpolished game.  In multiplayer you can't just start a room with the map or game options that you want.  Bungie has a "playlist".  One is Team Slayer.  You can't control how many people play, what map you play on, or even what weapons you use.  One of the biggest gripes people have is that Bungie forces everyone to use the second weakest weapon in the game as their starting weapon.  This makes for a lot of weapon whoring and just frustration on the part of a LOT of gamers.  Not having a choice in what I want to play is a major downfall of this game.  I don't see it having the legs that Halo had.

Want a boring experience with clumsy play control? Then pick this poor excuse for a killer app up. You will appreciate Mario and Sonic more, but that still won't get you your money back.

Since its not fair to give a review on hype and promises alone, I'm going to give you the review first and then list the promises that were made which is why I gave fable such a low rating.Sound: The game has wonderful sound to it with the npc voices and even the fighting music and traveling a music. Its not the greatest but it did deliver when and where it was needed.Graphics: I am not one to base rpg's on graphics, I can do well with sprites and old school NES and SNES graphics. To me graphics are not what make an rpg an rpg, its all about the story and character development. Graphics are eyecandy when making an rpg. With that said, this game delivers in all areas, your character is wonderfully done (I don't know technical terms with graphics so bare with me), the towns and npc's are amazing and beautiful, the magic and weapon designs are amazing and an treat for the eye. Unfortunately, with the trees and grass and the world looking amazing, you can't run off the beaten path and enjoy it.Story: I don't give spoilers away and I won't here. I'm sorry to say that the story is lacking in all departments and when it finally starts picking up its the end of the game. I will give them this though, the storyline to the sister in the game-absolutely wonderful, too bad it wasn't the main characters story. Also, the game can be finished and all side-quests done in under 10 hours, I know this because I beat it the day I got it.Combat System: Two words- Absolutely Amazing, I have played tons of rpg's and by far this one I enjoyed the most. Its actually what kept me playing the game and beating it. I don't think I would've finished the game if the combat sucked. I haven't played the game since its actual release years ago and it just got put up on the shelf and forgotten about.You do get to have different hairstyles, tatoos, gotees and mustaches as well as physical scars but it gets old after awhile and you start not to care.With all that being said, it doesn't sound like a bad game and how is it that I give it a bad review. Well I'll explain.....I'll start off with promises that Peter Molyneux promised for the game and the absolute linear game that I am still mad about.....Promised:1. A full world to roam around and explore2. Aging process3. Killing kids and kids dressing up like you when you enter towns if you are good.4. Being able to turn a town into a ghost town5. Being able to be good during the day and evil during the night6. Kill a band of thieves for a town and return to the town and they hate you because a more evil band threatens them7. Plant an acorn and return to see it become a tree8. Having a wife and kids and the kid will either love you or hate you-if the kid hates you, the kid will try and kill you9. Body developments depending on wether you use magic or weaponsWhat did you actually get:1. A very linear game that doesn't let you go off the beaten path, no exploration required. A side note: My favorite video game magazine ever, Play, reviewed this game and said "It's the most non-linear game I've ever played". I don't think I got the same copy that reviewer got and I still love my Play magazine and that has been one of the few reviews I've disagreed with them on.2. Okay, my character ages, but what about everyone else-after it said two weeks in the game my character was 80 something which made me older than my mom in the game before.....3. Killing kids- I guess thats bad in a video game...so you can't. The only town that has kids is protected to where you can't draw your weapon and do anything. Also, I think only one or two kids actually "try" to dress like you but most people didn't notice. I did.4. Yes, you can wipe out a town full of all the people, however, you'll fight guards for hours until you leave the town and if you return the guards are waiting for you and "guarding" a town with noone in it.5. Without being able to explore the world you can not be good during the day and bad during the night. There was supposed to be sheep or whatever like that and at night you could go wipe out the flock and if you did enough damage it would force some of the townspeople to leave and turn the town into a ghost town6. There is only one band of thieves and they are on the "linear" path and when you kill them, no other band moves in to take the place.7. You can't plant anything8. You can have a wife and no kids. Also, you can only be with one woman in one town so if you want to have another woman you need to go to a different town. I know it is stupid to try to have 2 wives in the same village but why not try?9. Try and fight without using a sword and only using magic, its nearly impossible so you end up using a sword and your body starts gettin huge and you end up not using magic that much.So the game I was looking forward to and the game I actually got were two seperate games. I first heard about Fable, back when it was called Project Ego, almost a year before the realease of the xbox which released 3 years later after the xbox came out.Thats why this game only gets a very dissapointing 2 out of 5. If you've never heard of the game before, you will very much enjoy it, however, if you're like me you will definately want to skip this one...
Since its not fair to give a review on hype and promises alone, I'm going to give you the review first and then list the promises that were made which is why I gave fable such a low rating.Sound: The game has wonderful sound to it with the npc voices and even the fighting music and traveling a music. Its not the greatest but it did deliver when and where it was needed.Graphics: I am not one to base rpg's on graphics, I can do well with sprites and old school NES and SNES graphics.

So today's game market is pretty well if not over saturated with strategy games. With this being the case it makes sense that developers of the new comers learn from and improve based on titles that have been on the shelves. Obviously this logic doesn't follow through in the real world, enter Kingdom Under Fire.Now although some of the sounds of battle are pretty well done, KUF leaves a generic after taste. swords clash with as much enthusiasm as a high school thespian take on Hamlet. Horses, arrows, trampling feet, all sound generic and uninspired. The final death blow to the sound quality comes from the voice acting. Dialogue feels cheap and meaningless between yawn inspiring battle charges and filler buster comments among characters.The graphics have also suffered. Although character models look good form long range, animations and detail look childish at a closer glance. I simply can't say enough bad things about the animation. One such example is the way characters run through trees and obstacles, it looks more like they're running in place while the world moves around and shifts out of their way. Usually poor voice acting and graphics go hand in hand and KUF is no exception. Characters don't even speak their lines. Instead the programmers decided to have the characters constantly "chew gum"  while the voice track is played. Even after they speak  the characters continue to do the chewing motion-is this level of programing really acceptable with the capabilities of the XBOX?Gameplay quickly becomes boring no matter what the mission is. Battles mean mashing your troops into enemy troops with the ocassional support of varying soldier types. This does add a level of tactics to the game but not enough to compete-or even step in the same field as other strategy titles. The core of all battles is getting your character in the thick of the melee. The quickest and most efficient way to end these battles is by finding the commander of the enemy forces and quickly taking them out. Its a good idea but translates into a random chance on the battlefield as the commanders always look like the other enemies on the screen. You'll be lucky if you find them.With everything said, Kingdom Under Fire is a title that adds no ambition to the RTS genre. All aspects of the game range from bland to mediocre and onward to generic. This title is obviously an attempt by programmers who love RTS' to get a foot hold on the genre; the reallity is that they should have stayed out or developed a more valiant effort. For those with computers running at a good  ability, there is an endless sea of RTS games. Sadly, Kingdom Under Fire throws in the towel to even the classics from the past decade. If you're curious, rent it. Otherwise pass it by on your way to a Blizzard or Sierra title.

the only conclusion that i can come to is that some of the rave reviews of this game were written by those who have a vested interest in you buying Brute Force.  this game is nothing special.  i swear.the graphics are ok.  they're not at the level of Halo, Splinter Cell, or Orta (or Ghost Recon, or Tides of War, or... ok, most x-box games).  i would say that this game looked pretty good if it was on the PS2 (which isn't really saying much).  the environments are kinda bland and the particle effects (gun fire, explosions, items shattering, etc.) are barely there.  the only time i thought the game looked good was using the rifle zoom and during the intro to each level.  the character movement is smooth, but they look like knuckleheads and the enemies are just goofy. you've seen better, much better.the gameplay is about as straightforward as it gets.  it's a third-person shooter so the rules are simple = if it moves, shoot it.  the path before you is totally linear, which means you'll be running along from point A to point B to point C without being able to deviate and explore the environment (which looks weak, so i guess that's not so bad).  you have objectives to complete, but those are to either to reach a checkpoint or blow something up.  sound familiar?all four characters have special abilities, but they only use them when you're in control of the character.  so, if you're playing as the guy who gets extra adrenaline to kick some tail (which is the lizard-looking creature), the character that can cloak herself to sneak around is getting shot up because you have to switch to her to use the invisibility cloak.... and when you switch, the lizard guy will stop using his boosted strength to kill because you switched characters.  in other words, the special abilities are ok when you're facing only a few enemies, but when attacked by many, they become useless.  this became one of my biggest issues with the game because the special abilities could have been much more useful.another thing that drove me nuts was that the position of the character on the screen (the one you're controlling) is all wrong.  if you're shooting at someone above or below you, the camera angle is ok.... but if the enemy is straight ahead?  you character's body gets in the way and you can't see what's coming.  sometimes you have to run to the left or right just to see what's in front of you = poor game design.the rest of the game is about as mediocre as what's already been mentioned.  the weapons fire and voice acting are ok.  the weapons offered are nothing new (the rifle zoom and targeting reticule are taken directly from Halo).  nothing about this game is really inspiring and i found myself wanting to sell it about half way through as nothing new was coming along....

I loved the Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee and the Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus games!  The whole concept of puzzle solving raised above everything else, the idea that there is no life bar ("Do, or do not", there is no "I barely made it through, but I only lost half my life"), it's totally gutted from the game!  Argh!  Who took a great idea, an awesome concept, and pissed it all away by making it like every other game out there?!Sure, they kept the same great world, with those great characters, and the same humor, but what happened to the fundamental elements that made Oddworld stand apart from all the other games?!  Now it's more like the Ratchet & Clank, the Jax & Daxter, or the Sly Cooper games (but it's not as good as Ratchet & Clank or Sly Cooper).  What happened to the challenging puzzle solving play concepts that made the previous Oddworld games so great?!Whoever made the decision to be more like other games on the market, to stop being their own different and original game line, really screwed the pooch on this one.  This new direction in the Oddworld games makes it nothing more than one of many generic games in an over saturated genre.  It's really sad to see the great succession of Abe's Oddworld games come to this.I played this as far as I could maintain interest in it, I really wanted to see more of the world, the humor, and the clips with the Glukkons (bad guys), but the game was just lacking.  I found myself just running through areas, while just trying to avoid taking too much damage, and not really focusing on real game play.  But that was the problem: There was a lack of that challenging game play that made the Oddworld series so great.And the camera and controls were irritating.I'm through with this game: for what it is, it isn't worth playing just to try to see the interesting clips and humor that might be in there.  I might see what the next Oddworld game looks like, but if it's like this one (Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee) then I'm done with anything new from Oddworld.I am really disappointed.

Im being honest here, i dont understand how this game got good reviews here ... I didnt like this game as much as I thought I would.The value of the Cons outweigh the value of the Pros tremendously.The Pros that were enjoyable were the awesome graphics, the system of advancement is mature and the ability to race with your own music.The problem is the major cons. While there are stylish things in the game, the GAMEPLAY (TOTALLY) [is bad]. It feels like I'm driving a turtle, The cars dont go fast at all. I thought something must be wrong as I couldnt believe how slow the cars go at top speed. It's so slow it's almost silly.and I agree about the controlling the cars as some others said, its a nuisance. I mean it shouldnt be so ridiculous. I just want to race, go fast and have fun. If you played Splashdown (awesome gameplay) you will know what I mean.The cars don't race smoothly and it isnt practical for a game. For example, you cant turn with even medium speed. You have to let go of the gas way ahead and brake completely (almost coming to a full stop) when turning.The bottom line is that yes there are cool things about the game but nothing is more important than the gameplay and it totally [bad]. As a note, I rented this game and i certainly wouldn't buy it.If you want to know what i mean by awesome gameplay for racing see "Splashdown". The engineers did an awesome job, somehow they've combined difficulty with fun and awesome speed. I completed the career and have played it so many times and I can play it all day because the racing itself is just pure fun. That's how a race game should be unlike Project Gotham.I would've gave the game a 1 but I gave it a 2 only for cool graphics, and music support.
