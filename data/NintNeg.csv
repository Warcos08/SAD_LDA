4,Nintendo,1,this is the stuppidiest game i've ever played. I advise everyone not to play it or buy it. It really sucked.,1080 BORING!
9,Nintendo,1,"this game is the hardest game ive ever played, and that takes away the fun. also graphics very poor even for nintendo 64 cannot even recommend for people i dislike dont waste your time or money worst n64 game ever",too hard not fun
67,Nintendo,1,mario kart is not fun there is no secret characthers or secret places[i think]. I tried the game for an hour and was completly bored now i don't like racing games. The producers should have tried a little harder on this game i was completly unsatified.,mario crash and burns
72,Nintendo,1,"I have the wii version and is HORRIBLE. JUST LIKE YOU HIT AN OPPONENT WITH A SHELL, PASS, AND WITH NO ITEM, THE CPU BOOSTS WAY AHAED. HORRIBLE",WORST
102,Nintendo,1,"Seriously, this ranks up with some of the worst games I have ever played. It is a complete insult to anyone who respects the RPG genre as this is nothing more than a linear, cutesy, puzzle game. You run around playing a little harmonica by pressing certain buttons in certain orders and the rest of the time you are moving boxes around, jumping from platform to platform, and killing enemies (with an awful targeting system) that respawn as soon as you leave the room.I can guarantee that about 95% of all the 4 and 5 star votes are coming from children under the age of 15 as this is the type of game that would appeal to them. But if you are an older, more experienced gamer do yourself a favor and steer clear from this hideous example of a good title gone bad.If you'll excuse me I am going to balance out my wobbly kitcken table with the cartridge.",The biggest waste of money ever
137,Nintendo,1,"Seriously, it's one of the worst games ever! Terrible graphics, especially compared to the PS Triple's, no voice acting, boring puzzles, and above all, it stars a little fruity fairy boy who wears green panties and never hits on any of the babes in this game. Plus why is the main villian black? That's racist!For a good Zelda game, I recommend Link: The Faces of Evil, The Wand of Gamelon, or Zelda's Adventure.",Why does everyone like this?
171,Nintendo,1,"There's many that love this so-called masterpiece, but the only thing I like about this boring/repetitive game is the great soundtrack. Sticking to the superior original.",Pro: Soundtrack Cons: What isn't a pro
305,Nintendo,1,"Even when it first came out I tried out this game but could not get into it and I hate the n64 old style 3d graphics where the camera angle ends up getting you killed every five seconds, espessially in pits.  Of all the Mario games to date including the amazing Wii titles except for Super Mario Wii this has to be the worst Mario game for me since Mario Nes.  The graphics are terrible, the music is annoying and it's just boaring.",Never liked it.
