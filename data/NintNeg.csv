67,Nintendo,1,mario kart is not fun there is no secret characthers or secret places[i think]. I tried the game for an hour and was completly bored now i don't like racing games. The producers should have tried a little harder on this game i was completly unsatified.,mario crash and burns
72,Nintendo,1,"I have the wii version and is HORRIBLE. JUST LIKE YOU HIT AN OPPONENT WITH A SHELL, PASS, AND WITH NO ITEM, THE CPU BOOSTS WAY AHAED. HORRIBLE",WORST
97,Nintendo,2,"Every once in a while I experience a piece of entertainment that is *so* overrated it's hard to believe I'm even living on the same planet as those that actually believe this is supposed to be the best. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is that very piece of overrated entertainment. Talk about a video game that not only doesn't live up to the hype (not even close) but it doesn't do a darn thing to impress me even *if* I were to ignore all the exaggerated hype. This is a serious letdown of a video game. But again, please understand I'm not from the same planet as those that enjoy this game. I care about gameplay and replay value more than anything else. Apparently most Zelda fans believe puzzle-based dungeons and soulless overworlds are what defines the Zelda series.One thing that positively stinks is that the land of Hyrule, despite being presented as beautiful (and realistic- don't tell me Nintendo wasn't riding the 3D high in 1998 and going for realism here) it's basically a gigantic piece of nothingness. Simply a means of getting from one area to another. A large, colorless empty field that Link either runs or rides his horse across. Nothing magical, medieval or interesting about *any* of this. It feels too much like taking a typical walk across the field beside my house. Going into this game after a Link to the Past, you'll be scratching your head wondering what happened to the huge variety of overworld enemies, pretty and colorful environments and enticing obstacles. Remember all those trees, rocks, grass and water sections from Link to the Past? Remember how rich and vibrant they looked? Ha, nothing nearly as diverse is featured in this bland and inferior overworld. Oh sure the monsters come out at night (in predictable spots) but that's it. As far as I can see, only one monster actually comes out (named Stalchild). Terribly lacking. The trees are spaced apart in a way that feels lacking too.The dungeons is where this game severely misses the mark to such an extent that it's almost unfathomable to believe Nintendo thought releasing the game the way it is was enough to be sufficient. Again, where ARE all the enemies? Why am I roaming through temple rooms that are way too big for their own good? Are high ceilings and deep pits supposed to justify the lack of enemies because the tradeoff is that it feels like I'm really inside a castle now? Give me a break guys. The rooms are so big they basically have no life whatever. Instead of being loaded with enemies around every corner, these castles are alarmingly empty, lifeless and unacceptable. But... that's apparently okay, because Ocarina of Time is the first 3D Zelda game so its legendary influence and innovation makes it leaps and bounds above the sequels, right? Not in my world baby. The games following Ocarina of Time perfected the Zelda formula way more effectively. Wind Waker and Skyward Sword leaves this dated mess in the dust.While normally I don't care about graphics in a video game, you gotta admit that bright vibrant colors really make the epic heroic adventurous theme of the Zelda series more engrossing. This is just... gross. Only the realistic-looking (flawed) overworld is a sight to behold (which of course now looks significantly better in Twilight Princess). Clearly the effort involved in designing the dungeons isn't much to admire. I don't really mind the occasional choppiness concerning the edges of buildings, trees or other objects that are all part of the Nintendo 64's datedness. Sometimes these unintentional features can be quite charming or, at the very least, forgiving. What I DO mind however is when these features are all over the place to the point of being a distraction, or having a game entirely too long so we're forced to persevere these issues time and time again. In other words I'd be willing to forgive this particular shortcoming if the game made up for the choppy/uninspiring graphics in other areas. Sadly, it doesn't. This isn't even much of an issue compared to the other complaints I have (which I'll mention below- keep reading). These graphics -especially the ones in the dungeons- resemble the ones found in the ruins of Mega Men Legends and the walls of the Quake series. The graphics in Link to the Past are unique and cannot be compared to any other game.Let's discuss the dungeons, shall we? Despite being ridiculously and needlessly large with boring surroundings, most of them have such a small and uninteresting variety of enemies that it's almost a chore going through one generic room after another. Ocarina of Time shows the makings of early 3D development at its most obvious- the platforms are predictable square structures that requires the player to spend most of his or her time lining up Link in order to make proper jumps by turning the camera until Link is positioned enough to reach the platform directly ahead. When you combine the constant requirement of having to change camera angles with having to position Link correctly all for the purpose of being able to see what you're doing and where you're going, it's enough to make you think you're playing with string puppets. Again, early 3D design flaws and datedness.The storytelling is really basic and predictable. It's never elaborate like in Wind Waker or Skyward Sword. It's mainly about rescuing or saving these mountainous cave creatures called Goron's for the first half, and going back and forth from the past to the present in the second half. This is a really uninteresting way of time travelling that feels almost nonexistent due to being so poorly and unsatisfyingly implemented. It doesn't even feel or look like you're going 7 years into the future as Link's appearance is supposed to be that of an older person but he doesn't appear to be much different from his younger self. Oh sure he's slightly bigger as an adult and slightly smaller as a kid but it's very subtle. The music is the one area where the game succeeds quite amazingly however. All the theme songs are not only appropriate for the environments, but melodic and memorable. Several dungeon themes are well-made and believably chilling and haunting. The right ingredients were definitely put into the music-making aspect of the game. The Hyrule overworld theme is enjoyable too and won't get on your nerves despite all the time you will undoubtedly spend there.The dungeons are either incredibly simplistic with strategies that involve the overbearingly dull and overused crate-pushing to open up portals or switches, or hopelessly generic ""I'm stuck in a maze and I can't get out"" frustration that is an inconvenient trademark of early 3D game design. But... these aren't any ordinary mazes. These are mazes where your surroundings look identical around every turn, hence the flawed early 3D game design. A cheap way of making a maze seem more difficult than it has to be, or in other words, needlessly difficult chores instead of exciting castle exploration which is what made the 2D Zelda's so memorable. Sometimes you have to light torches with arrows or by other means, and quite often you have to collect 5 silver rupees to activate a switch/open a door. Collecting these silver rupees is WAY too similar to Super Mario 64 with the red coins. The Lost Woods is a tunnel-infested maze with no personality whatsoever. The Lost Woods -if you plan on getting everything the game has to offer- will most definitely be the source of endless frustration.The enemies, or rather, what little enemies you will stumble upon on your ""adventure"" through the temples, is probably the most aggravating part of the entire game. These dungeons are sorely in need of something to spice them up and make them pleasurable. You will often go 3 or 4 rooms at a time without seeing a single enemy. Why even have a sword? In the 2D games the idea was simple- just load or overload the rooms with a variety of enemies and, guess what? *Now* the dungeons are exciting. A genius idea really. Here? In Ocarina of Time? It's all about atmosphere. It's all about featuring as little opposing danger as possible so you can absorb what was once Nintendo's most recent creation back in 1998. But... Nintendo forgot to take into account that technology will inevitably advance and a game relying on atmosphere above everything else will eventually suffer and become inferior one day. What was once a brand new puppy in 1998 is now a tired old dog thanks to the surroundings being boring and incredibly basic in their design. Video game technology is destined to advance making a game like this completely forgettable. That's exactly what has happened with Ocarina of Time- it hasn't stood the test of time.Do you really think those poorly animated mechanical blue tektite spiders in the water dungon are worthy of a Zelda game? Seriously? Their animations are so stiff due to the Nintendo 64's limitations as a console that it's unbearable to deal with them and laughable at the way they lunge towards Link. But even then, *most* dungeon enemies fall way short of acceptable. Big Skulltula is a laughably bland attempt at being dangerous- it's more like a nuisance when one of these comes down out of nowhere while you're running around. The spikes that roll around are incredibly basic and uninteresting. Somehow *all* the enemies manage to never once be memorable. Ever! Ocarina of Time has dated horrendously, seriously. Wolfos are unintetionally funny with their choppy movements and the dated howling sounds they make, Red Bubble is basically the same thing as Big Skulltula but on fire, and Gibdos are boring. The ReDead's let out a hilarious scream that freezes Link in place which is inconvenient when you're trying to get up the ladder right in front of you and even more inconvenient when you're stuck in a room with two of them. Mummies are poorly designed since all you have to do is hookshot them, run behind them, and slice them with your sword. To be fair, some enemies are cool such as Deku Baba where it's best to snap its vine with the sword for an instant kill- creatively well done there. The Deku Scrub where you can block or sword swipe its shooting seeds with the shield and ricochet the seeds back at them is neat. And the Lizalfos and Dinalfos basically serve as mini bosses due to being somewhat harder and more sophisticated than the other ordinary enemies.The game overall has a shortage of rupees. They're really not that important which is odd. This is the first Zelda game I've ever played where rupees feel more like an afterthought. Not something to take real seriously. If you don't feel like collecting them, then don't- no harm done. The bosses are alright except for the irritating one in the water dungeon. You have to repeatedly hookshot him while standing next to the platform. It takes FOREVER (and no, this boss is *nowhere* as fun as the water dungeon in Link to the Past in case you're wondering). The hookshot is used MORE than the sword throughout the game because it serves as an effective weapon quite often. The hookshot is a highly recommended weapon to use in a variety of situations, but especially important when collecting these things called gold skulltulas. After you collect 10 gold skulltula tokens, you get a beneficial reward. You can only collect them after defeating the gold skulltula enemy (usually found on walls). I admit I love the witches you face in the Spirit Temple. While the temple itself is really short and boring, it's probably worth going through it so you can face the two witches that make for a rather entertaining boss fight. You have to use your shield to reflect shots at the *other* witch, and it's really fun and creative. The hookshot's basically a required item to properly deal with hard-shelled or spiked enemies in the dungeons and it's annoying that it's used WAY more frequently than the sword throughout the game. Due to how much precision is required to use the hookshot, using this item becomes a very tedious chore after a while (especially if you keep missing your target) and it slows down the pace of the game by a lot.If you haven't noticed yet, the water dungeon in Ocarina of Time is just abominable. I bring it up often to remind people how terrible a dungeon can be in every possible way. Also, the worst influence ever occurs here- the importance of playing the ocarina musical instrument for a variety of reasons (mostly for warping from one place to another). Nintendo really overdid this aspect of the game by implementing the ocarina WAY too many darn times. It's overdone. Just hurry up and play the darn song and move on for goodness sake. Don't make it so you have to play the ocarina up to 50 times, if not more. I never really counted how many times I used it. It was a lot. It severely drags the gameplay, atmosphere and excitement down and immediately drags the game to a screeching halt having to frequently stop and play these songs on the ocarina. Watching Link stand around and play the instrument is the fruitiest thing I've ever seen. No wonder people think Nintendo makes nothing but kids games these days. This game is partly responsible for that belief due to its influence.Ganon's castle is supposed to be exhilarating and suspenseful. It's supposed to be filled with dangerous traps, tricky puzzles and enemies all over the place. But... the one in Ocarina of Time falls way short of being presentable by normal Legend of Zelda standards. Instead the castle is dominated with mini quests where you have to go through 6 trials to dispel the main barrier. The problem is that each trial contains really simple and short rooms where you only spend a couple minutes in each one performing the same tasks that you already had to do in the previous dungeons such as collecting 5 silver rupees. This is the complete opposite of being overwhelmingly threatening. Another bonus point for Link to the Past. Oh and the Ganon fight? His strategy is stolen from Agahnim's battle from Link to the Past but takes SEVERAL more minutes to bring down. Remember how you fought Agahnim? Yup, same exact strategy but in a 3D world. Sigh. The second part of the Ganon fight (after a looooong and tedious time-based departure from the top of a castle) is to shoot arrows at Ganon and hit his glowing behind several times. It's really easy, all of it. However fighting him in one of the early dungeons (Forest Temple) is actually one of the most memorable in the entire Zelda series. This is because Ganon rides a horse in and out of these picture frames hanging on the wall making for a VERY unique graphics effect and perhaps an original concept. Reminds me of a Harry Potter movie.A few other complaints. Fishing is sort of fun but nothing really noteworthy. It's better than most fishing games I've played in other games I admit. Expect to be sitting and fishing a while in order to get the heart piece however. Most heart pieces are pretty challenging to acquire and take some serious effort to get most of them. That's a rare compliment I can give. Some of the other mini games such as riding a horse and shooting targets is pretty fun. I don't really like that part in the desert where you have to follow a ghost through a dust storm. If you fall behind even a *little* bit you'll lose. Performing this same ghost-chasing task earlier in the game in order to obtain the hookshot is more exciting since you're dodging fireballs. The other task earlier on in the game in the Ice Cavern that involves throwing blue fire over red fire is really overlong and entirely puzzle-based. Having to do this once or twice would have been suitable- not 15-20 times. This particular place is a victim of platforms that are basic and uninteresting.Basically, when compared to the 2D games, Ocarina of Time only feels like half a game due to the dramatic change of turning the Zelda series into 3D but only giving us a small portion of what's available in Link to the Past. As a result the game feels incomplete on too many occasions. It's because the Nintendo 64 is a limited console that's really only able to handle so much. Ocarina of Time comes up way short. Even the first couple hours are disappointing since it takes forever to actually get going. Avoiding being detected by guards isn't fun after the first time. Oh and speaking of avoiding detection- this game actually has a Metal Gear Solid stealth-style mission later on where you have to free these imprisoned carpenter people. The stealth is so underutilized and simplistic that this is the second biggest chore in the game next to the water dungeon. Equally annoying is upon freeing the 4 carpenters, these red sword-swinging enemies appear on screen. The SAME EXACT ENEMY 4 times in a row with *no* differences between any of them. At first these battles seem hard until you realize all you really have to do is lunge your sword directly at them about 5 times, and they fall over and die.Reading text and having boring discussions with Zelda, trees and other semi-interesting characters doesn't get the job done either. Ganon even seems significantly less threatening than usual (that one conversation with Zelda and Link with Ganon patrolling the hallways nearby in Hyrule Castle comes to mind here). I will admit that some of the flame-covered cutscenes involving Ganon riding his horse is very intimidating. The cutscene outside the bridge of Hyrule Castle comes to mind here. Otherwise, Ganon's presented uninterestingly. You're *supposed* to get a feeling of hopelessness that Ganon is going to take over the world and wipe the people out but... due to a culmination of the above mentioned problems, Ganon being a ruthless villain doesn't ever materialize (at least, he's not as scary as he *should* be).Recognize Ocarina of Time for making the 3D Zelda series exist. That's fair. It allowed Wind Waker to eventually be created which in turn made the 3D Zelda formula better starting from that game until now. By 2003 Nintendo was working with the technologically superior Gamecube console which allowed the Zelda series to be fully realized in all major categories (gameplay, graphics, replay value and excitement). I say avoid Ocarina of Time but hey, nobody will listen or agree with me anyway so carry on and have a wonderful day!",a 2-star rating- I seriously can't give it a higher star
102,Nintendo,1,"Seriously, this ranks up with some of the worst games I have ever played. It is a complete insult to anyone who respects the RPG genre as this is nothing more than a linear, cutesy, puzzle game. You run around playing a little harmonica by pressing certain buttons in certain orders and the rest of the time you are moving boxes around, jumping from platform to platform, and killing enemies (with an awful targeting system) that respawn as soon as you leave the room.I can guarantee that about 95% of all the 4 and 5 star votes are coming from children under the age of 15 as this is the type of game that would appeal to them. But if you are an older, more experienced gamer do yourself a favor and steer clear from this hideous example of a good title gone bad.If you'll excuse me I am going to balance out my wobbly kitcken table with the cartridge.",The biggest waste of money ever
137,Nintendo,1,"Seriously, it's one of the worst games ever! Terrible graphics, especially compared to the PS Triple's, no voice acting, boring puzzles, and above all, it stars a little fruity fairy boy who wears green panties and never hits on any of the babes in this game. Plus why is the main villian black? That's racist!For a good Zelda game, I recommend Link: The Faces of Evil, The Wand of Gamelon, or Zelda's Adventure.",Why does everyone like this?
171,Nintendo,1,"There's many that love this so-called masterpiece, but the only thing I like about this boring/repetitive game is the great soundtrack. Sticking to the superior original.",Pro: Soundtrack Cons: What isn't a pro
188,Nintendo,2,"Miyamoto slacked off on this one.1.This is certainly not the best game ever. Not even the best game on Nintendo 64. Super Mario 64, and Perfect Dark both stomp this game into submission.2.This is not a role-playing game. Role-playing games have a lot of text and character involvement. This game has a script that is about two pages long, maybe less. What you say or do in this game really has no effect on the games out come.3.This is not the best Zelda game. The Legend Of Zelda, Links Awakening, and A Link To The Past are all much better games, especially for their time.4.This game is not 256 Mega Bytes. It is actually 256 Mega Bits, which is equal to 32 Mega Bytes. So sorry the game isn't nearly the size of a 650/700 Mega Byte CD-ROM.5.The game has no replay value, I played through it once, then about a year later, I attempted playing through it again, I couldn't bare it, the game is just too boring. I played through Final Fantasy VII and VIII twice each, and those took alot longer than this to finish, they were both great both times through.I loved the good old Zelda games but this just doesn't deserve the Zelda name, lets just hope that Zelda on the Game Cube doesn't turn out the same way.","Best game ever? Sure, and Laetitia Casta is my girlfriend."
228,Nintendo,2,"Banjo-Kazooie is a strange platformer, but ultimately misses the mark in all key areas of being entertaining.  It tries to be funny without actually being exciting to play.  All the attention on humor and yet, the game itself is hardly ever fun.  This means children would probaly be able to overlook the games flaws and focus on the humor, which I'm sure was Nintendo's intentions- to market the game for kids and assume they wouldn't be able to detect the lousy game design.  I guess the Nintendo 64 struggling to make a profit at the time meant Nintendo had to do absolutely anything to try and get *any* type of crowd interested in their products despite the poor quality we're forced to persevere, so that explains Banjo Kazooie's existence.Anyway, Banjo-Kazooie is basically nothing but an item-collecting quest with graphics that are admittedly prettier and just better than 90% of the stuff the N64 was pumping out at the time.  The waters, grassy lands, mountains... everything is a beautiful sight to behold with crystal clear authentically pleasing environments.  But seriously, why am I basically doing nothing but walking around collecting items the entire time?  If you think ""That's what ALL platformers do!"" guess again: many of them focus on exciting enemy variety, diverse surroundings and a gradual increase in challenge which this game sorely lacks.  The only challenge is to avoid falling from high narrow platforms while collecting musical notes- these are dirty tricks and artificial challenges.  I found sharks you have to swim away from, crabs you can stomp on top of, and weird gigantic green enemies that come out of walls while you're trying to make your way across high paths without falling.  These enemies only appear like 10% of the time- the rest of your surroundings aren't very threatening.Let's see all the things you have to collect.  Honeycomb pieces, jiggy pieces (mandatory to open entrances to new locations and you need to obtain a certain number of them per world), 100 musical notes which is a total ripoff of Super Mario 64 with the 100 coins needed to get a star, mumbo tokens used to cast spells, and jinjo tokens used to win vehicle parts.  You can turn into animals and insects which is somewhat satisfying for the sake of seeing the occasional brief moments of diversity, but otherwise nothing to get really excited about.  Often you have to climb trees to reach the items on top and it gets boring after a while, believe me.Oh and the game is a victim of underwater tragedies- you're constantly adjusting the camera for a more appropriate angle but finding that it's much harder than it needs to be.  I will never understand why Nintendo refuses to fix water portions in 3D platform gaming.  It's mind-boggling.  They didn't even fix them in Super Mario Galaxy 2, a game released a good 10 years after Banjo-Kazooie.  The characters are all forgettable, including the ponytail-sporting female bear and Banjo himself.  Kazooie the bird is probably the only tolerable one of the bunch.Whereas the Mario series can be enjoyed by kids and adults respectively, Banjo-Kazooie is certainly intended solely for children and no other age group.  It's too shallow of a game overall to satisfy adult gamers.  Banjo-Kazooie is like walking into the nicest looking restaurant in town and everything is great except for one thing- you get a small quantity of food so you ask yourself ""Is it worth my time to return here again?""",banjo kapooie
255,Nintendo,2,Not one of the best games. I would have rather played Mario just once. I only play it for about two minutes. I fall asleep afterward.,Alright
279,Nintendo,2,"I recently tried playing this game, and by this point, my N64 is lucky it didn't get chucked out the window. The first few passes through the first few stages were fine, and pretty fun, but the rest of the game ends up being one long, annoying, tedious, impossible, and frustrating chore.To start off, the control just isn't good enough to pull off HALF the things you need to do in this game. There are instances where you must execute specific jumps to get you from point A to point B, but half the time, the controller is non-responsive. Especially when it comes to levels that put you high up, this usually means falling...over and OVER again!To add to this annoyance is the fact that there are no check points. If a level requires you to go to the top of a mountain, and you spend half an hour just getting up there and then you fall, you have to climb the whole thing ALL OVER AGAIN! So if you're like me, and find your self wondering off cliffs every other try because of the awful camera work, you will be playing the same stages over and over with no payoff but one big headache!Now let's talk about the camera. Throughout most of the game, I found my self fighting IT more than I fought Bowser. It's simply impossible to judge distances based on where the camera is facing at any given time. Pressing the C buttons will move it around, but you have to keep perfectly still in order to avoid suddenly gong sideways or backwards. If you are in a stage where there is a time limit or a complicated jump, this can be particularly fatal.Adding to this frustration is the fact that it is incredibly easy to over or under jump! This wouldn't be as much of a problem if it weren't for all the levels which require you to get to ""the top"" of things. Again, if you fall once, that's it, you start all over again. If the game designers weren't going to give you any continue points in these levels, why-o-why did they make it SO FRIGGIN' EASY FOR YOU TO FALL!!!???There are plenty of levels and stages in this game, and lots to do in all of them. But by the time I cleared one stage, I really questioned whether or not I wanted to even GO to the next. Finally, after reaching a mere 52 stars, my answer is no.So that's my two cents on this game, I can't beat it, I don't want to beat it. I'd rather go to a Morrissey concert with Kathy Griffin as the opening act than try to play it again. It would me MUCH less annoying than this game!",The Most Frustrating Thing ON EARTH!!!
285,Nintendo,2,"I'm pretty sick and tired of people calling Super Mario 64 a classic.  It's not.  Just because it's significant and influential in helping pave the way for future Mario titles doesn't mean Super Mario 64 is deserving of its classic status, or that it's any fun to actually play.  Super Mario Galaxy came along and pretty much improved every single aspect of Super Mario 64 so you basically no longer have to play this game other than to get a dated taste of mid 90's gaming history.  The only other possible reason someone would play Super Mario 64 is because they desperately seek open world exploration, and this is basically the only Mario platformer that can at least attempt to satisfy gamers with that particular appetite.  Not that I personally believe the game succeeds at the exploring aspect either.The biggest problem is that so much of the land you explore consists of emptiness.  Oh sure you'll see trees, ramps, castles, buildings, enemies such as goombas, chain chomps, badly and laughably animated thwomps lifting up and slamming down, pokeys, rolling boulders, and other things that have become a trademark of the Mario series, but the amount of items to find and collect is *extremely* limited to coins (both yellow and red ones) and the occasional power-up that enables Mario to either fly (which admittedly is pretty fun) or obtain the incredibly boring metal cap that makes Mario invincible.  An alternative to the starman perhaps, with lousy side effects (Mario can't jump as high or far while wearing the metal cap).When you're not experiencing the endless disappointment that is running across empty and boring lands and basically doing nothing but wasting time, you're jumping across a series of unspectacular and very ordinary-presented platforms over and *over* again.  This stuff seriously resembles a beginners course for developing platforms.  It's extremely basic game design.  The platforms are generic square-shaped tiles for you to jump across that quite often are all the same exact size.  It gets monotonous almost immediately.  Only unreasonable Nintendo fans would eat this stuff up, seriously.  Anybody else would obviously be able to detect flawed, repetitive gameplay.  The 2D Mario games move at such a swift pace that you don't even have time to stop and notice the platforms (unless you're an extremely slow gamer).  This is mainly because you don't have to stop and situate Mario a certain way for the purpose of making the perfect jump which is what severely ruins Super Mario 64's gameplay.  And don't EVEN say my skills are horrible when it's obvious through countless youtube videos that several gamers have the same exact issue.While I'm by no means someone who cares about the best graphics available, you gotta admit the ones here have dated horrendously with embarrassing blocky shapes pretty much occupying most areas of the game.  The buildings, water and trees in particular are just awful for the eyes.  Nothing appealing whatsoever about any of the graphics- even the bright inviting colors don't lure me in but rather rub me the wrong way and force some of us older gamers to recall the unpleasant days of Mario Paint.You have to collect 120 stars in order to complete the game 100% but guess what?  Many of the stars are flat out boring to collect due to being pathetically easy and basically being handed to you within minutes.  What kind of challenge is that?  The one where you have to swim around and open treasure chests in a certain order is baby-ish, and the one where you swim around collecting 8 predictably located red coins inside a basic building near the beginning of the game is offensive.  Or how about simply stomping a post into a ground to release a gate and thus, release the star?  Don't even *think* about mentioning the ones where you walk up to Toad and he simply hands you the star.  Granted, the game seems to always alternate easy star-collecting challenges with longer and more drawn out ones as a way to balance things out but that's the problem- the stars are either too easy or too long.  There is one star mission so awful it makes your inevitable death seem like something to anticipate- the one where you have to jump across a series of moving poles.  You have to jump at *just* the right moment while making sure you're positioned in the right spot.  This takes forever and is dreadfully annoying.Also, what's up with all the little baby games?  Grab a baby penguin and slide down a snowy hill?  Chase the bunny so he doesn't hop away?  These are not suitable for anyone who recalls the challenging portions of previous 2D gaming such as Super Mario Bros. 3 or Super Mario World (and yes, these bunny grabbing missions are flaws in Super Mario Galaxy too, in case you think I'm intentionally favoring Super Mario Galaxy for no reason).  At least the cannon-shooting parts are cool.  It's fun figuring out where to launch Mario so he can land safely on upper grounds.I can't help but feel the red star collecting is overrated.  When you collect red stars in Yoshi's Island, you feel like you're given a really elaborate and perfectly executed assignment since you also have to collect flowers and stars to 100% complete a stage.  It's a lot to do not to mention really darn exciting and satisfying once you've acquired all these items, and constantly keeps your attention span in check while searching for them.  Super Mario 64 basically takes that one red coin-collecting element of Yoshi's Island and makes it a main priority here.  You often have to collect 8 red coins per stage (opposed to 20 in Yoshi's Island) to obtain one of the 120 stars.  Ugh.But nothing NOTHING is worse than the fact you have to re-enter stages over and over again just to grab all the stars that are located throughout.  To me this is unquestionably lazy game design.  How can it be anything else?  Who in their right mind would actually *want* to keep going back to the same exact stage ad nauseam?  Super Mario World was guilty of this too granted but not NEARLY to this exaggerated extent.  A terrible idea that gives a false impression a game has replay value but it's exactly the opposite- once you go through the same stage a bunch of times and finally accomplish everything there is to offer, you won't want to repeat these same objectives ever again.  So... you probably won't want to play Super Mario 64 ever again.  Even worse- when you often have to search for 100 coins to obtain a star.  This can take up to 20 minutes and bore you the entire time.  Being forced to collect 100 coins is a lazy way of assuring gamers don't leave any stone unturned because you basically have to thoroughly search every nook and cranny of a stage to even *find* 100 of them.I also dislike how many of the classic enemies aren't included here such as the hammer brothers, buzzy beetles, bloopers, and cheep cheeps.  Even the koopa troopa is nowhere to be seen (well, other than that one race in the beginning).  You can ride a koopa shell like a skateboard but that doesn't count as an enemy appearance.  He's not a true enemy here.  Why is that?  Why not include all the familiar and well-loved enemies that have become a trademark to the Mario series?  They ruin the pirahna plants by the way.  Why is he sleeping?  Granted he comes alive when you get near, but it's a really weird concept.  At least Nintendo got the boos and haunted house right- a surprising and exciting maze-like high point of the game.  It's a lot of fun sorting through each room of the haunted house stages.  *That's* how you design a memorable stage.  Obviously if you weren't busy running around through several vast and average-designed empty fields of grass, there could have EASILY been room for the inclusion of more enemies.  Hey I'm all for open world exploration, but you have to actually fill in those areas with exciting, creative items that are both fun and rewarding to collect for the player, and enemies that present threatening encounters and a rush of excitement.  Simply throwing Mario into a big 3D world because it's his first grand 3D adventure truthfully isn't going to get the job done I'm afraid.  More needs to be done.Constantly having to rearrange the camera so you can see where you're actually going is a nuisance.  Nobody likes dealing with a camera while jumping around trying to play a video game, but granted, several games back in the mid to late 90's were guilty of the same camera problems since developers were still getting their feet wet so to speak, and figuring out the best way to help players accurately and conveniently see what's ahead.  Still, you'll lose more than a few lives due to bad camera angles in Super Mario 64.  I guarantee it.  One thing I *do* like about this game is how fast Mario runs.  It's a fast-moving game, which helps going from point A to point B more convenient. Also some of the wall jumps and triple jumps are fun to execute.  Reminds me of Super Metroid in that respect.  Yoshi is teased in this game (I won't spoil how) but he's not actually playable which doesn't make sense.  Why make an appearance if he's not going to be playable?The music is either extremely good (the brilliant peaceful moodiness of the water theme and the intimidating and exciting heavy metal-like Bowser fights) or downright horrendous (everything else, which consists of annoying nursery rhyme children's themes inappropriate and painfully skull-smashing for the rest of us).  I can't STAND the theme songs that play in Whomp's Fortress and Rainbow Ride- two unforgivable themes that make me want to smash my brains in whenever I play Super Mario Galaxy 2 where they return in all their overbearingly annoying glory.  Rainbow Ride in particular reminds me of a county hayride where kids ride around on tractors (not to mention the stage itself is extremely tedious and overlong).  The snowy mountain stage with the Italian accordion music is sickening and out of place.  Just mute the volume on your TV to make life easier for yourself.  The boss fights are incredibly simplistic- grab Bowser's tail, spin him around and toss him, or pick up/stomp other bosses.  Basic, boring stuff.A few stages that are actually fun include Lethal Lava Land where the platforms convincingly feel like an upgrade into the 3D world from the original Super Mario Bros. castle levels (not to mention better/more interesting use of platform jumping compared to the rest of the levels in SM64), Shifting Sand Land since it's packed with obstacles and enemies (and reasonably challenging overall), and Tall Tall Mountain's tricky climb to the top (involving a vine climbing portion).  In fact, to be fair, Tall Tall Mountain is one of the best levels ever in a 3D Mario game.  It's *that* good.  Bowser's castle levels are pretty solid as well, mostly due to the fast-paced nature of them.Several things feel tacky- the 1-ups and coins are small, dark, ugly looking, and clumsily made due to less than spectacular graphics and game design, and overall Super Mario 64 is just a really lackluster and highly overrated game.  If not for influence, this game would have been forgotten and the superior Super Mario Galaxy series would have prevailed even more dominantly than they already do.  Oh and don't even mention the cake-eating storyline.  It's atrocious.  The fact they brought it back for the Galaxy series makes me want to vomit.",Mario's first jump into the land of 3D platforming stinks
294,Nintendo,2,"Let me just say that i think mario 64 is a okay game as far as gameplay and graphics goes but, every level get's harder and harder it's so hard it would take you months to beat it and by the time you do you would be white as a sheet from staying inside all the time and 50% of your muscles would atrophy. also the ending really sucks it ends by princess toadstool saying let's make a cake for mario then it's over so don't waste your time with this game.",If  you don't have a game shark don't buy this game
305,Nintendo,1,"Even when it first came out I tried out this game but could not get into it and I hate the n64 old style 3d graphics where the camera angle ends up getting you killed every five seconds, espessially in pits.  Of all the Mario games to date including the amazing Wii titles except for Super Mario Wii this has to be the worst Mario game for me since Mario Nes.

765,Nintendo,2,"I just have to say one thing first: There clearly are not enough buttons on the N64 controller to make a decent variety of moves. Instead, in this game, there are about nine moves, most of them useless because they do so little damage.

There are also a few too many items, and it really makes it less fair that you can use a big baseball bat or a lightsaber or a beamgun to help you win. Also, considering that the gameplay wasn't good enough, the fighting environment takes a new approach at trying to add lots of detail and affecting play, but most of the battle grounds are far too plain for what it is trying to attempt. But I will say that the game has incredible graphics, each character and scene developed beautifully. I also like that in practice mode, you can change the speed of the characters movement so it seems like slow motion. You can make the characters go at normal speed, or one-fourth of it, making for a great amount of Matrix-like suspense. The two challenge rounds are also a challenge, maybe too great a challenge, especially with characters like Yoshi, who don't get a jumping boost, but an egg to throw.

1892,Nintendo,2,"When I think of the N64, I think about great games and memories. Games like Golden-Eye 64, The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, Super Mario 64, and Banjo- Kazooie. Memories like getting my fore-head shot by my brother, grabbing my 120th power star, and meeting Princess Zelda for the first time.Donkey Kong 64 doesn't come up in any of these if you haven't noticed by now, and for good reason. It's slow, pokey, and not really all that fun. Which is really a problem after the success of the Donkey Kong Country trilogy.THE GRAPHICS: Donkey Kong 64 seems to take the graphics roll from Super Mario 64, in that the characters are a little on the blocky side, but their really not all bad. I've only come across a few complaints which is demonstrated in the following description: In one area, the room has a large wooden treasure chest with a switch of the character's face on it. Sounds fine right? Wrong, the switch attached to the chest is made from a vent in one of the previous areas. A metal switch attached to a wooden chest. Sheer laziness. VERDICT:*** 3/5THE STORY: Quite simple really, Donkey's horde of bananas have been stolen once again by King K. Rool, ruler of the Kremling reptiles. He's also done the liberty of imprisoning all of the other Kongs in cells mapped around the game. The game introduces many new character like Lanky Kong and the banana fairies, along with some pretty whacked up levels. It's not really all that original, but it works.THE VERDICT: *** 3/5THE GAME-PLAY: This is where Donkey Kong 64 kills, and not in the good way. The game rips from the popular ""grab the golden item to proceed to more levels"" style originated by Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie. Now, that would be fine since the genre has pretty much held water for years, but DK64 has you ""power-walking"" your way through each task, some of which are dragged on already.It takes me about 7 minutes just trying to go to the level I choose (except the first level). The game is loaded with long hallways, ledges you need to slowly climb, and slow frame-rate issues at times. If Rare had upped the speed to about 2.33 times faster, I probably wouldn't have constantly been yelled at to leave my younger brother's room so he could sleep. Oh yeah, and I got a serious sore thumb from holding the joystick in the same direction. This game ruins hands, and sleepy little brothers. THE VERDICT: * 1/5THE MUSIC: The game ranges from toy factories, jungles, pyramids and the like, so you can imagine a wide arrange of tunes to come across. Some of the music is pretty catchy, but I didn't find myself dazzled by any means. I found myself humming 2 or 3 songs, but that was it, none of which you'll be hearing very often. The sound-effects are fitting and pretty original. Thanks to this game every time I see an orange, I immediately think of the sound the orange grenades make in this game. Pretty funny right? VERDICT: *** 3/5OVERALL: DK64 had a lot of hype, and it's a shame it didn't turn out since it was made by the same guys behind the Donkey Kong County, Battletoads, and Jet Force Gemini series, which were excellent gems.

You essentially have 7 levels before the boss level, and you have to beat each of these levels with 5 different characters. So, you have to spend your time getting all of DK's bananas and missing the other 4 characters' bananas, because only Diddy can get Diddy bananas, only Tiny can get Tiny coins, etc. This means you have to basically go back and re-do the whole level with another character all over again.Couple this with the fact that camera angles are constantly changing on you, it makes for a very ho-hum experience.At one point during the 30 hours it took me to beat this game, I turned on the game and found all my data was erased. At first I was angry, but then kind of relieved that I didn't have to feel like I needed to finish this game anymore. That's saying a lot, because I always finish games I start.

I was upset, especially when I got to the first door requiring gold bananas. Why couldn't they have just put out another Banjo-Kazooie game and make an ORIGINAL Donkey Kong game for the N64.Banjo-Kazooie was fun, until the difficulty spiked out of nowhere. Also, the idea of making a cartoonish adventure somewhat nonlinear is poorly executed in it.I didn't play far enough to see if Donkey Kong corrected any of this, but it looks like it didn't. It just changed the setting from running around inside of a mountain to running around inside of islands. Great.If you liked Banjo-Kazooie, I'm sure you'll love this. If not, definitely skip Donkey Kong.",fun for the half hour i played
1936,Nintendo,2,"For the Nintendo '64 gaming system, the two pre-eminent adventure games were Mario and Zelda.  Those games enthralled players with their tight gameplay and interesting stories.  Unfortunately, DK '64 doesn't have that same tight gameplay, and the story was never the strong suit of the series.The problem with this game is obvious after about 30 minutes: It's all about collecting items, and very little else.  Whether it is coins, tokens, or bananas, this game quickly devolves into little more than a scavenger hunt for miscellaneous items.  Making matters worse is the fact that EACH CHARACTER needs to collect each item to unlock certain features.  The game is tedious enough playing just as a single character, but add in the four others and it becomes ridiculous.The music in this game is engaging (the DK Rap might just be the highlight of the whole experience!), but other than that nothing really stands out.  If you don't mind collecting item after item, you'll like this game more than I.  If you prefer a developed plot, however, than stay away at all costs.","Too Much Collecting, Too Little Story"
1947,Nintendo,2,"When I think of the N64, I think about great games and memories. Games like Golden-Eye 64, The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, Super Mario 64, and Banjo- Kazooie. Memories like getting my fore-head shot by my brother, grabbing my 120th power star, and meeting Princess Zelda for the first time.Donkey Kong 64 doesn't come up in any of these if you haven't noticed by now, and for good reason. It's slow, pokey, and not really all that fun. Which is really a problem after the success of the Donkey Kong Country trilogy.THE GRAPHICS: Donkey Kong 64 seems to take the graphics roll from Super Mario 64, in that the characters are a little on the blocky side, but their really not all bad. I've only come across a few complaints which is demonstrated in the following description: In one area, the room has a large wooden treasure chest with a switch of the character's face on it. Sounds fine right? Wrong, the switch attached to the chest is made from a vent in one of the previous areas. A metal switch attached to a wooden chest. Sheer laziness. VERDICT:*** 3/5THE STORY: Quite simple really, Donkey's horde of bananas have been stolen once again by King K. Rool, ruler of the Kremling reptiles. He's also done the liberty of imprisoning all of the other Kongs in cells mapped around the game. The game introduces many new character like Lanky Kong and the banana fairies, along with some pretty whacked up levels. It's not really all that original, but it works.THE VERDICT: *** 3/5THE GAME-PLAY: This is where Donkey Kong 64 kills, and not in the good way. The game rips from the popular ""grab the golden item to proceed to more levels"" style originated by Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie. Now, that would be fine since the genre has pretty much held water for years, but DK64 has you ""power-walking"" your way through each task, some of which are dragged on already.It takes me about 7 minutes just trying to go to the level I choose (except the first level). The game is loaded with long hallways, ledges you need to slowly climb, and slow frame-rate issues at times. If Rare had upped the speed to about 2.33 times faster, I probably wouldn't have constantly been yelled at to leave my younger brother's room so he could sleep. Oh yeah, and I got a serious sore thumb from holding the joystick in the same direction. This game ruins hands, and sleepy little brothers. THE VERDICT: * 1/5THE MUSIC: The game ranges from toy factories, jungles, pyramids and the like, so you can imagine a wide arrange of tunes to come across. Some of the music is pretty catchy, but I didn't find myself dazzled by any means. I found myself humming 2 or 3 songs, but that was it, none of which you'll be hearing very often. The sound-effects are fitting and pretty original. Thanks to this game every time I see an orange, I immediately think of the sound the orange grenades make in this game. Pretty funny right? VERDICT: *** 3/5OVERALL: DK64 had a lot of hype, and it's a shame it didn't turn out since it was made by the same guys behind the Donkey Kong County, Battletoads, and Jet Force Gemini series, which were excellent gems. I played this game as a kid years ago and completed everything in the game, I really must have exaggerated greatly how fun it was back then, because I can't seem to have any courage to attempt getting everything in just level 4.

    Nintendo",2,"(This review was updated on July 10th, 2006)I've changed my mind about Super Mario World and actually think it deserves 4 stars.  I was just in a bad mood when I originally gave the game a 2-star rating.  It turns out Super Mario World is not just a game you can enjoy growing up in the early 90's.  It actually has a lot of replay value and years later our children can enjoy Super Mario World the same way WE did.I still stand by what I say in the original review: ""The Donkey Kong Country series, for example, came along with a similar idea and made it more exciting IMO, so, if I were you I'd go with one of those games instead of Super Mario World.  For the most part the levels in the DKC series feel different from each other (plus, they feel more creative and memorable).  Unfortunately, many of the levels in Super Mario World are all basically the same and, as a result, I feel exhausted after playing the game for two hours.To put it another way- in Super Mario World it feels like you're going through the levels simply to collect coins and extra lives.  In the Donkey Kong Country series, you pretty much do the same thing (except bananas instead of coins) but it seems like the DKC series offers more creativity in the level design, which allows you to look forward to each stage and think to yourself ""I wonder what cool thing I get to do in THIS stage"".  It's not like that in Super Mario World.""I still believe that, but I've recently come to change my mind a little and think that, even though most of the levels in Super Mario World feel the same, that's not necessarily a BAD thing.  I also don't think the graphics in SMW are as nice as many reviewers think.  They sort of look blocky but, to their credit, Nintendo games have always had plenty of pretty colors, which is a plus.So go ahead and buy Super Mario World if you want to experience the joy of old-school Mario (the games MY generation grew up with).  After all, it's Mario and Mario games always have something decent going for them (except Mario Is Missing, but with time we've come to realize that game never even existed!)Super Mario World is basically Super Mario Bros. 3 (but without all the cool Mario suits and less creative worlds).  I like in Super Mario Bros. 3 how you have water, desert, air, plant and ice worlds (in addition to more).  In Super Mario World you just have UNUSUAL worlds such as Chocolate Island and Forest of Illusion.  Those aren't as neat as the worlds in Super Mario Bros. 3.  Super Mario World should have been the best Mario game yet but Nintendo took a few steps back (but with a MONSTER like Super Mario Bros. 3 I guess it would have been difficult to make a better Mario game right after it).Another problem in Super Mario World is that if you want to get a perfect score (96) you not only have to reach the goal in every single level, but you also have to find and grab a key in certain levels (but not all levels have keys).  This means you have to go through many levels a SECOND time.  It's sort of boring.  Once is enough.  The concept of collecting keys wasn't a good one.  I guess the good part is that if you are wearing a cape, you can quickly fly through the levels (except for water levels, and any level where the screen pushes you to the right) but that's not fun either because all you do is continue flying and pushing the back button to stay up high in the air until you reach the goal (or the key).  However, at the end of the day none of this is really enough to make the game bad in any way.  I just get tired of it.Go ahead and get it.  Yes, it's a classic.",good game... but maybe not quite a classic

    Nintendo",1,"This is one of the most overrated games of the Mario series. First of all, it's extremely difficult and frustrating. There's always been a problem with Mario games concerning the controls, they're slippery and not responsive enough for the difficulty of the game. Also the fact that the only attack Mario can do is jump on his enemies, at least in this game which isn't enough arsenal for the amount of enemies that are set against you at one time (armies of them). I know people who have been stuck on the same level for years and it makes me wonder why people bother with this game.Another dire problem is the process of saving your game. The game only lets you save at designated points instead of saving at the completion of each level which again makes this game seem frustrating when you complete a substantial amount of the game and suddenly die and get sent back five to eight levels for losing all your lives.I would've given the game 2 stars for the graphics alone which look somewhat advanced for 1991 but there are so many games from the 16 bit era that surpassed it that I'm going to ignore the graphics in this review because they simply don't make up for its lack of detail and intuitiveness in everything else. In comparison to Donkey Kong Country and Sonic The Hedgehog 3 this game is dwarfed for its graphics. Another reason to overlook the graphics is the blending of levels in which the same type of level looks nearly identical to every level of its kind.And let's not forget the overrated soundtrack. The music is dull, repetitive, and juvenile and not in good way. It's not uncommon to hear the same music being played for three or more consecutive levels which is  ridiculous because they didn't even do this on the NES.Now don't get me wrong, I'm a casual Nintendo fan who immensely enjoyed other games on the Super Nintendo and Nintendo games on newer consoles, Super Mario World isn't one of them because it's frustrating and it sucks. the graphics suck, boring game",Don't waste your time playing this game

And Mallow and Geno are loaded with fail, and I don't see why people want them in Smash Brothers, which is a crap game as well. The plot tries to be all original by not centering on Bowser kidnapping and raping Peach, who is called Toadstool for whatever reason, but on some character named Smithy who is trying to take over the world by getting stars. Whatever. And the battle system is awful as well. I mean, timed hits?For a good Mario game, play Mario is Missing!, Mario's Time Machine, or the CDI classic, Hotel Mario.

At the begining it has some cheesey video of what happend to peach. It took me forever to beat it and as soon as i did i felt much better and it did not seem as much as a dumb game. The graphics r ur ordinary snes graphics and the sound is not as good as most snes games.

    Nintendo",1,"This is one of the worst RPG's ever in existance. Besides being easy, it also has an unoriginal plot and crap graphics. I think the Atari 2600's system is more advanced than this game. I mean, what's an RPG without scantly clad women? This RPG has none, except for a princess who is as clothed as a fememist is. And Mallow and Geno are loaded with fail, and I don't see why people want them in Smash Brothers, which is a crap game as well. The plot tries to be all original by not centering on Bowser kidnapping and raping Peach, who is called Toadstool for whatever reason, but on some character named Smithy who is trying to take over the world by getting stars. Whatever. And the battle system is awful as well. I mean, timed hits?For a good Mario game, play Mario is Missing!, Mario's Time Machine, or the CDI classic, Hotel Mario. If you want a good RPG, for the SNES, play Dungeon Master of Final Fantasy Mystic Quest. the graphics suck, boring game","It's a me, a Mario! And I needa to goa killa myself!"

    Nintendo",2,Like i said i do not like RPGs and especially this one. I have it because of course its mario and im willing to try any mario. It takes so long to beat it because the RPG and it gets on ur nerves when u cant beat a boss or enemy and u have to restart and beat them. At the begining it has some cheesey video of what happend to peach. It took me forever to beat it and as soon as i did i felt much better and it did not seem as much as a dumb game. The graphics r ur ordinary snes graphics and the sound is not as good as most snes games. I dont like it because its an RPG but the only reason i keep it is because it adds to the collection and my little cousin loves to play it.,Not very good.

There is almost nothing else to do with  this game:  although it offers multiple other features, none of these  merits any praise.For example, the game comes with 9 &quot;mini  games&quot; of sorts...which are all basically variations of each other in  that they all require mindless button mashing.  Some require TIMED button  mashing...woo hoo.  The only one that speaks to be something worth anyone's  time is the Clefairy memory game, which requires you to remember sequences  of arrows and repeat them within a time limit.

These pokemon all have  attacks pre-assigned to them - and higher evolutions aren't necessarily  better, because the lower evolutions have superior attacks (so that  everyone isnt choosing charizard over cute lil ol charmander).

Pok&eacute;mon Stadium used the Nintendo 64 to its full use on detail in this game, but the soundboard on the game can get slightly tedious and annoying. With an announcer restating every move you just made over the loudspeaker, it makes you want to play the game with the sounds off, and if your going to play it with the sound off you might as well not play it at all.Overall I give this game a 2 out of 5. It has great graphics, but the game couldn't seem to pinpoint the certain aspects of a Pok&eacute;mon game that its players love; the story and the adventure side.",Why it Couldn't Sell Out The Stadium

In this game, however, it wears thin very quickly, especially in the Boss battles, where one hit is often enough to send Wario flying off the screen, making it almost impossible to beat any given boss in less then seven tries.The game's level design must've looked good on paper, but is very poorly executed. You must go through each stage four or five times to find all the keys, chests and tresaures. Time of day is factored as well, and after finding a tresure almost every stage in the game is radically changed. For example, find the seeds in one level, and now there are huge vines growing everywhere in the levels you've already completed, allowing access to new areas and items. It can get very repetitives very quickly.Also, for some reason, Warioland 3 has the worst graphics of the series. The first game even looks better. Backgrounds are almost nonexistant, textures are bland, and, although this game was the first made specifically for the Game Boy Color, Wario is made up of only two colors.

For the life of me I don't get the appeal of this game.  Through each of the eight boring worlds it's just the same thing every time: run to the end of each and every extremely short, uncreative level collecting worthless crap so you can move on to the next short, uncreative level.  Super Mario Bros. 3 is complete baboon poop.  It really is.  Nothing good about this game at all.  No reason for Mario or video game fans to remember this crappy adventure.  No reason for this game to exist.  Thank God there are sensible people out there such as myself to give you the honest truth.Let's get right to the point and talk about all the stinky things:One, and this is the biggest reason Super Mario Bros. 3 isn't any good.  You can only play as Mario and Luigi.  In Super Mario Bros. 2 you can play as the Princess and Toad in addition to Mario and Luigi.  Not so here.  In this game, Mario and Luigi don't even have anything unique to separate the two, so they are basically the same exact person (except Mario is red and Luigi is green).  Remember how high Luigi can jump in Super Mario Bros. 2?  Well now he jumps just like Mario.  Absolutely no reason for this.  If anything, Luigi should have MANY more interesting things about him this time around since, after all, Super Mario Bros. 3 comes AFTER Super Mario Bros. 2 and you'd think the most logical thing would be to continue adding MORE things with each new series.  But in this case, you get less.  I guess Nintendo FORGOT to make Luigi stand apart from Mario.Another problem: this game is so freakin' predictable.  Gee, after the desert world I go to... a water world?  You don't say!  What?  There's an ICE world and a plant world coming up?  No way!  And what's THIS I see?  The final world will be BIG DARK EVIL FIRE WORLD?  I didn't see THAT coming.  Thanks Nintendo, for making Mario fans look like complete idiots.  Way to go.Other serious problems become noticeable after a couple hours of playtime such as the fact that you have to do so much boring jumping in this game.  You have to jump on top of (or over) SO many things that it becomes an absolute chore after world 3 (if you even MAKE it that far without shutting off the game, that is).  If you find anything exciting about jumping over pipes or jumping on top of goombas or picking up and kicking buzzy beetles, then I recommend seeking professional help.Ok, what else makes Super Mario Bros. 3 suck so much?  It can't get any worse, right?  Yes it can.  After you beat the game a message comes up on the screen that says ""Thank you, but our princess is in another castle.  Just kidding, hahaha"".  You mean to tell me, after all that long, hard and tedious work making it to the very end, Nintendo is going to joke around and make like the adventure isn't over yet?  Before the ""just kidding"" part, you might very well rip apart your controller or punch a hole in your TV screen all because Nintendo wants to play around and pretend there's still more to the adventure.  I can't even think of appropriate words to describe how angry this makes me.  Tears of anger are almost dripping down my face.  Nintendo NEVER should have done that.  I bet that most people who first seen that message really thought the princess was in another castle and came THIS close to killing the nearest living thing next to them.  Bad Nintendo.And guess what?  You have to face one of Bowser's kids at the end of every world.  I'm not kidding.  I was honestly expecting to fight Bowser's WIFE before fighting him, but it never happened.  That's probably for the better.  Who knows how horrific she looks.I'm still trying to figure out what everyone sees in this game.  It's old and forgettable.  Honestly, I think nowadays the only people who enjoy Super Mario Bros. 3 are older folks whose children have moved away to college or to start a family, and they left behind their NES and Super Mario Bros. 3 cartridge so their parents had something to do.

It's an abomination to the license and one of the worst games ever created in the history of Nintendo. Yeah, I'm a fan of Zelda. No, I don't like easy games. I like games which challenge my skill & intellect, not my patience & sanity. I disliked Zelda II when it first came out but gave it a second chance when offered as a free download to my 3DS from Nintendo. After a very solid second shot, it's now deleted from my system. Where can I even begin?? There are no rewards for defeating opponents. The control is appalling. There's no strategy involved. It's too easy to get hurt, almost impossible to heal, and no matter where you are in the game, dying forces you to start over at the beginning. This isn't a game. This is a violation of the Geneva Convention. Unless you have a mental disorder which causes you to enjoy having to complete the same monotonous tasks OVER AND OVER, don't bother. In fact, the game could even cost you hundreds to play. For some, the torment & frustration could cause you to destroy a perfectly good console. It wouldn't have taken much to turn this into an enjoyable game. It's as though the designers were TRYING to kill the Zelda license. Thank God it survived to have a third title.

I owned, and still own the very first Zelda video game, and I must say, it is to this day the greatest 8 bit game ever designed. I had never played the Zelda 2 for the nes before. I had heard a lot of negative things about this game, for being a rather weak installment in the Zelda series. Not listening, I decided to purchase this game for the wii virtual console. Guess what? They were right! This game is bad! I kept saying to myself ""there are no, bad Zelda games. There are no, bad Zelda games."" As you can probably see, I ripped that quote off from the Wizard of Oz, ""There's no place, like home."" Quite fitting if you ask me.Adventure Link is quite the sloppy one. You go from one perspective, to another. Quite irritatting if you ask me. It's a shame how good the graphics are, and how unfitting the gameplay is. The gameplay is not stiff, but slippery. It feels like you are in an ice level throughout the entire game. No joke.The change in graphics are very good for the nes system. I find it quite detailed, and a big push for the nes console. I also cannot take the fact that the music is absolutely beautiful, and the only reson I play this crappy game. I mean just listen to this track[...]Awesome right?That's about all you get out of this game. Overall, this game sucks! I can certainly see why fans didn't like it. A combination of hard platforming, bad gameplay, and poor writing, makes the game unplayable. I know I am a huge Zelda fan, but I have yet to play a link to the past.

    Nintendo",1,"If only it were possible to rate a zero, this game would have earned it. Not only should this game NEVER have been made, every copy found to exist should be destroyed. It's an abomination to the license and one of the worst games ever created in the history of Nintendo. Yeah, I'm a fan of Zelda. No, I don't like easy games. I like games which challenge my skill & intellect, not my patience & sanity. I disliked Zelda II when it first came out but gave it a second chance when offered as a free download to my 3DS from Nintendo. After a very solid second shot, it's now deleted from my system. Where can I even begin?? There are no rewards for defeating opponents. The control is appalling. There's no strategy involved. It's too easy to get hurt, almost impossible to heal, and no matter where you are in the game, dying forces you to start over at the beginning. This isn't a game. This is a violation of the Geneva Convention. Unless you have a mental disorder which causes you to enjoy having to complete the same monotonous tasks OVER AND OVER, don't bother. In fact, the game could even cost you hundreds to play. For some, the torment & frustration could cause you to destroy a perfectly good console. It wouldn't have taken much to turn this into an enjoyable game. It's as though the designers were TRYING to kill the Zelda license. Thank God it survived to have a third title. But the second title should have been recalled & buried. the graphics suck, boring game",Utter Crap

    Nintendo",2,"Ahh Zelda, arguably the greatest video game franchise ever made. I owned, and still own the very first Zelda video game, and I must say, it is to this day the greatest 8 bit game ever designed. I had never played the Zelda 2 for the nes before. I had heard a lot of negative things about this game, for being a rather weak installment in the Zelda series. Not listening, I decided to purchase this game for the wii virtual console. Guess what? They were right! This game is bad! I kept saying to myself ""there are no, bad Zelda games. There are no, bad Zelda games."" As you can probably see, I ripped that quote off from the Wizard of Oz, ""There's no place, like home."" Quite fitting if you ask me.Adventure Link is quite the sloppy one. You go from one perspective, to another. Quite irritatting if you ask me. It's a shame how good the graphics are, and how unfitting the gameplay is. The gameplay is not stiff, but slippery. It feels like you are in an ice level throughout the entire game. No joke.The change in graphics are very good for the nes system. I find it quite detailed, and a big push for the nes console. I also cannot take the fact that the music is absolutely beautiful, and the only reson I play this crappy game. I mean just listen to this track[...]Awesome right?That's about all you get out of this game. Overall, this game sucks! I can certainly see why fans didn't like it. A combination of hard platforming, bad gameplay, and poor writing, makes the game unplayable. I know I am a huge Zelda fan, but I have yet to play a link to the past. I am planning on purchasing it on the wii virtual console in the next couple of weeks, and once I do, I will review it immediately.Thanks for reading!",A misfit in the Zelda franchise

    Nintendo",2,This game for me is a weak attempt to copy the game 'Tetris'. It just  isnt as fun or challenging as i had hoped. The only plus that i see with this game is that it would be preferred over tetris by children because of the colorful graphics and cartoon look. So if you have children and are looking for a good clean kid friendly game to keep them entertained and expand their hand/eye coordination then this game might be a good choice.,Yoshi game

Granted the game is big, which means there is lots of exploring, there is one set of closely related problems that make Metroid less than steller, all related to attacking: Samus curls (or does nothing if you don't have the ball) when you press down so she cannot duck and shoot, disabling her from attacking small anemies on the ground until she has the ball-bomb or wave beam much later in the game. Additionally, Samus cannot shoot diagnally in any direction and she cannot shoot downwards. In my review of Super Mario 64, I said that one shouldn't only complain about what a game does NOT have; however, these features would be practically essential to the game.Buy only if you are a hardcore Metroid fan or you really want to play the game that started it all.

5944,Nintendo,2,"My problem with Conker doesn't have as much to do with the idea so much as it does the follow-through. In all honesty, I was thrilled to hear the company had recognized their own flaws and were attempting to reconcile for them by releasing a shockingly robust title that seemed to spit in the face of everything they'd done since the debates caused by the home release of the original Mortal Kombat. However, I left my initial playing with the sense that the while idea itself was exactly what the company needed, the execution was more than a tad lacking.The story plays out like a theatrical feature, which is appropriate considering the number of situations the game eventually borrows from popular films. Glass of milk (or is it a white russian?) in hand and a scowl plastered upon his face, Conker is immediately reminiscent of the kind of anti-hero popularized by Bruce Willis in Die Hard or Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction. Surrounded by his supposed friends and acquaintances, this introductory scene was a great way to set the tone of the story and introduce a hardened, slightly older version of the title's namesake. The moment the king's flashback begins is when the player begins to take control of the action.There's a lot of Hollywood inspiration in Conker's tale. From the little nuances and cliches such as the opening scene, to borrowed scenes or tips of the hat to films like the location of the King's throne at the end of the game, to straightforward rip-offs of memorable scenes or films like the unquestionably Matrix bank heist, this cartridge is chock full of film-lore. And, to its credit, the vast majority of the game's quirks, nods and thefts are handled very well, with just enough originality and additional humor thrown in to make it work within the broad confines of its storyline.For the most part, the story is successful. Its film parodies are spot on, while its original threads tend to lag behind a bit and force a joke just for the sake of it. It feels like the game was rushed, and rather than waiting for the inspiration to create something undeniably funny, the writers instead went with whatever they came up with the fastest. In addition, there's little if any direction as to what you should be doing at any point in the story. Bad Fur Day is a big fan of putting you in the middle of an immense area with no visual clues as to where you should go from there, then erecting giant invisible walls out of thin air and hoping that their placement will corral you into the exact area in which you should be. Successful or not, this method is employed over and over and over again, from the game's start until its finish.While the storyline is competent for the most part, the actual control and gameplay itself is nearly unforgivable. Physically controlling Conker is a complete nightmare. Even the use of the N64's well-designed analog joystick can't save this horribly imprecise setup, as the squirrel will occasionally veer left or right without explanation or mosey over the edge of a cliff moments after you've told him to stop moving entirely. Conker does have a sort of double-jump feature, in that through the use of his tail he can hover in the air for a couple additional seconds. He can also perform a high jump and a long jump, by crouching or running for a few second before leaping, accordingly. Unfortunately, these high jump and long jump options only seem to work when they feel like it. I've been running for upwards of a full minute, jumped, and watched Conker perform a weak little sissy jump and fall to his doom. This game really feels like something that wasn't fully tested before its release, the controls reek of incompletion.Add onto that one of the most horrific cameras in the history of 3-D rendering, and you've already got a pissed off gamer. Seriously, you're given supposed control of these angles through the use of the C buttons (similar to the way the camera is maneuvered in The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time), but as soon as you find a vantage point you're comfortable with and release the C button, it just goes off on its own and returns to a completely unhelpful, useless view. This camera cannot pass through walls, so if your back is against one and you're trying to prepare for a complicated, lengthy, precise leap, you've got to do it blind. Better still, once you've made up your mind and attempted said jump, the camera will awkwardly spin as soon as it's got room to get behind you, effectively reversing your controls in mid-air and introducing a loss of direction to your life.The audio is one of the few undeniable triumphs of this one. The voice acting is tremendous, Conker's voice suits him perfectly and the actors themselves seem to be having a lot of fun with the material. The music is the usual fare for Rare platformers, light and bouncy, and serves as a constant joke considering the circumstances surrounding it. Little tidbits like the main character mumbling to himself and retching when he's drunk, or fighting back bile while rolling an enormous ball of poo really make a difference in the experience, and are things I wish more games took the time to incorporate.When push comes to shove, there's really only one thing you can create with the ingredients provided by Conker's Bad Fur Day, and that's disappointment. There's no question in my mind this game needed another couple months of production before it was ready to ship, and looking back it should be regarded as the poster boy for the N64's lifespan. This game wasn't created to entertain and enamor so much as it was to annoy, frustrate and defeat.",What a Suitable Death Toll for the N64
5958,Nintendo,1,"If you want to see cute cartoon animals acting just like Beavis & ButtHead,then look no further than this disaster of a game.Once a lovable squirrel that fought acorns,poor Conker has been turned into a furry Beavis(or furry ButtHead)and generally staggers through the game,accomplishing absolutely NOTHING.And that's just how you feel when you try to play this piece of garbage-you'll constantly feel that you're not getting anywhere and that you're not accomplishing a single thing.In the game,all you do is get drunk,swear,stagger around,puke and have a hangover-all through the entire game.You'll start to feel like you're in the animal version of Beavis & ButtHead(remember how much Beavis & ButtHead love to swear,do drugs and get drunk?),and you'll start to wonder where the fun and enjoyment is.Unlike ""Conker's Pocket Tales"",there are no goals to accomplish,there is no plot,and there is absolutely NOTHING to do except swear,get drunk,puke and have a hangover.Despite how much people try to get you to believe that ""Conker's Bad Fur Day"" is the greatest game around,you'll learn the truth about this game:That it's just a big promotion for alcohol.Do yourselvwes a favor and get ""Conker's Pocket Tales"" instead.If you want a REAL M-rated game,then get Grand Theft Auto.",A worthless piece of garbage
5963,Nintendo,1,"This is a horrible game! It is really, really gory and nasty. The multiplayer mode is hard, and Rare really made a big mistake! If I could choose to buy either Yoshi's Story or BFD, I would choose YS, and I'm 19! Oh, Conker, what have they done to you!",Horrible!

This little twerp pees on his enemies, swears, gets drunk, posses as an army guy, and does other stupid things. This is not a game for children to be playing. He even has sex with girls in some movies. Parents, don't even consider buying this for your five year old. Infact, not even when they're seventeen.","Kids, don't look!!!"
5976,Nintendo,2,"This game a foul - the long cut scenes are full of disgusting humor. Those were the best bits. The actual game iteself seemed like cruel and unusual punishment. The 'puzzles' wouldn't stump a four year old and the game play is tedious and repetitive. If I hadn't borrowed the game from a friend I would have put it down the garbage disposal by now.The game suffers from many of the problems that Nintendo games have. You have long and tedious jumping sequences in which the character will often fail to jump for no apparent reason causing you to have to repeat the sequence from the start over and over ad nauseam. The direction the character moves depends on the camera angle and, as the camera will swing around unpredictable, the character will suddenly start marching off in a totally different direction when you haven't moved the joystick. As much of this 'game' involves walking along narrow paths, this is a real pisser.I picked up the controller exactly three time with this game and each time I threw it down in disgust 30 minutes later. I guess I'm a slow learner. If they the game out and just left the cut scenes you'd have something I'd probably pay $5 for but at least I'd think I'd gotten value for my money.The game seems designed to irritate and annoy the player. Don't buy it unless you really enjoy repeating the same boring stuff over and over.",crude humor good - game play bad

Seriously, you're given supposed control of these angles through the use of the C buttons (similar to the way the camera is maneuvered in The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time), but as soon as you find a vantage point you're comfortable with and release the C button, it just goes off on its own and returns to a completely unhelpful, useless view. This camera cannot pass through walls, so if your back is against one and you're trying to prepare for a complicated, lengthy, precise leap, you've got to do it blind. Better still, once you've made up your mind and attempted said jump, the camera will awkwardly spin as soon as it's got room to get behind you, effectively reversing your controls in mid-air and introducing a loss of direction to your life.The audio is one of the few undeniable triumphs of this one. The voice acting is tremendous, Conker's voice suits him perfectly and the actors themselves seem to be having a lot of fun with the material. The music is the usual fare for Rare platformers, light and bouncy, and serves as a constant joke considering the circumstances surrounding it. Little tidbits like the main character mumbling to himself and retching when he's drunk, or fighting back bile while rolling an enormous ball of poo really make a difference in the experience, and are things I wish more games took the time to incorporate.When push comes to shove, there's really only one thing you can create with the ingredients provided by Conker's Bad Fur Day, and that's disappointment. There's no question in my mind this game needed another couple months of production before it was ready to ship, and looking back it should be regarded as the poster boy for the N64's lifespan. This game wasn't created to entertain and enamor so much as it was to annoy, frustrate and defeat.",What a Suitable Death Toll for the N64
6019,Nintendo,1,"If you want to see cute cartoon animals acting just like Beavis & ButtHead,then look no further than this disaster of a game.Once a lovable squirrel that fought acorns,poor Conker has been turned into a furry Beavis(or furry ButtHead)and generally staggers through the game,accomplishing absolutely NOTHING.And that's just how you feel when you try to play this piece of garbage-you'll constantly feel that you're not getting anywhere and that you're not accomplishing a single thing.In the game,all you do is get drunk,swear,stagger around,puke and have a hangover-all through the entire game.You'll start to feel like you're in the animal version of Beavis & ButtHead(remember how much Beavis & ButtHead love to swear,do drugs and get drunk?),and you'll start to wonder where the fun and enjoyment is.Unlike ""Conker's Pocket Tales"",there are no goals to accomplish,there is no plot,and there is absolutely NOTHING to do except swear,get drunk,puke and have a hangover.Despite how much people try to get you to believe that ""Conker's Bad Fur Day"" is the greatest game around,you'll learn the truth about this game:That it's just a big promotion for alcohol.Do yourselvwes a favor and get ""Conker's Pocket Tales"" instead.If you want a REAL M-rated game,then get Grand Theft Auto.",A worthless piece of garbage
6024,Nintendo,1,"This is a horrible game! It is really, really gory and nasty. The multiplayer mode is hard, and Rare really made a big mistake! If I could choose to buy either Yoshi's Story or BFD, I would choose YS, and I'm 19! Oh, Conker, what have they done to you!",Horrible!
6034,Nintendo,1,"Conker's Bad Fur Day may look like some cute Banjo Kazooie game, but guess what? It is far more complex than Banjo Kazooie. This little twerp pees on his enemies, swears, gets drunk, posses as an army guy, and does other stupid things. This is not a game for children to be playing. He even has sex with girls in some movies. Parents, don't even consider buying this for your five year old. Infact, not even when they're seventeen.","Kids, don't look!!!"
6037,Nintendo,2,"This game a foul - the long cut scenes are full of disgusting humor. Those were the best bits. The actual game iteself seemed like cruel and unusual punishment. The 'puzzles' wouldn't stump a four year old and the game play is tedious and repetitive. If I hadn't borrowed the game from a friend I would have put it down the garbage disposal by now.The game suffers from many of the problems that Nintendo games have. You have long and tedious jumping sequences in which the character will often fail to jump for no apparent reason causing you to have to repeat the sequence from the start over and over ad nauseam. The direction the character moves depends on the camera angle and, as the camera will swing around unpredictable, the character will suddenly start marching off in a totally different direction when you haven't moved the joystick. As much of this 'game' involves walking along narrow paths, this is a real pisser.I picked up the controller exactly three time with this game and each time I threw it down in disgust 30 minutes later. I guess I'm a slow learner. If they the game out and just left the cut scenes you'd have something I'd probably pay $5 for but at least I'd think I'd gotten value for my money.The game seems designed to irritate and annoy the player. Don't buy it unless you really enjoy repeating the same boring stuff over and over.",crude humor good - game play bad

    Nintendo",2,"Now I myself personally love me some Super Mario. If you checked my reviews, you'll see that I've givenSuper Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros 3&Super Mario World: Super Mario Advanceall high ratings. When I purchased those two games, I've noticed that Nintendo made some changes with those games since the last time I've owned them on Super Nintendo. So here I am with Super Mario Advance, which is Super Mario 2 on Game Boy Advance, and I have to say that I've not impressed at all with this one. I understand that video games ""evolve"" over time and creaters try to make them better, but there is a difference between making the game better than the origonal, and making it complicated than the origonal. Nintendo did the latter with this game.Changes for the good are nice for me. On this one you can pick you character each time you die (actually you could do that since theSuper Mario All-Starsgame, and I didn't know you couldn't do that on the origonal NES game until I was playing my cousin's Wii a few days ago). Also it tells you each characters power under them on the select screen. Another helpful change is when you collect the star which makes you become invincible for a few seconds. Back then when you collect a certain amount of cherries, a star would just randomly float from the bottom of the screen. On here you'll hear some kind of tone which warns you the star is comming.Not so good changes are very visible. First of all, what got me was during the beginning of the game, there is a long drop before you reach the bottom and start. They changed that too, which sucks. Also on the origonal game you started off big (the status you are when you have at least two hearts on the left side of the screen). Here you're small (with one heart on the left side), which really isn't a problem because you can find hearts anywhere to make you grow. Back then if you kill enough enemies, a heart will float from the ground and you gain more life. Here, hearts are inside the plants you pick up from the ground and sitting idle in high places on levels. And what really ticks me off is the red shell that you can pick up from the ground. Back then you threw the red shell at an enemie and it would have hit the wall and dissapeared. Here if you throw a shell, it will bounce off the wall and keep going, and if it hits you, you loose a heart or die (come on now!). And whats the deal with those huge Shy Guys and Turnip Plants? And like every Mario game, the characters speak (Peach doesn't know when to shut up). Hell even Birdo speaks (that purple dinosaur that shoot out eggs), and half the time I don't even knows what she is saying.There you have it with Super Mario 2 on Game Boy Advance. What I believed happened was that Nintendo received feedback since 1993 when this game was reissued on SNES on how difficult the game was and tried their best to make it easier and more fun for new and younger Nintendo gamers, because I played the origonal on the Wii and it was the exact version on the NES and it was way harder. Older guys like me will definately find this game flawed if you've had it in different formats. Nintendo has made some great reissues with great modifications, but they shot a brick with this one big time.

    Nintendo",2,"This game is a big disappointment from Nintendo.  First off, the original game wasn't all that great to begin with due to its tiny worlds, nonexistant powerups, and simple boss characters.  However,  what makes this game a real loser is that it's worse than the the SNES remake on the Super Mario All-Stars game and even the original NES game!The game does have some advantages over previous versions:1) The graphics are taken from Super Mario All-Stars and therefore are an improvement over the original.2) The mindnumbingly boring slot machine scene after each tiny world have been made more tolerable since you can now bet a group of coins instead of making individual bets for each and every coin you have.3) Like All-Stars, you can pick a different character after each tiny level instead of waiting until an entire world was cleared.What makes this game worse than All-Stars?1) The horrible scrolling engine!  SMB2 had a unique scrolling style on vertical levels which remains, but the horizontal levels are torture too.  You can literally tap your character one direction or the other and the entire screen will scroll so that your character is near either the left or right edge.  The scrolling engine alone makes this game unplayable.  What is it with Nintendo and its policy of using lousy camera work for its Mario games?  I thought that was just for their 3D Mario games.2) The annoying vocal work from the 3D games has been added here to make the experience as unpleasant as possible.  Do we really need to hear ""Lucky"" after collecting a cherry?  Battle scenes with Birdo have some sort of annoying speech that I haven't made out quite yet, and it freezes the action while the dialog is being spoken.3) Weird tacked-on stuff: the game has a lot of little new things that just feel totally out of place.  Anyone familiar with the real version of the game is familiar with the inital drop that happens when you start world 1-1.  The new version is totally different and this new little vertical area is littered with everything that will annoy you about this game.My recommendation?

8743,Nintendo,1,"This is the third official version of F-Zero. There are hacks claiming to be F-Zero 2, but there are only three games in the series, F-Zero (SNES), F-Zero X (N64), & F-Zero: Maximum Velocity (GBA). F-Zero is a relatively simple concept... it is all about a space race. Each vehicle is equipped with a jet propulsion system and magnetic stabilizers. You race down the tracks at speeds exceeding 600mph. Racers from all over the galaxy come to compete. Once you are on the track, anything goes. Other racers can even push you off the track and to your death.I was rather pleased with the feel of the game. The whirr of the engines was well done for this limited audio power on the GBA.  Collision SFX did lack in the sense that they sounded more like someone sneezing.  The cityscape presented on the  earlier tracks was well preserved from the SNES version. The vehicles have a new take on appearance. These are nicely rendered in 3D when you select your machine, however in game racing uses a very dulled down version of the CG models featured in the vehicle select screen.  The track does spin nicely and appears to have slight usage of a 3D engine.I was disappointed with the actual control of the game. Racing is very difficult to control. It seems the slightest tap will send you ricocheting from wall to wall. This became increasingly annoying when I was trying to place. The recharge ports are also too small to really regain any energy. By the time you are finished being bounced around on the track, you have already passed your chance to recharge. There is definitely a high learning curve in this out of control world.I did not like the game. I enjoyed the first two F-Zero games, F-Zero X more than the original. F-Zero: Maximum Velocity just seems to take more time to learn than I am really willing to put forward. I do not recommend this to newbies of the series. If you have played previous installments, you may find value here, but as for myself, once tossed around, twice shy.",The most out of control F-Zero yet.

8770,Nintendo,1,"This is the third official version of F-Zero. There are hacks claiming to be F-Zero 2, but there are only three games in the series, F-Zero (SNES), F-Zero X (N64), & F-Zero: Maximum Velocity (GBA). F-Zero is a relatively simple concept... it is all about a space race. Each vehicle is equipped with a jet propulsion system and magnetic stabilizers. You race down the tracks at speeds exceeding 600mph. Racers from all over the galaxy come to compete. Once you are on the track, anything goes. Other racers can even push you off the track and to your death.I was rather pleased with the feel of the game. The whirr of the engines was well done for this limited audio power on the GBA.  Collision SFX did lack in the sense that they sounded more like someone sneezing.  The cityscape presented on the  earlier tracks was well preserved from the SNES version. The vehicles have a new take on appearance. These are nicely rendered in 3D when you select your machine, however in game racing uses a very dulled down version of the CG models featured in the vehicle select screen.  The track does spin nicely and appears to have slight usage of a 3D engine.I was disappointed with the actual control of the game. Racing is very difficult to control. It seems the slightest tap will send you ricocheting from wall to wall. This became increasingly annoying when I was trying to place. The recharge ports are also too small to really regain any energy. By the time you are finished being bounced around on the track, you have already passed your chance to recharge. There is definitely a high learning curve in this out of control world.I did not like the game. I enjoyed the first two F-Zero games, F-Zero X more than the original. F-Zero: Maximum Velocity just seems to take more time to learn than I am really willing to put forward. I do not recommend this to newbies of the series. If you have played previous installments, you may find value here, but as for myself, once tossed around, twice shy.",The most out of control F-Zero yet.

Most everyone who ended up reserving a Gamecube reserved Luigi's Mansion as well.Oops.Luigi's mansion is so incredibly... what's the word... oh yeah, STUPID.You start out with a plot line that you have won a haunted mansion in a contest you never entered. You encounter a ghost, and some crazy guy sucks it up with a poltergust 3000 (a vacume cleaner) You then must rescue Mario from the mansion, and thats when it gets exciting... for the one time.Whats the gameplay like? Well, you need to suck up ghosts. First you need to shine a light on them to freeze them, then press L and pull back on the control stick to suck them up. But the drop bombs down, and you go into them, and you lose health and the ghosts! It's [horrible] how you cannot control the way you go. Second, more ghosts pop out and hurt you, and you can't do anything about that either! You would not beleive how stupid the entire thing is. The entire game revolves around pressing L and holding the C-stick down. Short ""mini"" games involve you the size of a peanut againts ghosts 50x your size. Also, during gameplay, the dumbest things let you get furthur. What does sucking in a peice of paper have to do with letting 50 boo's come out of a sewer? Speaking of boo's, you need to capture 50 of them. They are virtually all the same, and by ghost 10, you are saying ""What's the point of this?"" They travel through the walls and you need to capture them by going into a different room! Once I was stuck for 10 minutes in a hallway chasing a boo from room to room. BOOOOORING. You also lose health for opening doors, having mice touch you, and you virtually are dead after 10 touches by a ghosts, plus -20 everytime it shoots out a bomb at you. The gameplay gets a 5/10.Now, I know, I sound like the old men from [a t.v. show], complaining about everything, but I can't complain about this. Despite the ...awful gameplay, the graphics will blow you away. Everything is in 3D and makes it look great. Ghosts have perfect transparentry, and the physics are perfect. If you try to suck up a cloth, it will respond to how hard you pressing the button, where you are, and how much your moving back. It's amazing. The graphics get a 10/10, but don't count on it to help this game's grade.The sound is neutral. I can't complain, but I can't praise. The ghosts basically all make the same chattery laughter, and the boo's have the exact safe sfx for all of them. The sound gets a 7/10, but I'm being generous to the fact that it was one of the first games from Gamecube.Speed's ok. It's not like Madden 2002, thank god, but it's superfast. There is loading time, but it's not annoyingly slow. Speed gets a 8/10.Controls are decent, except for one part. The y button helps you see what can kill a ghost, but it's so slow by the time you know what it is, it bumps into you and you lose major health. You also have to pull the control stick in the opposite direction, which is very difficult because it seems to change while you are holding it. You will know what I mean if you foolishly purchase this game. Controls get a 8.5/10Whats this ""replay value"" you speak of? L's Mansion has NO replay value. Whats the point of doing it again? It's gonna be exactly the same everytime! I'm not joking when I give the replay value a 1/10. You beat it, end of story.

Oh yeah! I always add points for cheats on games. Right, so now instead of a 65.83, I'm gonna give it the appropriate amount of points for cheats, leaving Luigi's Mansion new total to be... 65.83!

    Nintendo",1,"As a long time fan of the Super Mario series, I have seldom, if ever, been disappointed by any games in the entire series, from Donkey Kong (and I do mean the original arcade game that started it all) all the way to Super Mario 64. Given Nintendo's track record with this series and the absolute high quality of games for its new GameCube platform, I had every reason to think that ""Luigi's Mansion"", even if it was not up to the level of its predecessors, would be a quality entry in the series. I have to say that I was sorely disappointed.I have a certain level of tolerance for games, even ones that are frustratingly slow and plodding, but I ran out of patience with this game. I could barely even get into playing it. From the very beginning, this game gets annoying. When Luigi first enters the mansion, he encounters this stupid little professor who is supposedly there to give Luigi the background of what is happening in the mansion and teach him to use this vacuum cleaner to capture the ghosts that haunt the mansion. Yet, the idiotic professor rambles for about 10 minutes worth of dialogue and THERE IS NO WAY TO BYPASS IT!! After each brief piece of dialogue, you have to hit a button to make it continue, too. So you just can't do something else while he rambles. But, I digress. You would think that once you get past that annoyance, you could just get right into the game. WRONG! Learning to use the vacuum cleaner is incredibly aggravating. The game doesn't give you any chance to develop a feel or flow for how to use it because every time you do anything with it THAT STUPID PROFESSOR STARTS YAPPING AGAIN!!! This, alone, caused me to put the game aside for about 8 months before trying it again. Once I finally exerted enough patience to get past this madness, I figured I would finally be able get into the game. Once again, I was wrong. I find that almost every door is locked and any method of getting through those doors is hidden somewhere on the board. I had the strategy guide and could very well have looked up how to open these locked doors, but at this point, I was just too frustrated to care anymore.

You also lose health for opening doors, having mice touch you, and you virtually are dead after 10 touches by a ghosts, plus -20 everytime it shoots out a bomb at you. The gameplay gets a 5/10.Now, I know, I sound like the old men from [a t.v. show], complaining about everything, but I can't complain about this. Despite the ...awful gameplay, the graphics will blow you away. Everything is in 3D and makes it look great. Ghosts have perfect transparentry, and the physics are perfect. If you try to suck up a cloth, it will respond to how hard you pressing the button, where you are, and how much your moving back. It's amazing. The graphics get a 10/10, but don't count on it to help this game's grade.The sound is neutral. I can't complain, but I can't praise. The ghosts basically all make the same chattery laughter, and the boo's have the exact safe sfx for all of them. The sound gets a 7/10, but I'm being generous to the fact that it was one of the first games from Gamecube.Speed's ok. It's not like Madden 2002, thank god, but it's superfast. There is loading time, but it's not annoyingly slow. Speed gets a 8/10.Controls are decent, except for one part. The y button helps you see what can kill a ghost, but it's so slow by the time you know what it is, it bumps into you and you lose major health. You also have to pull the control stick in the opposite direction, which is very difficult because it seems to change while you are holding it. You will know what I mean if you foolishly purchase this game. Controls get a 8.5/10Whats this ""replay value"" you speak of? L's Mansion has NO replay value. Whats the point of doing it again? It's gonna be exactly the same everytime! I'm not joking when I give the replay value a 1/10. You beat it, end of story. What's more to do?Basically, if you want a game that will frustrate and waste your time and your hard-earned [$$], buy Luigi's Mansion. Case closed.Let's review:Gameplay: 5/10Graphics: 10/10Sound: 7/10Speed: 8/10Controls: 8.5/10Replay value: 1/10Total: 39.5/60 giving Luigi's Mansion a 65.83, my lowest review ever.Am I forgetting something? Oh yeah! I always add points for cheats on games. Right, so now instead of a 65.83, I'm gonna give it the appropriate amount of points for cheats, leaving Luigi's Mansion new total to be... 65.83! Woohoo!","""Fun"" if you like difficult, tedious and repetitive games."

    Nintendo",2,"This game doesn't compare to the other Mario games. Although the story sounds cool, there just isn't much exitement in sucking up ghosts with a vacuum cleaner. It's very monotonous; there aren't really any different places to go and although the ghosts vary in color and shape, they all basically work the same. It's more frustrating than challenging. I don't know - the areas and ghost-sucking may not bore you like it bored me. Perhaps one of the few good sides to this game is that it's interesting and unique. But the game play is definatly missing something. Koopas maybe.",Just not the expected Mario quality

Very much so. &quot;Luigi's Mansion&quot; plays out like this (In all the same order):Go into a room.Suck up gousts into your vacume cleaner (???).Find the key.Go unlock the next room.Repeat.Now go directly to jail. Do not pass GO. Do not collect $200 dollers. Even though $200 will buy you your Gamecube, this game will not take off your ming off the spent money with entertainment. Honestly, I can't come up with any reason why anyone would want to spend 6 hours sucking up gousts and then not play the game again! There is no real ending, and the game ends once you figure out that the game is getting boring. Rent only.

    Nintendo",1,"As a long time fan of the Super Mario series, I have seldom, if ever, been disappointed by any games in the entire series, from Donkey Kong (and I do mean the original arcade game that started it all) all the way to Super Mario 64. Given Nintendo's track record with this series and the absolute high quality of games for its new GameCube platform, I had every reason to think that ""Luigi's Mansion"", even if it was not up to the level of its predecessors, would be a quality entry in the series. I have to say that I was sorely disappointed.I have a certain level of tolerance for games, even ones that are frustratingly slow and plodding, but I ran out of patience with this game. I could barely even get into playing it. From the very beginning, this game gets annoying. When Luigi first enters the mansion, he encounters this stupid little professor who is supposedly there to give Luigi the background of what is happening in the mansion and teach him to use this vacuum cleaner to capture the ghosts that haunt the mansion. Yet, the idiotic professor rambles for about 10 minutes worth of dialogue and THERE IS NO WAY TO BYPASS IT!! After each brief piece of dialogue, you have to hit a button to make it continue, too. So you just can't do something else while he rambles. But, I digress. You would think that once you get past that annoyance, you could just get right into the game. WRONG! Learning to use the vacuum cleaner is incredibly aggravating. The game doesn't give you any chance to develop a feel or flow for how to use it because every time you do anything with it THAT STUPID PROFESSOR STARTS YAPPING AGAIN!!! This, alone, caused me to put the game aside for about 8 months before trying it again. Once I finally exerted enough patience to get past this madness, I figured I would finally be able get into the game. Once again, I was wrong. I find that almost every door is locked and any method of getting through those doors is hidden somewhere on the board. I had the strategy guide and could very well have looked up how to open these locked doors, but at this point, I was just too frustrated to care anymore. I put the game down for the last time...",Very bad entry in the Super Mario saga

It had a nice variety of exclusive titles and sported a lower price than both other systems. Sadly over time, the majority of the exclusive titles went multiplatform.The Gamecube uses minidiscs instead of standard CD sized discs. This has its pros and cons. It gives GC games a faster loading time than the PS2 and Xbox but it prevents CDs and DVDs from being loaded into the tray. Minidiscs only hold 1.5gb of data while a standard DVD holds 4.9gb. This makes multiplatform games harder to put on the Cube since most games are around 3.5gb and the smaller size forces developers to cut out certain parts of a game in order to put it on the Cube. Now you know why you're seeing so many games that come out on both PS2 and Xbox but not the Cube. The choice to go with minidiscs ended up biting Nintendo in the butt just like their wild decision to use cartriges for the N64.As for the control design, the Cube's controller is pretty good. It looks awkward but is actually more comfortable than the Xbox controller. However, when it comes to controllers Sony has dominated that territory with its more simple, yet effective design.As for online gaming there isn't anything available other than Phantasy Star Online.

Nintendo develops a fair amount of games itself for the system but the majority of the games are the same franchises that were around for the original NES in the 80s. Nintendo continually focuses on making Mario/Pokemon and other kiddie games for the Cube and continually ignores the tastes of adult gamers over the age of 18.

Wrong.What the hell have they made here????A GBA is supposed to be a hand held SNES, yet the SNES game never was as slow as this game, the graphics where not as bad (backgrounds are image's) the moves where executable with ease on the SNES and yet this version it takes 2 or 3 tries to get something to work because the response of the game is not fast enough!!! and the worst thing is the feel of it, you cant beat the computer with ease, everything you do gets blocked, the computer all of a sudden goes on a rampage kicking your butt and you cant do anything about it.Plus, where the hell is Johnny Cage, Goro but most important of all Raiden??? You cant have a MK game without Raiden.To screw it up even worse, it's a 2 button game now!!! no more jp,lp,lk,hk,b & r...nope, just k & p... press back+K for a roundhouse kick, press down+back+kick for a sweep... that probably would have been ok to get used to if the bloody response of it actually worked... i have to slow down my button pressing so the computer can execute the moves which sucks to high heaven.I didn't even get a fatality off, there is no one button fatality code. I played this with a gameshark and needed the infinite health code on.

14406,Nintendo,1,"Mortal Kombat Advance was released years ago, but as long as the game remains on the market, people should be warned of the utter disgrace of a title they may one day consider.  If you're reading this because that day has come, heed my words closely: There is no legitimate reason to buy Mortal Kombat Advance.  None.Midway was once well-known as a failure in making handheld versions of their popular, arcade-quality titles.  Mortal Kombat Advance is one of these.  The game is filled with bugs, making the easiest difficulty as ridiculous as it is inconsistant, then almost impossible on any difficulty from the default up.  If you're still playing the game after a half-hour or so, it's probably to figure out how to beat anyone in the higher difficulty levels; simply put, it isn't.  The game just wasn't made well enough to offer fair play against CPU, and if that's all you've got for play options, then your experience is going to be the worst possible.The rest of MKA's elements are a mixed bag.  The graphics are standard for classic Mortal Kombat games, but the animation is subpar, giving it the air a bad SNES port.  The same goes for sound, which is minimal, and music, which is poor if even existent.  There really isn't anything for this game to fall back on; not only is it shamefully unimpressive in its gameplay, but it's an embarrassment to hear and see, too.The only thing this game is even remotely good for is two-player combat.  There are over 20 ""Kombatants,"" giving players plenty of characters to keep things mixed up.  Not having to deal with the AI is a plus, but the bugs make it difficult to execute moves; consequently, fights are reduced to button-mashing and desperate attempts to pull off combos and special moves, which may or may not even work.  This too may ultimately leave you frustrated, especially since the prospect of playing two-player meant TWO copies of this game were purchased; that's simply two too many.Midway has learned its lesson since releasing Mortal Kombat Advance, releasing far better titles in MK: Deadly Alliance and MK Tournament Edition.  Again, if you're even considering Mortal Kombat Advance, do yourself a favor and don't.  There are plenty of better options out there.",A Terrible Excuse of a Game
14407,Nintendo,2,"If only Midway would put more thought into their games, this could have been one of the best games for the GBA.  First off this is an exact copy of the 16 bit versions of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, which isn't a bad thing, but the translation to the GBA could have been done much, MUCH more better, and what we have is a game that feels unfinished.  The graphics are bland, very bland.  The characters are stiff and the animation is very jerky.  The moves aren't as easy to pull off as you might think, and yeah they take practice to pull off, but they could have been made much better.  All in all, Mortal Kombat Advance isn't worth the asking price, but its not a completely bad game, just buy it when you find it in a bargain bin.",What......
14408,Nintendo,1,"Alright. I had no idea what to expect from Mortal Kombat Advance. I loved the series from MK1 to its fourth game on the N64 and Playstation. Then there's this....Okay...Maybe I should mention that I loved the CONSOLE GAMES. The only handheld game I like in the series is Mortal Kombat 2 for the Game Boy.So, I was treated with a rather glorious presentation. The graphics are still really colorful on the Game Boy Advance, and the sound is top-notch. Oh, and there's a huge variety of characters, including the off-beat versions of some of them from MK3. Oh GOD does it fall from there.Since I was new to this particular game, I tried the ""Warrior"" (aka Normal) difficulty. MY BUTT WAS BRUTALLY MURDERED BY SCORPION THE SECOND I CAME IN. Not once did I even inflict damage on him, and I was trying the hardest as possible to even give the tiniest bit of damage!Apparently, I knew I couldn't handle that difficulty. The next logical thing to do was try the ""Novice"" difficulty. After all, that is the easiest difficulty setting available at all, right?Okay...I'm not making this up: It. Didn't. Change. A. Freaking. THING. This game is impossible! It's at the same standards of horrendous as Dragon's Lair on the NES!! Do NOT play this! It's a total waste of money. Avoid it and play something better! Like...MK: Deadly Alliance on the GBA. Same system, totally better game.","""Novice"" mode? Maybe in JAPAN it is."
14409,Nintendo,1,"I thought this would be a great game. To be honest, what would you expect? The graphics look like the SNES Ultimate MK3. Well i've played the crap out of this game and I hate it. Feel free to disagree if you're good at it, but I'm a 15-year MK vet and I know exactly what I'm talking about.The graphics and sound are great. But the music loops mindlessly over and over again, probably to accomodate all the voice files on the game. That can be forgiven. I started my first match, picking Scorpion, and they throw you in a fight against Scorpion. I got my butt handed to me in seconds. So after gaming over at least twice, I went into options menu and put the difficulty on VERY EASY, assuming I would have a chance.I didn't.The game's CPU ambushes you and once you're backed into a corner, you're as good as dead. Sure I was able to use Scorpion's spear from far away about three times, but the contact boxes suck and most projectiles don't connect even when you see that they would. Someone talked about adjusting the handicap, but it only speeds up the ass-kicking, rendering you a sitting duck... or as us MK fans call them, ""noobs"".Bottom line, if you're a collector and you want every single MK game, buy it. But if you're a gamer or an MK fan, or you want to try it out, let me save you from wasting your money: Download a ROM and waste space on your PC if you want to try it so badly, but don't spend one red cent on this waste of plastic.

The game is filled with bugs, making the easiest difficulty as ridiculous as it is inconsistant, then almost impossible on any difficulty from the default up.  If you're still playing the game after a half-hour or so, it's probably to figure out how to beat anyone in the higher difficulty levels; simply put, it isn't.  The game just wasn't made well enough to offer fair play against CPU, and if that's all you've got for play options, then your experience is going to be the worst possible.The rest of MKA's elements are a mixed bag.  The graphics are standard for classic Mortal Kombat games, but the animation is subpar, giving it the air a bad SNES port.  The same goes for sound, which is minimal, and music, which is poor if even existent.  There really isn't anything for this game to fall back on; not only is it shamefully unimpressive in its gameplay, but it's an embarrassment to hear and see, too.The only thing this game is even remotely good for is two-player combat.  There are over 20 ""Kombatants,"" giving players plenty of characters to keep things mixed up.  Not having to deal with the AI is a plus, but the bugs make it difficult to execute moves; consequently, fights are reduced to button-mashing and desperate attempts to pull off combos and special moves, which may or may not even work.  This too may ultimately leave you frustrated, especially since the prospect of playing two-player meant TWO copies of this game were purchased; that's simply two too many.Midway has learned its lesson since releasing Mortal Kombat Advance, releasing far better titles in MK: Deadly Alliance and MK Tournament Edition.  Again, if you're even considering Mortal Kombat Advance, do yourself a favor and don't.  There are plenty of better options out there.",A Terrible Excuse of a Game
14424,Nintendo,2,"If only Midway would put more thought into their games, this could have been one of the best games for the GBA.  First off this is an exact copy of the 16 bit versions of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, which isn't a bad thing, but the translation to the GBA could have been done much, MUCH more better, and what we have is a game that feels unfinished.  The graphics are bland, very bland.  The characters are stiff and the animation is very jerky.  The moves aren't as easy to pull off as you might think, and yeah they take practice to pull off, but they could have been made much better.  All in all, Mortal Kombat Advance isn't worth the asking price, but its not a completely bad game, just buy it when you find it in a bargain bin.",What......
14425,Nintendo,1,"Alright. I had no idea what to expect from Mortal Kombat Advance. I loved the series from MK1 to its fourth game on the N64 and Playstation. Then there's this....Okay...Maybe I should mention that I loved the CONSOLE GAMES. The only handheld game I like in the series is Mortal Kombat 2 for the Game Boy.So, I was treated with a rather glorious presentation. The graphics are still really colorful on the Game Boy Advance, and the sound is top-notch. Oh, and there's a huge variety of characters, including the off-beat versions of some of them from MK3. Oh GOD does it fall from there.Since I was new to this particular game, I tried the ""Warrior"" (aka Normal) difficulty. MY BUTT WAS BRUTALLY MURDERED BY SCORPION THE SECOND I CAME IN. Not once did I even inflict damage on him, and I was trying the hardest as possible to even give the tiniest bit of damage!Apparently, I knew I couldn't handle that difficulty. The next logical thing to do was try the ""Novice"" difficulty. After all, that is the easiest difficulty setting available at all, right?Okay...I'm not making this up: It. Didn't. Change. A. Freaking. THING. This game is impossible! It's at the same standards of horrendous as Dragon's Lair on the NES!! Do NOT play this! It's a total waste of money. Avoid it and play something better! Like...MK: Deadly Alliance on the GBA. Same system, totally better game.","""Novice"" mode? Maybe in JAPAN it is."
14426,Nintendo,1,"I thought this would be a great game. To be honest, what would you expect? The graphics look like the SNES Ultimate MK3. Well i've played the crap out of this game and I hate it. Feel free to disagree if you're good at it, but I'm a 15-year MK vet and I know exactly what I'm talking about.The graphics and sound are great. But the music loops mindlessly over and over again, probably to accomodate all the voice files on the game. That can be forgiven. I started my first match, picking Scorpion, and they throw you in a fight against Scorpion. I got my butt handed to me in seconds. So after gaming over at least twice, I went into options menu and put the difficulty on VERY EASY, assuming I would have a chance.I didn't.The game's CPU ambushes you and once you're backed into a corner, you're as good as dead. Sure I was able to use Scorpion's spear from far away about three times, but the contact boxes suck and most projectiles don't connect even when you see that they would. Someone talked about adjusting the handicap, but it only speeds up the ass-kicking, rendering you a sitting duck... or as us MK fans call them, ""noobs"".Bottom line, if you're a collector and you want every single MK game, buy it. But if you're a gamer or an MK fan, or you want to try it out, let me save you from wasting your money: Download a ROM and waste space on your PC if you want to try it so badly, but don't spend one red cent on this waste of plastic. I love Mortal Kombat, but I HATE Mortal Kombat Advance.",The most UNPLAYABLE game ever.

This game is a total disgrace to the Mortal Kombat name.It's basically just Ultimate MK3,but IT IS HORRIBLE! You only got two buttons to work with,along with the d-pad of course,but it is SOOOO HARD!..and as I said,I'm an MK vet.I could not even get past the first fight.All Scorpion did was just block.Every punch or kick I tried to hit him with,he would just block.Another thing.It is almost impossible to pull off a special move.The cpu just kicks your ass,before you even have a chance to attack.Bottom line.This game sucks.You're better off just picking up MKII for the original Gameboy instead.Stay away from this worthless piece of little plastic!!!",Huge Waste Of Time!!!

When they go to the game store to exchange it for a real copy, you will laugh with glee as they find that there was no defect, but it was the real game!  Only use this against a bitter enemy however, as this game is an incredible torture that I would wish upon noone.

15598,Nintendo,2,"WRESTLEMANIA X8Let's be honest, this game is not acceptable by any means.  Whether ir be from a wrestling game point of view, a sports game, fighting game or even a video game in general, it is truly not good at all.  The graphics are sub par, the controls are really bad (even worse, in my opinion, than Psone and N64's WCW Nitro) and the sound is pretty bad too.First off, the graphics.  They're not clean and neat compared to the SMACKDOWN series on PS2.  Each character is barely individual as well.  They just have the clothes and the moves.  Other than that, most of the characters look fairly the same.  And let's not even start on the Create A Wrestler because that is also a pain.  The game itself is surrounded on the ring and the first few rows of ringside seating and nothing else.  What does that mean?  It means, you can only fight in the ring area.  You cannot go into any back areas and going on the stage still looks a little plain.The controls weren't working for me.  I couldn't get it down no matter what I tried.  Plus the motions and movements of each character are a little stiff.  The controls take a little time to get used to.  After some practice, it's not so bad but still, they're a little advanced for younger gamers.Last but not least, the audio is a disaster.  There is no commentary and there are no voices for the wrestlers.  The only sounds I heard were when you hit the mat and the audience noise.  And the some of the wrestler's entrance themes are off.  Perfect example, the New World Order music is not even the real thing.  It's some really bad guitar power chord and riff fusion and I assure you, it sounds bad.Unfortunately, I'd have to say skip this one and wait until the Gamecube gets another WWE game because WRESTLEMANIA X8 won't be worth your money.  Trust me, I had to learn that the hard way.  I bought this game and traded it back in 3 days.  If you're still looking for a wrestling game for Gamecube, check out LEGENDS OF WRESTLING II.  I'm not to fond of that game either but, there are a few improvements to that game.  Again, do yourself a favor and skip WRESTLEMANIA X8.",Wrestlemania X8
15601,Nintendo,2,"I got in the mood to play wrestling games, and it mostly stems from me having a lot of fun with them when I was much younger, and really enjoying them up to about N64, but that was also about the age that I stopped following wrestling, so I don't know many of the new wrestlers, about the time that the WWE was formed as I was much more into ECW and WCW.  Anyways, I got this game and I have to say that it just feels like it was rushed to marked on some sort of deadline, but without the team behind it that many big sports games like madden have, and I can't help but feel like if the developers had just put some more time into it, then it could have been at least something.  From what I understand, this was a really big wrestlemania, and it makes sense that they would want a video game tie in.  I have to say that since I am not as familiar with many of the names as some of the other reviewers, the game just doesn't look very good.  There is a lot of footage mixed in, which always signals to me that they had to put something there since the actual graphics are much to be desired.  There really isn't much of a story mode, and the create a wrestler features here are a joke, and the most important part of any wrestling game, the way that you actually fight, well the controls and the point just suck.  There is no other way to put it.  The matches just feel aimless.  Easily the worst wrestling game on the market.

15607,Nintendo,1,"Before I begin this review, I'm not going to pick on anyone else's review on Amazon, but I will state that this is my personal opinion of the abomination that is Wrestlemania X8.Here's my review-Graphics-The graphics for this game aren't the best; and there's no excuse being that the majority of Gamecube games have excellent graphics. Still, I'm at least able to say the wrestler models are smooth, and the framerate is consistent, but man o' man are the graphics buggy and collision detection is truly crap. In fact, most wrestlers lack detail altogether and look about as generic as possible. The arenas themselves are decent at best and looks very crisp with clean textures, however, the crowd looks about as bad as it can get which would be a giant block of humanity flattened and displayed at 2-frame loops.Nothing special to talk about here. The wrestlers don't sell moves, generally do not look hurt and aren't exactly too accurate in size. Generic, boring graphics galore.Sound-One redeeming quality of Wrestlemania X8 would be the sound...and that's as far as music goes because the sound effects are muffled and bad. The music is really good. Each theme is accurate and a lot better than I anticipated. Just don't expect much when you hit a wrestler or slam them other than a light slapping noise or a muffled thud.There's no commentary which really sucks. I often wondered why WWE games for Gamecube couldn't have commentary when Ultimate Muscle- Legends vs new generation for Gamecube does.Gameplay-Here's the really bad part, as if the sound and graphics weren't bad enough, in comes the incredibly boring gameplay.Westlemania X8 does feature a decent enough roster, but the moves are limited and that's the main problem with this game. The movesets given to each wrestler is about 5 or so moves, a finisher, running attacks, standing attacks and some ground attacks. On paper, this wouldn't be bad, but considering every wrestler has the same bodyslam, suplex, as well as other moves shows just how much this game truly sucks. Even the smaller wrestlers movesets are about the same with minor exceptions.The match types wouldn't be bad if this game was better. You get single, tag team, TLC, Hell in a Cell, Cage, Rumble, Handicap and some other match types.The roster could've been really good, but the graphics are so bad that I could truly care less who's featured in this game. The roster consists of- The Hardy Boys, Rob Van Dam, Hulk Hogan, The Rock, Stone cold steve austin, Triple H, Undertaker, Kane and a few others. There are about 40 some odd wrestlers plus some unlockables. But the one thing that truly pissed me off was the fact that this game had the NWO in it and is such a crappy game.

15610,Nintendo,1,"Fans of the N64 wrestling game series waited long for a next-gen successor to take Nintendo to the next level of sports entertainement.  They will have to keep waiting.Wrestlemania X8 sports what feels very much like Smackdown,  but lacks many of the features the Smackdown series made it big for.  The Create a Wrestler (CAW) system,  while creating smooth wrestlers,  is very limited.  Here's a rundown:Graphics:  The graphics are great in some places,  but are inconsistant.  While some wreslters look very much like their counterparts,  many don't.  The movements onscreen are rather jerky and don't quite line up.  It's a step up from previous Nintendo platform games,  but nothing for a next gen system.Sound:  The only complaint I've come up with so far,  from myself or others is that the levels are a bit low.  If cranking your stereo or TV up a couple of notches is the only problem,  you're pretty much standing on solid ground.  The sound does indeed need some extra volume,  but is otherwise excellent.Controls:  The controls are clumsy and unintuitive.  While they're not impossible to manage,  many commands double for mulptiple things you might attempt to do in the same circumstances.  The instruction manual is horribly organized for attempting to find what buttons you hit to perform what.Gameplay:  Well,  this is what matters in a wrestling game.  Controls,  as mentioned above,  are unintuitive,  but responsive at the very least.  Timing seems less important in this game,  compared to other titles.The moveset is incredibly limited.  No Mercy had 16 different grapple moves per wrestler (Counting only front grapples for simplicity in this review),  Smackdown had ten,  WM X8 has 5. The selection of grapple options is pretty limited too.Pre-release hype pointed to slower,  more realistic gameplay,  and better &quot;selling&quot; of moves (Selling refers to taking the move and making it look good).  The gameplay is slower than the mindless funger numbing pound-any-button-and-win frenzy of smackdown,  but win strategies are still pretty limited.  As for the &quot;sell time,&quot;  expect your opponents to stay down only a little longer after a Twist of Fate or Stone Cold Stunner than if they had been nailed with an Eye rake or Fireman Carry.The grappling is also a holdover from Smackdown.  What is there of No Mercy in this game,  as we were promised?  Not much.  Attacks to the groin give a &quot;ding&quot; sound,  and the countering system uses a foundation based off of No Mercy.  However,  whereas there were dozens of possible counters,  including varied reversals for heavyweights,  light heavyweights,  an martial artists,  there is usually only one reversal to a move,  and most are shared among many,  many moves.  Finishers can be reversed,  however.Among the good are a wide variety of matches,  every sort of match your little heart could desire,  provided it makes a showing on WWF/E TV.  HEll in a Cell,  Cage,  Tornado Tag,  etc.To summarize the gameplay,  it plays like a cheesy arcade game.  In the early nineties,  we moved away from this kind of game for just that reason.  It's return is unwelcome,  and its demise will not be mourned.Create a Wreslter:  Sadly,  the CAW works like the Smackdown series,  without the benefit of all the options.  Selections are limited and hardly sufficient for coming up with a wrestler that is anything more than a hodge podge of the current pop favorites.  The CAW system from Smackdowns 2 and 3 was a huge selling point,  even to people disappointed with the gameplay.  This is but a pale imitation of better systems.Wrestlemania X8 has remained a fairly big disappointment.  Some will enjoy this title,  but I'd suggest renting it,  even if you are a fan of the Smackdown series and this review has done nothing to sway you.",Smackdown Junior?  Anything but No Mercy's successor
15615,Nintendo,2,"WRESTLEMANIA X8Let's be honest, this game is not acceptable by any means.  Whether ir be from a wrestling game point of view, a sports game, fighting game or even a video game in general, it is truly not good at all.  The graphics are sub par, the controls are really bad (even worse, in my opinion, than Psone and N64's WCW Nitro) and the sound is pretty bad too.First off, the graphics.  They're not clean and neat compared to the SMACKDOWN series on PS2.  Each character is barely individual as well.  They just have the clothes and the moves.  Other than that, most of the characters look fairly the same.  And let's not even start on the Create A Wrestler because that is also a pain.  The game itself is surrounded on the ring and the first few rows of ringside seating and nothing else.  What does that mean?  It means, you can only fight in the ring area.  You cannot go into any back areas and going on the stage still looks a little plain.The controls weren't working for me.  I couldn't get it down no matter what I tried.  Plus the motions and movements of each character are a little stiff.  The controls take a little time to get used to.  After some practice, it's not so bad but still, they're a little advanced for younger gamers.Last but not least, the audio is a disaster.  There is no commentary and there are no voices for the wrestlers.  The only sounds I heard were when you hit the mat and the audience noise.  And the some of the wrestler's entrance themes are off.  Perfect example, the New World Order music is not even the real thing.  It's some really bad guitar power chord and riff fusion and I assure you, it sounds bad.Unfortunately, I'd have to say skip this one and wait until the Gamecube gets another WWE game because WRESTLEMANIA X8 won't be worth your money.  Trust me, I had to learn that the hard way.  I bought this game and traded it back in 3 days.  If you're still looking for a wrestling game for Gamecube, check out LEGENDS OF WRESTLING II.  I'm not to fond of that game either but, there are a few improvements to that game.  Again, do yourself a favor and skip WRESTLEMANIA X8.",Wrestlemania X8
15618,Nintendo,2,"I got in the mood to play wrestling games, and it mostly stems from me having a lot of fun with them when I was much younger, and really enjoying them up to about N64, but that was also about the age that I stopped following wrestling, so I don't know many of the new wrestlers, about the time that the WWE was formed as I was much more into ECW and WCW.  Anyways, I got this game and I have to say that it just feels like it was rushed to marked on some sort of deadline, but without the team behind it that many big sports games like madden have, and I can't help but feel like if the developers had just put some more time into it, then it could have been at least something.  From what I understand, this was a really big wrestlemania, and it makes sense that they would want a video game tie in.  I have to say that since I am not as familiar with many of the names as some of the other reviewers, the game just doesn't look very good.  There is a lot of footage mixed in, which always signals to me that they had to put something there since the actual graphics are much to be desired.  There really isn't much of a story mode, and the create a wrestler features here are a joke, and the most important part of any wrestling game, the way that you actually fight, well the controls and the point just suck.  There is no other way to put it.  The matches just feel aimless.  Easily the worst wrestling game on the market.  Sure thee are lots of different kinds of matches and a couple of cool features, but maybe they should have focused on just getting the first one right and going from there.  Avoid at all costs.",Rushed

The game has been developed by Yukes, who did the Smackdown series on PS1 &amp; 2' &amp; while it looks very impressive when running on demo, it's awful to play. No story modes, no interference, a lack of some characters real theme tunes, a criminal lack of moves &amp; the worst blocking system in the history of gaming. It plays like a very rushed, unfinished game, &amp; is simply no fun to play at all. Avoid like the plague.",Wrestlemania diaster
15624,Nintendo,1,"Before I begin this review, I'm not going to pick on anyone else's review on Amazon, but I will state that this is my personal opinion of the abomination that is Wrestlemania X8.Here's my review-Graphics-The graphics for this game aren't the best; and there's no excuse being that the majority of Gamecube games have excellent graphics. Still, I'm at least able to say the wrestler models are smooth, and the framerate is consistent, but man o' man are the graphics buggy and collision detection is truly crap. In fact, most wrestlers lack detail altogether and look about as generic as possible. The arenas themselves are decent at best and looks very crisp with clean textures, however, the crowd looks about as bad as it can get which would be a giant block of humanity flattened and displayed at 2-frame loops.Nothing special to talk about here. The wrestlers don't sell moves, generally do not look hurt and aren't exactly too accurate in size. Generic, boring graphics galore.Sound-One redeeming quality of Wrestlemania X8 would be the sound...and that's as far as music goes because the sound effects are muffled and bad. The music is really good. Each theme is accurate and a lot better than I anticipated. Just don't expect much when you hit a wrestler or slam them other than a light slapping noise or a muffled thud.There's no commentary which really sucks. I often wondered why WWE games for Gamecube couldn't have commentary when Ultimate Muscle- Legends vs new generation for Gamecube does.Gameplay-Here's the really bad part, as if the sound and graphics weren't bad enough, in comes the incredibly boring gameplay.Westlemania X8 does feature a decent enough roster, but the moves are limited and that's the main problem with this game. The movesets given to each wrestler is about 5 or so moves, a finisher, running attacks, standing attacks and some ground attacks. On paper, this wouldn't be bad, but considering every wrestler has the same bodyslam, suplex, as well as other moves shows just how much this game truly sucks. Even the smaller wrestlers movesets are about the same with minor exceptions.The match types wouldn't be bad if this game was better. You get single, tag team, TLC, Hell in a Cell, Cage, Rumble, Handicap and some other match types.The roster could've been really good, but the graphics are so bad that I could truly care less who's featured in this game. The roster consists of- The Hardy Boys, Rob Van Dam, Hulk Hogan, The Rock, Stone cold steve austin, Triple H, Undertaker, Kane and a few others. There are about 40 some odd wrestlers plus some unlockables. But the one thing that truly pissed me off was the fact that this game had the NWO in it and is such a crappy game. I can't stress it any more how much you should stay away from this game. Bad controls, collision detection problems, bad graphics, limited engine, and so many more screwups makes this title only worth owning if you intend on buying the entire series of wrestling games like myself. If you're a collector, get it, if not avoid this one. It's literally the worst wrestling game of the 6th gen and possibly ever ranking alongside such failures like WCW Nitro, WCW thunder and the abysmal WCW BACKSTAGE Assault.WCW Vs.

15774,Nintendo,2,"If you are thinking of buying this product because of the fact that it contains Star Fox, then don't get this game.Star Fox games have always been about flying, and fantastic flying games they have been!The original Star Fox for the SNES was the master of graphics in its day, and had three short-ish paths that could be taken to the final level. You had to play that game all at one time however, so it wasn' t bad at all.Star Fox 64 was also on the top side of graphics in ITS day, but that wasn't what made it sell. It was fun, it was a great flying game, and there is not really a game out there that can stand up to a Star Fox flying game, though Star Fox games may be different.Star Fox Adventures, the first star fox for the gamecube, is basically a complete wreck of the series. The whole game is ON THE GROUND. Though this has never been seen in a Star Fox game, that's ALL THERE WAS in this game. No flying, no anything that made previous Star Fox games Star Fox games.The puzzles were slightly boring, and for all Star Fox veterans, there was no skill that they could bring back.If you want a Star Fox game for Gamecube, get Star Fox Assault. The ground levels are better and there is a great deal of flying (including that the whole last level, which consists of 4 stages, is all flying). Staf Fox Assault, great game. Star Fox Adventures, not Star Fox.",This is not Star Fox
15783,Nintendo,2,"Very simple.  This game tries to be Zelda, but it isn't.  No, this game is not a shooter like the two previous Starfox games.  This is a 3rd person adventure game with some platforming thrown in.  True, there are some classic Starfox shooting sequences, but they are very short, and resemble a minigame more than anything else.As a game all by itself, it just isn't good.  Like I said, it tries to be Zelda, but it isn't.  There are no interesting dungeons or worlds.  Most quests involve fetching something, bring it back, fetch something else, find someone, find something else.......  (headache ensues).  Not fun.Then there's combat which is a matter of mashing the big green A button until the bad guy is dead.  That's all there is to it.  There is an alternate attack if you hold back on the analog stick, and Starfox twirls his stick around, but it actually does less damage, so it's ultimately pointless.The only redeeming aspect of this game are the graphics.  They are stunning in general, and are 2nd best I've seen for the platforming genre (First goes to Conker Live and Reloaded for the xbox, but Kameo for the Xbox 360 probably looks better).  But, obviously graphics mean little when the gameplay sucks.  They mean even less when you realize that graphics become outdated in a year or two (as I already stated, Conker looks better now).I will admit however that some may like the game.  Suprisingly a lot of reviews rate this game in the 8.x range.  So rent it if you are really interested in it and decide for yourself.",A bad addition to an excellent series

15837,Nintendo,2,"If you are thinking of buying this product because of the fact that it contains Star Fox, then don't get this game.Star Fox games have always been about flying, and fantastic flying games they have been!The original Star Fox for the SNES was the master of graphics in its day, and had three short-ish paths that could be taken to the final level. You had to play that game all at one time however, so it wasn' t bad at all.Star Fox 64 was also on the top side of graphics in ITS day, but that wasn't what made it sell. It was fun, it was a great flying game, and there is not really a game out there that can stand up to a Star Fox flying game, though Star Fox games may be different.Star Fox Adventures, the first star fox for the gamecube, is basically a complete wreck of the series. The whole game is ON THE GROUND. Though this has never been seen in a Star Fox game, that's ALL THERE WAS in this game. No flying, no anything that made previous Star Fox games Star Fox games.The puzzles were slightly boring, and for all Star Fox veterans, there was no skill that they could bring back.If you want a Star Fox game for Gamecube, get Star Fox Assault. The ground levels are better and there is a great deal of flying (including that the whole last level, which consists of 4 stages, is all flying). Staf Fox Assault, great game. Star Fox Adventures, not Star Fox.",This is not Star Fox
15846,Nintendo,2,"Very simple.  This game tries to be Zelda, but it isn't.  No, this game is not a shooter like the two previous Starfox games.  This is a 3rd person adventure game with some platforming thrown in.  True, there are some classic Starfox shooting sequences, but they are very short, and resemble a minigame more than anything else.As a game all by itself, it just isn't good.  Like I said, it tries to be Zelda, but it isn't.  There are no interesting dungeons or worlds.  Most quests involve fetching something, bring it back, fetch something else, find someone, find something else.......  (headache ensues).  Not fun.Then there's combat which is a matter of mashing the big green A button until the bad guy is dead.  That's all there is to it.  There is an alternate attack if you hold back on the analog stick, and Starfox twirls his stick around, but it actually does less damage, so it's ultimately pointless.The only redeeming aspect of this game are the graphics.  They are stunning in general, and are 2nd best I've seen for the platforming genre (First goes to Conker Live and Reloaded for the xbox, but Kameo for the Xbox 360 probably looks better).  But, obviously graphics mean little when the gameplay sucks.  They mean even less when you realize that graphics become outdated in a year or two (as I already stated, Conker looks better now).I will admit however that some may like the game.  Suprisingly a lot of reviews rate this game in the 8.x range.  So rent it if you are really interested in it and decide for yourself.",A bad addition to an excellent series

    Nintendo",2,"Super Mario Sunshine is now considered the weak point of all the big name Mario titles, and for good reason- it's really lousy in several key areas.  Almost all of them in fact.  For those of you that grew up with the 2D Mario games, this game will feel lifeless and dramatically different in comparison.  For those of you who approached Mario with the Galaxy series... you'll have the same reaction.  The lowest point of the Mario series is Super Mario Sunshine, unquestionably.Let's name all the problems-The entire theme of the game, with the exception of a few platform-dominated missions underground along with a ghost house maze area, is based around the beach.  The ONE environment that feels totally out of place for a Mario game (the beach) and Nintendo actually thought it would be a good idea to roll with it.  REALLY disappointing.  I'm totally used to the Mushroom Kingdom by this point and expected as such.  I'm pretty sure most Mario fans feel the same way.  Incredibly disappointing that Nintendo abandoned the Mushroom Kingdom for something so generic.  Nintendo should have executed a beach theme only occasionally like how it's properly done in Yoshi's Island and Super Mario Galaxy, and then added more diverse locations for the other 90% of the game because the way it stands now, the beach is seriously overkill.  Not to mention all the yucky beach music that makes me sick after a while.  Variety is a key component of the Mario series.It's pretty sad that the underground platform jumping missions are the high point of the game because jumping on platforms is normally a chore in 3D Mario, having to line up and carefully execute well-timed jumps.  It's awful.  Platform jumping was awful in Super Mario 64 but at least the environments in that game are a tad nicer/more diverse than the overdone beach theme here.  Eventually you arrive to platforms that either disappear or square shaped cube-like rotating platforms that are unique the first time you deal with these, but ultimately adds more to the frustration factor instead of actually being fun or adding anything to the replayability.  The only time these platform missions become somewhat entertaining is when you have to collect 8 red coins with a timer requiring the player to move swiftly.  These are challenging and fun.Mario has a spray nozzle and a rocket nozzle.  The spray nozzle is a horrible idea because the object is to fill up with water at every available opportunity and spray most of the bosses until they die, which is clearly NOT what makes many of the other games in the Mario series so incredibly fun to play.  Absolutely no way.  Basically you spray bosses until they die while dodging attacks.  Sometimes this is hard when the surrounding danger gets intense, but most of the time it's painfully easy.  The rocket nozzle is slightly improved however, because this allows you to launch into the sky really high and reach the platforms that would otherwise be impossible to reach.My least favorite part of the game is a 5-way tie.1- the lifeless, empty and boring levels with hardly any enemies or exciting powerups anywhere.  Trees, beaches, water, tightropes, platforms, rinse and repeat.  For 10-20 hours.  God...2- the ""collect 100 coins to get a shine"" missions (the shines are the same thing as the stars found in SM64 and the Galaxy series by the way).  Several of these missions, namely that one God awful watermelon-pushing stage, takes FOREVER to obtain 100 stars.  If thoroughly exploring lifeless environments is supposed to qualify as fun and the reason many Mario fans make such a big deal about open world exploration, count me out.  Collecting these stars means Nintendo is FORCING me to explore these generic and boring environments.  Nooo way.3- having to go back to the *same exact stages over and over again* to search for/obtain MORE shines.  Where's the darn level variety?!?!?  Maintaining a beach theme is bad enough, but at least make each stage *different* for crying out loud.  Come on Nintendo, Super Mario Sunshine isn't progress- it's a kick in the rear-end.4- collecting over 200 boring blue coins, many of which can be found by spraying water on these X's located on walls that you will often stumble upon.  The reward for collecting so many of these bland blue coins isn't exciting for the player in the end so expect the highest level of disappointment imaginable.  Collecting blue coins ends up being a needless chore not only because the reward is underwhelming, but because the concept itself is unexceptional.  No real desire or motivation to obtain them.5- the overworld I guess you can say, where you spend a good chunk of your time throughout the ""adventure"", is nothing but generic buildings disguised as MORE generic platform jumping with ugly characters everywhere.  How horrendous.Oh and the storyline?  Mario goes to jail?  Give me a break.  Never *ever* attempt to implement storyline bits in a Mario platformer.  The ""princess is kidnapped/kill Bowser"" storyline is pretty weak admittedly, but honestly that's *all* we need.  Don't even think about making a story anymore elaborate than that or it will fail, which is why Super Mario Sunshine's story fails so miserably.I highly recommend skipping this game.","yup a 2, wow this is awful"

Though the graphics and sound are far superior to the ones seen in the old days (despite the strange shading,) the game itself has suffered.First off, the game is marginally insulting if taken allegorically.  The people of Isle Delphino seem like nothing more than a spoof on Americans.  Loud, annoying, overweight, coming in a variety of &quot;strange&quot; colors and completely unable to solve their own problems.  Just the kind of things a Japanese man would mock about America, especially since Isle Delphino bears a more than passing resemblance to Hawaii.But more importantly, the game's summary reads like your laundry list of afternoon chores.  Mario's gameplay used to revolve around &quot;Get the Fireball Power, Kill the Bad Guy, Invade the Castle, Save the Princess, etc...&quot;  Now, it's &quot;Water the Plant, Save the Animal, Clean the Wall, etc...&quot;This is, by and large, a problem that ALL recent Nintendo games (except Metroid Prime, of course,) have suffered from.

This game is terrible compared to 3d platforming excellence like Jak & Daxter or Sly Cooper.  Considering how much precision the game requires, the lack of practical precision the game gives you in the controls is infuriating (more on that later).  The camera is awful, constantly having to be managed by you to get anywhere, and it DOES NOT SEE THROUGH WALLS.  I cannot believe how pissed the camera made me, giving me a fullscreen of wall during times requiring precision.  Oh, and the ""B"" button is both the talk and dive button, so if you were trying to talk to someone, but the talk context icon didn't pop-up quick enough, prepare to enjoy flinging yourself off cliffs.  Mario also does not respond well to surfaces he can wall jump or slide on;  If you hit the wall too smoothly for example, he won't wall-slide down it, he'll simply fall straight down as if there's no wall at all.  If you are falling downwards, it's extremely difficult to fall only a little bit forward, you often wind up overshooting your mark because the controls don't allow for fine movement unless you move the joystick at .1 mm at a time.  When you are dealing with disappering blocks, you don't have time for that kind of fine movement, but anything more than that ultrafine joystick movement sends mario running too far.The game also almost never tells you what you are supposed to do next, nor does it give any hints.  I've had to consult a FAQ many times simply because I didn't understand what I had to do next in a mission, or even where I had to go to get to the next ""world"".The most important jump in the game, the 180 degree high jump, also does not reliably work.  If you are moving in one direction, your jump height is actually kind of small.  In order to get decent air, you have to move in one direction for a half second, and then do a 180 and move the other direction and press jump.  Problem is, this jump does not reliably happen.  It works most of the time, but again it is extremely frustrating when it doesn't work at key moments, and you wind up doing a crappy normal jump instead.Another, more minor quibble is that there is no option to invert/un-invert the camera y-axis or x-axis.  Nintendo chose to make the camera inverted, and you're stuck with it.  I got used to it after 2 hours, but man was it annoying.  How hard is it to program camera inversion???This game has disgusted me so much that I've lost any interest in picking up the Mario Galaxy games, since they are 3D mario platformers as well.

16985,Nintendo,1,"I can't believe this game was released. Normally a game like Mickey Mouse I would think would be fun at ANY age! I love disney movies and such. This was painful. It looks like on the box, you use Mickey to walk around and gather coins. Instead you have a hand that you point everywhere. It takes getting used to and that's even questionable. Gets boring FAST. I can't imagine a child figuring this out. Neat story poor execution. I think if you could control Mickey without the pointy finger curser it'd be a lot better!His little &#34;hmmm&#34; every 3 secs gets old and annoying. It's the only thing he really says other then an &#34;okay!&#34;  Glad I didn't pay much!",Lose interest quickly...
16987,Nintendo,1,"Seansp, time out... kids wont like that word, you got to be kidding me. Anyway anyone who says this game is for children and bought and were not happy,is obvius we are talking about Mickey Mouse Game not resident evil... so if you dont like silly, stupid, easy games dont buy this one.... PROXIMO!",n.d.a
16989,Nintendo,1,"I bought this game for my 5 year old triplets.  The cursor doesn't always respond well, and is very frustrating.  The games ""childrens mode"" is actually more frustrating than the normal mode, as it doesn't have the hint icon.  The game occasionally plays a cartoon for up to 5 minutes that you cannot move past until it finishes, which frustrated my kids and myself to no end.  The childrens mode sometimes moves automatically, and sometimes goes to the same rooms over and over again.  The ""ghost"" terrifies my kids.  We all strongly dislike this game, very very frustrating on all levels.  A total waste of $40.",Not fun at any age!

Then I guess this is the game for you . But I dont think small kids need to see game animals act so bratty . I would also like to know why so many of the girl animals seem so stuck up and obsessed with there looks ? I think the game was made by a guys . I also found it anoying that the store was closed so much of the time .The game is O.K. but slow and my kids hated it . Also to the reviewer that said there 3 year old can play because the game was mostly icons . That is just not true you have to read all the time and write letters . But when you get letters back they will tell you that you are hard to under stand or you just are dumb.  If you just want to kill time then play .

    Nintendo",2,"What happens when you find yourself trapped in a world where animals can speak? Animal Crossing is that world. Animal Crossing offers some of the most innovative game play Nintendo has to offer, but was very poorly executed.Animal Crossing is a neat, little game where you enter a town run by animals. The animals CAN speak English. Believe it or not, Nintendo actually programmed the game to phonetically sound out everything being said. This means that if you close your eyes, you can still understand the dialog, even though it has been sped up to the speed of the Alvin, Simon, and Theodore. All the animals talk like this, with various tonal differences. Ivan the Russian bear speaks with a deep voice, while the Cat (I do not remember her name) speaks in a high pitched voice. This is called Animalese. Animalese is great because of the phonetic speech, but can become quickly annoying.  There is also a silent voice, where text just appears and an option where you get the standard beep tone every time a word appears on-screen. For the duration of my play, I left it on Animalese, to see if Nintendo kept the speech  consistent through the game. Believe it or not, they did.The game has an interesting beginning. Before you see your character, you are asked questions by a cat on a train. The cat will ask you your name, which becomes the name you will be addressed by through out the game. Then you are asked what you think of your name. By answering ""It is a good name"", the cat assumes you are a boy. Alternatively, by answering ""It is a cute name"", the cat thinks you are a girl. You then receive a chance to correct the cat if he guesses your gender incorrectly because of the option you chose. Once you exit the train, a Raccoon named Tom Nook will show you to a group of four houses. These houses are possible starting points for you. Once you select a house, the Raccoon tells you that you owe him for the house. At this point, you spend most of your time paying for the house, rather than having fun. Initially, you begin paying for your house by running errands for Nook. He then sets you free to find your own way of running errands. You must pay Nook at least 1000 bells (bells is the currency) a week. If you do not like being indebt, get used to it in this game.The real fun begins, once Tom Nook sets you loose. You have more time to explore the town. Nintendo had the foresight to employ the Game Cube's internal clock to have an effect on play. The game is in real time, and stuff changes even while you are not playing, though, you should not leave your Game Cube on all day and night. The townsfolk have their set schedules that they follow. Most of them stay near their houses in the night hours, but may walk the town during the day time. Even the post office changes clerks, depending on the time you are playing the game. You must also remember to not play the game too long. If you keep interacting with the townsfolk all day and all night, they will not get their much needed sleep and will tend to be very curt with you the next time you turn on your Game Cube. This can be very amusing, but upset neighbors can really impede your progress.The environments are well  portrayed. Overall, Nintendo kept a child-like feel to Animal Crossing. The graphics are simple and the environments are easy to navigate. The size of the town is rather small, so depending on your preference, this can either be a positive or a negative to the overall game. I am personally pleased with the ability to customize the inside of your house, though you spend so little time inside, that it becomes as useless as the room feature in Pok&eacute;mon G/S. My only issue with the towns is when you are running errands, sometimes, you need to run from one end, to the exact opposite end of the town. This not only takes time, but can get tedious.Animal Crossing supports the Gameboy Advance E-Reader. With the E-Reader, you can add furniture and other items to your inventory. This is a neat idea. Personally, I enjoy little antics and innovations like this, but in Animal Crossing, you can even swipe the E-Reader classic games and be able to play them on your Nintendo (if you buy one from Tom Nook). The E-Reader cards are an incurred cost (as you actually have to go out an buy them), but prove to be more like the Pok&eacute;mon Trading Card game, short lived.I found Animal Crossing to be a very repetitive game. You spend most of your time running errands and interacting with the townspeople. This tends to get very repetitive. If I wanted to work on my relationships with others, I would play The Sims  (PC and PS2) by Electronic Arts. As for the Gameboy Advance E-Reader interaction, I find this to be a more costly expense than it is worth. In all seriousness, who really wants to go out and spend more money on cards that they will only use for Animal Crossing, then throw away when they get rid of their Nintendo Game Cube? My largest complaint about Animal Crossing is that by the time I got a shovel, I could not use it the way I wanted. If I could have, the town's population would drop to 1, and there would be dirt mounds near each villager's house.Overall, Animal Crossing finds the same replay value as Harvest Moon. You either enjoy the repetition, or you hate it. Because of its simple nature, I can see Animal Crossing appealing to players under 12.  For more intelligent players or players who do not work in factories, I recommend staying away from this game. Needless to say, I did not like Animal Crossing.",Find yourself trapped in redundancy

All the townsfolk are animals, and the player is a strange looking boy or girl.Now the GC is known for the &quot;kiddy&quot; games, and this dosen't help it.

It is usually a cheezy piano song, or the &quot;town song&quot; which you can change to whatever you want. I feel the the SFX are overly used, but that's just me.Now for the biggie, the FUN FACTOR. You've probably all heard that there are a TON of things to do, and you can't really beat the game, just keep playing. Lots of things to do sounds good, right? Not in this game. You get to town and are 18,000 &quot;bells&quot; in debt for your house the size of a small cubicle. I paid this off in about 1-2 hrs. Then you can make your house bigger, and get another 148,000 bells in debt. Collect shells and fruit, and you'll pay it off in no time. Then a few new options open up. You can buy a bug net and a fishing pole and a shovel. You can fish, collect bugs, and dig up fossils, and sometimes bags of money. You can either sell your captured insects and fish to the store, or donate then to the town hall. Sounds fun? Not really. Fun for an hour or two, and then catching bugs and fishing can get boring, fast. I rented this for free as a promotion from Blockbuster(thank God) instead of buying it. I'm glad. After you finally get debt-free you can collect things, find fossils, and fish and hunt bugs, and THAT'S ABOUT IT.

This game is much worse than games that are so boring or easy that you sleep while you play through them.  It is indeed torturous because of the noises that the animals make while they talk, so that you cannot sleep through the game while you play it.  The answer to this problem is simply do not play it.

    Nintendo",2,"My title for this review pretty much says it all.  The overall design of the game is very creative and imaginative and it's definitely not your everyday FPS.  The 3-D environment is huge and offers plenty of opportunities to explore, but the actual game play itself simply becomes torture after a while.First of all, let's discuss the enemies you encounter along the way.  For various reasons, you find yourself having to pass through completed areas again and again, but when you defeat an enemy and clear out an area, it's all for naught, as the next time you pass through the area, they have completely respawned and you have to do it all over again.  This becomes tiresome and repetitive very quickly.The game does not have a quick save or ""save at any point"" feature, however it does have ""save rooms"" scattered throughout the game.  The trouble is, the save room is often some distance away from the boss battles, and if you've defeated by a boss, you find yourself having to repeat a bunch of tedious game play  just to get back to the boss.The bosses in this game simply get ridiculously hard fairly quick, and after about 4 or 5 battles it becomes a real nightmare.  There is this one battle were you have to use your cannon or missiles to flip a series of mirrors off of the boss, and of course the whole time the boss is trying to kill you  AND the boss is flipping the mirrors back, undoing all your work.  And if this wasn't bad enough, you have to complete  this process not once, not twice, but ultimately 4 times.  That's not fun, it's torture.Metroid Prime is creative, imaginative, and definitely a different experience than your standard shoot'em up but the game play is so tortuous it completely ruins the experience.  The sad part is, with just a little tinkering, such as a quick save feature,  enemies that don't respawn, and less complicated boss battles, this game would have deserved the hype it gets.",Imaginative design &amp; concept spoiled by poor  game play

I have not played any of the prior Metroid games so I came at this one with a clean slate.  But I'm just not finding this game fun.  Maybe I'm just not the kind of guy that enjoys walking around in a robot suit, I don't know.The controls are not natural to me.  As you play, you switch visors which changes what the controls do.  With the scanning visor, the center of your view will allow you to lock on to an item and it will tell you what it is.  But sometimes you have to hold R, then look around, then press L (while holding R and moving the stick) to find out what something is.  The combat visor is similar, you can lock on to shoot with L, but sometimes it won't work so you have to hold R and use the stick to look around, then hit L, then fire.  Then sometimes you hold L to lock on, then move the stick while hitting B to dash around, and sometimes you hold L then move around in a circle while jumping, and.... I could go on here but I think you get the idea.I find it difficult to figure out what I'm supposed to do.  On the first boss, after you kill it you have some amount of time to get out before the deck explodes only it took me forever to figure out that you have to scramble up the rubble to exit.  It was difficult to see that the environment had changed.Sometimes you have to traverse levels many times running from point A to point B to get something you need to open the door at point A.  Or you get to the end not collecting what you need and find yourself combing back through the level to figure out what you missed.  Or you see something you want but can't get it because you don't have the right weapon or ball yet - you just know you have to come back for it.  Instead of feeling adventurous it comes off as repetitive to me.I am somewhat sensitive to motion sickness and find that this is one of those games that does it to me.  It is funny how I can play Quake III without getting queasy but this game definitely does it to me.  So beware if you are sensitive to stuff like that.On the plus side the graphics are really spectacular, and once the game begins there are no noticeable pauses for load times which is great.

    Nintendo",2,"Gonna get my metroid on yea...roll under that wreckage, shoot that bad guy...jump that ledge, bomb that false wall....backtrack 5 miles, wait wait wait, what?Yea, you backtrack alot.If you guys have ever played winback, that game where the objective is to backtrack half the time, this game outdoes even winback.Ok so the game is basically a first person shooter. It is linear, There are seperate paths you can go, but you usually will have to stop shortly after because you need a special gizmo or gadget.You don't really need to scan that much to win, even though in the first level they make it seem like you will. Basically you shoot monsters, find things to make your suit do more, and fight bosses for those things, then backtrack.The game has alot of shooting, contrary to what other people say. You will shoot alot of monsters by rapidly clicking the powerbeam button. Eventually, I just started using missles, because every time you kill a guy he leaves something. Well, they don't always leave things, but usually they will leave a health up or missle up. I think it depends on what weapon you use to kill the actual monster.The pros of the game are the great environments. It isn't the same over and over again, actually the backtracking screws that up. You could of gone through tons of different environments, instead you backtrack between like 5 of them, mabye 6. Then there are the graphics, pretty good. The weapons are alright, I love just pounding guys with missles. The morph ball works well, you can use it whenever you want. Then there is the help system. Usually it tells you when there is a save system nearby, and your next objective. Most of the time I am not lost, but sometimes it tells me to go 5 miles to where I just came from and I feel like throwing the game in the garbage.However, the cons of the game greatly out-due all the good things. The control is weird at first, but once you master it, it becomes better. Still, there are points in the game when the control works against you. Say there is a monster shootiong at you from behind. You can't really turn around and keep moving left and right, so you usually will get shot a couple times. Cleared areas usually leave some really tough enemies, that gang up on you and you die. That's another problem, the monsters can be really tough. Usually you can't just shoot the monsters. Most of the time you will have to find a weakness or wait till it turns around and shoot it's back.The overall layout of the game is even worst. Boss, new item, backtrack. You will probably fight 20 bosses in the game. You can get a few energy cell boosters, and missle pack boosters. The only thing is, most of them require you to go out of your way for them. Backtracking isn't that big during the first hour or so of the game, but let me tell you something, it gets worse. You go to this iceworld to get a speed ball reward, then you go ALL THE WAY BACK to your ship. If you play the game and get to the speed ball part, you will know what I am talking about.Besides backtracking and such, the problem is death. Die, reload from last save point saved at. The one problem that could of been avoided easily. Say you get killed? Ok, you can't just continue from the beggining of that boss fight, you are going to have to reload. Say you fight some of the tough enemies, reload. Say you play for 2 hours to get a powerup then die, reload. I think you understand.In closing, the backtracking makes the game bad. The dieing makes the game bad. I wouldn't of minded a shorter game with no backtracking. I wouldn't have minded a retry system for bosses. But these problems overshadow all the good things in the game, and make it not worth playing. Sorry metroid, better luck next time.Overall---&gt;2 Starsn&dagger; good",Two problems that could of been avoided stand prominent.

If it weren't for the shoddy control and ridiculous save points, I would be sharing the opinions of every reviewer out there and say this game is a 5 out of 5 or a 9.5 out of 10 like IGN. Unfortunately, cool graphics, a great map, wonderful environments, super smooth 60FPS and a compelling story does not make up for the fact that you will be fighting the godawful controls all the way through.Admittedly , this game is from 2002--which would be the infancy of first person shooters on Consoles. This hardly excuses not using the damn second stick on the Gamecube controller to make this game livable!! Sure, the left trigger locks on which is great to straff and blast through enemies. The problem comes when you have to shoot at things which the game does not consider enemies--like exploding mushrooms, or that rapidly respawning killer grass, or the hives where those big flying bugs come out of. AIming is nearly impossible!! You hold the right trigger and try to move the left stick(the only stick used for control in this game) praying beyond everything that the damn reticule will stay in one place. YOU see the cursor does not stop when you release pressure on the stick!! So you have to do minute motions with the stick and basically fire blindly until random chance has the reticule go over the item you want to shoot at.All of these things were bearable for the first 5 or 6 hours of the game(I explored every nook and cranny I was loving the game so much) The first few bosses were not too bad and then I got to a big bug boss who would recharge with these mirrors. Here is the method. You shoot this boss(for some reason the lock on was very shoddy for this boss) until he gets kind of winded. You then have to shoot a little red spot on the base of the mirror(Sorry for the spoilers but if you want to play this game, you are probably not going to want to read this review anyway right?) To destroy the mirror you have to hold the fire button to do a power shot at it. But the aim is so crappy that you miss half the time!! The first boss of the game was real easy and you could lock and jump sideways. Not sure why but that method did not work with this boss and he absolutely raped me time and time again.To make matters ever worse, this game uses Save spots. This would be okay if the damn save spots were right next to the boss. NOOOOO. YOu respawn way the hell away from the boss and have to do a 5 minute platforming section to get back to him. Why do Japanese games not believe the the checkpoint system? Please tell me why??????Uggh. I think I am just too used to modern games which are a lot more forgiving.

Last time I knocked him into the lava I thought he was gone for good, but I guess it was some sort of illusion or clone.  That guy just won't stay down.  Now he has crossed Metroid with a potato and ruined my day.The game is a lame FP shooter that lacks the spirit of the originals.  It was like : &#34;Here! take samus and throw her into some other game that contains space stuff.&#34;  It's ok, but no Metroid Mother Brain would be proud of.

    Nintendo",2,"Everyone was talking about this game by the time I bought it... 10 scores, 5 stars... So, of course, I bought. I'm asking: why?The story is about a mercenary - Samus Aran. I'm not very expert in Metroid stuff, but I knew the Chozo -  a race - created her to be a warrior. The Chozo were &quot;the big guys&quot;, with superior technology and stuff... Until one day, some bad guys called the Space Pirates killed most of the Chozo. Samus survived. She grew up and now she's  a great warrior. The game is in future, of course... The planet you'll be in is called Tallon IV... Well, let's go to the real review:- Graphics: OK, here I must say the game rules. The graphics are really perfect. The raindrops fall over your visor,  when it's really hot your visor changes, or when it's cold... I mean... This is one of - if not THE - the best GameCube graphics ever. One of the best game graphics EVER!- Fun: This is where the problem begins... The game is too hard. You must spend something like 40 hours to beat it without a walkthrough... And you have to walk A LOT to go from a place to another one...This makes you REALLY tired... The boss battles make your fingers hurt really bad! You'll surely be confused about controlling Samus. It's really hard too. Every time I play this game, it gives me a big headache. If you think it's fun to be with a big headache and fingers hurting, then this is your game...- Educative: I can't see anything educative here... There isn't any blood, so don't worry with that... Violence? Well, you're just shooting aliens and &quot;bad guys&quot;. You aren't killing humans or anything.After all, you just might rent it, or don't even play it...

    Nintendo",2,"The age old battle between myself and the lizard king continues!At first I thought this was going to be an awesome game because I love the old metroid games, but it was all a clever trap divised by that creepy Lizard King.  Last time I knocked him into the lava I thought he was gone for good, but I guess it was some sort of illusion or clone.  That guy just won't stay down.  Now he has crossed Metroid with a potato and ruined my day.The game is a lame FP shooter that lacks the spirit of the originals.  It was like : &#34;Here! take samus and throw her into some other game that contains space stuff.&#34;  It's ok, but no Metroid Mother Brain would be proud of.  If you don't know who Mother Brain is then you probably like this game.I am wondering now who told the Lizard King about my love for Metroid. Maybe there is a traitor in my inner circle.  GREAT! Good luck sleeping tonight!",The lizard king wins again!

    Nintendo",2,"After being told it was the best game ever, I bought this game and was very very disappointed. You walk around lost half the game, get an idea of what to do and where to go then get lost again for another 30 minutes. I am usually very good at harder more complex puzzling games, but this one just pushes the limit. 2 stars for graphics those were pretty good.",Way to difficult and confusing

    Nintendo",2,"Everyone was talking about this game by the time I bought it... 10 scores, 5 stars... So, of course, I bought. I'm asking: why?The story is about a mercenary - Samus Aran. I'm not very expert in Metroid stuff, but I knew the Chozo -  a race - created her to be a warrior. The Chozo were &quot;the big guys&quot;, with superior technology and stuff... Until one day, some bad guys called the Space Pirates killed most of the Chozo. Samus survived. She grew up and now she's  a great warrior. The game is in future, of course... The planet you'll be in is called Tallon IV... Well, let's go to the real review:- Graphics: OK, here I must say the game rules. The graphics are really perfect. The raindrops fall over your visor,  when it's really hot your visor changes, or when it's cold... I mean... This is one of - if not THE - the best GameCube graphics ever. One of the best game graphics EVER!- Fun: This is where the problem begins... The game is too hard. You must spend something like 40 hours to beat it without a walkthrough... And you have to walk A LOT to go from a place to another one...This makes you REALLY tired... The boss battles make your fingers hurt really bad! You'll surely be confused about controlling Samus. It's really hard too. Every time I play this game, it gives me a big headache. If you think it's fun to be with a big headache and fingers hurting, then this is your game...- Educative: I can't see anything educative here... There isn't any blood, so don't worry with that... Violence? Well, you're just shooting aliens and &quot;bad guys&quot;. You aren't killing humans or anything.After all, you just might rent it, or don't even play it... It'll let you really down..",One of the worst action games ever...
19074,Nintendo,1,"Nintendo has shafted me again, first with a n64 that had no third party support. Now the same thing has happened with my Gamecube. I own all three new systems plus 5 older systems and I work for software etc. I know my business and our sales speak volumes. XBOX sales have picked up while Gamecube sales have dropped. well there is always the next system. For Gamecube I had to buy memory cards, a keyboard, an ethernet adapter, Then I bought an XBOX. Unlimited memory, and the only thing you might have to purchase is a dvd playback kit(which is cheaper than a Gamecube memory card). I own a real dvd player and im not stupid enough to use my console as a primary dvd player. Gamecube doesnt even have this option. This is 2003, 99% of the world doesnt have to use their game console as a dvd player. I found that most of the games on Gamecube are on XBOX except on XBOX they contain extras, far better graphics, sound and some even add online play. While online you can chat in every game, no need for a keyboard. Gamecube only offers 1 game with online play(shame on them).XBOX has over 235 games available and over 250 for this year alone, so games is not an issue. Finally someone has built a better system then ps2 and Gamecube. ps2 is good, gamecube is better, but the loading times, muddy jaggy graphics, no dolby digital,and now its losing all its exclusives to xbox. ps2 &amp; gamecube exclusives are getting fewer and the ones they have are seeking ways to get their games on other systems. GTAVC for example, rockstar is planning on releasing a side story to gta only for XBOX, so you can expect great graphics and much better gameplay on xbox. With games like Halo 2, Tao feng, Project Gothom 2, Dino Crisis 3, UFC Tapout 2, Dead or Alice Chronos, Brute force, Rallisport 2, Mech Assault,Unreal Championship, Panzer Draggon Orta, and many more exclusives, the proof is there if you look, developers are putting their best games on XBOX and then dumping the left overs on ps2 and gamecube. The XBOX exclusive games put anything the ps2 or gamecube has done to shame. Halo was released over a year ago and there still has been nothing from ps2 or gamecube that even comes close to the graphics, sound, story and even the online play rocks even though its not offical through xbox live, you have to play through gamespy.

There could have been more powerups. Some levels seem stacked against you unless you literally play them perfectly.Another thing that annoyed is the missions that you lead the convoy. That started off fun but there should have been more flexibility. For example, if you stray to off the path, you lose, if one of your men die, you lose. Again they don't allow much leeway here and this cuts into the fun.The Storm Front level and Bullfight which started of as fun levels became annoying because of this.

For a Metroid game, it's awful.  There is no sense of isolation, a key factor of the franchise.  Samus is following non-sensical orders from a computer, with zero effort to justify them.  The entire game, the player is told to slowly traverse seven various areas of a large space station, each time allowing your enemies to further infiltrate the station.  And, why?  FOR NO REASON.  A quick boil-down of the premise:  (1)There are parasites on board; they are incredibly dangerous and cannot safely be interacted with.  (2)Go run around with them, reacting to their presence on the ship and helping them spread.  (3)Uh-oh.  Things aren't going well?  Why, how did that happen!?!?!The only reason this story gets a second star out of five is that were one to take the Metroid logo off of it, slap new names on the characters and pretend it's a new franchise, it would be slightly less intolerable.---Gameplay--- ~1/5 StarsThe worst comment for a Metroid-style game: It is unbelievably linear.  The player has zero option as to how to proceed.  Doors are locked or unlocked for you, and you cannot get around them until the very end of the game.  What's worse, you are forced to hold poorly-written, one-way conversations with the computer character between every action.  Enter a new area: Talk to the PC.  Find a power-up: Talk to the PC.  See a boss off in the distance: Talk to the PC.  I found this absolutely inexcusable.Samus is simultaneously over-powered for some enemies and wholely defenseless against others.  The vast majority of enemies, and most bosses, take two shots to kill and don't cause any damage when they hit you.  Several other bosses and a hand-full of general enemies can kill Samus with three or so hits, and require all your missiles to kill.  There seems to be no logic as to enemies' difficulties, and you will often find yourself frustrated by situations where you can only succeed if very lucky.There are so many power-ups as to make it completely unfulfilling to collect them.  Furthermore, while most are lying in plain view and the player walks into them as a matter of course, others are so meticulously hidden and require pain-staking, repeated effort to collect as to be intolerably frustrating and not worth the effort.  The casual gamer will be bored, and the completionist will be frustrated.  It's just awful.---Replay--- ~1/5 StarsIf you can actually bring yourself to pick this game up a second time, you'll find both the linear-ness and the forced conversations with the computer character even more mind-numbing.  There are few things worse than a forced cut-scene, which you cannot skip, slowly explaining something you already know.  There is simply no point in replaying this game.---Overall--- ~1/5 StarsIt's just a bad game.  And it's absolutely awful for a Metroid Game.

    Nintendo",2,"Update- July 21, 2013I'm playing this game again after many years and oh my, what a big disappointment.  It doesn't hold up at all!  A big name Zelda title is supposed to be the greatest day next to Christmas.  Wind Waker admittedly does a lot of things right but the trade off is that it does WAY more things wrong.  Where to begin with this mess...Let's begin with the dungeons.  All of them are boring and colorless in appearance, unnecessarily overlong and confusing to figure out.  It's not like in the 2D Zelda games where sword cutting action is combined with creative puzzles- THESE dungeons are 80% puzzles and 20% action.  Having to run through gigantic nearly-empty rooms with eerie music in the background doesn't qualify as epic either.  Nice try Nintendo.  The two dungeons that are most unforgivable are the water dungeon (Tower of the Gods) and the one that involves having to babysit... er, team up with a female bird lady character named Medli and help her through the dungeon (Earth Temple).  Even though Link and Medli work together, it still feels more like babysitting.  While the dungeon puzzles are honestly thought-provoking and you will feel a great sense of accomplishment upon figuring them out, these two dungeons are the reason I'm not going back to this game ever again.  Do you *really* want to persevere this kind of torture again?  These aren't the kind of puzzles you ever desire to repeat.  Not when they take forever just to get through.  Even if you were to attempt a speedrun through these dungeons, the tedious nature of grinding through puzzle after puzzle assures you won't be speedrunning at a pace you'd prefer.The water dungeon is probably the worse of the two, but then again, maybe not.  I wasn't stuck on it nearly as long as the Earth Temple but on the other hand, the obstacles I faced were probably a lot worse.  The best way to describe the dungeon is like this- the first half is occupied with flooded rooms where the water raises and lowers approximately every 10-15 seconds, and the second half is all about a series of tedious statue-pushing puzzles.  When I say the water goes up and down I mean exactly that- you have to *wait* for the water to rise or lower because Link will then be able to swim to a platform or room within reach.  This is all totally required on the part of the player if you actually want to complete the dungeon and of course, that's why you're playing the game.  You *have* to deal with the moving waters.  In one unbelievably horrific room, you have to light a torch and jump across a series of perfectly lined up crates floating on top of the water.  Oh but that's not all.  If you miss you'll jump in the water, which means your flame will go out and you'll have to re-light the torch and attempt to move across the crates once again.  And you have to line up the crates when the water temporarily recedes so there's a proper and accurate path for Link's jumping.  If not for Ocarina of Time's water dungeon, this would unquestionably be a STRONG contender for the worst dungeon ever made.The other dungeon I mention involves the female bird lady character (Medli) where you have to do a series of tedious tasks that involve lifting her up and carrying her around or she'll get stuck behind.  She's also often needed to pick up and fly around Link to high or faraway platforms/places, and the main theme seems to be taking your shield (or Medli's shield) and reflecting the light that shines through ceiling or wall cracks in order to break open more passageways, chests or secrets, giving you access to the next area.  Your shield is basically used as a weapon in these instances.  At first it seems creative but you have to do this same task over and OVER again, and since each room serves more as overlong puzzles, you'll be stuck in this castle for hours.  I guarantee it.  Wouldn't be so bad if the enemies (such as those high-pitched screaming skeletons that freeze Link in place) were more abundant instead of scarce.  The one thing that REALLY annoys me is that you have to play ""melody commands"" to activate Medli a certain way.  You have to do this so many times, not just here but throughout the game, that it totally overstays its welcome after a while.  It's out of place in a Zelda game.  Just because Link played the flute in the 2D games does NOT give Nintendo the right to stretch out this unbearable mini musical story for all its worth in the sequels.  Overdone, boring and unnecessary.  In the Wind Temple, you have to guide a little mechanical propeller-lifting chicken-like thing called Makar (at least, it *looks* like a skinned chicken don't you think?) to higher areas/platforms to activate blocks and other things.  The fun wears thin when the realization that you have to do this same task over and over creeps in.  A poor attempt at designing dungeons Nintendo.  Shame on you.You already know the next problem I'm going to mention since it's been said a thousand times by now.  The actual sailing to get from one island to another takes forever with little in the way of doing anything interesting along the way.  The sail boat moves incredibly slow, and even though sometimes you might talk to a helpful fish for advice and discover treasure chests full of rupees, trifocre charts/shards or heart container pieces along the way (and even a boring rupee-collecting mini game involving a boat race later on) none of these things make up for the tediousness of waiting... and waiting... and falling asleep!  and waiting some more, until your boat arrives to your destination.  Ugh.  You can control the boat anywhere you want but it's not like there's a whole lot to do.  I realize a lot of people dislike the bird flying in Skyward Sword because it takes a while to arrive to your desired island in that game as well, but at least it's more heroic, soaring and adventurous watching Link riding a bird and closing in on an approaching island.  Here... with a sail boat... it just doesn't deliver the same kind of excitement.  Though granted, the peaceful serenity of the nighttime sailing is pretty cool especially when you glance at the moon and stars above, and I even like when danger occasionally occurs (such as swarming sharks and cannonballs later on) because it adds a bit of suspense.  I mean you're on a mere sail boat and here comes danger!  This isn't as threatening of a situation as you might be thinking, however.Several of the errands you do in town are so bad it makes me crings just thinking about them.  Having to snap photos of a man and woman when they're together or when a man is putting mail in the town mailbox?  REALLY annoying.  Starting up a ferris wheel?  Delivering love letters to characters who don't even deserve to be loved?  Chasing school children in a hide and seek game so you can impress the school teacher who's nothing but a snotty high and mighty, unappreciative nobody?  She only cares about money and being glamorous and is someone that in reality I'd avoid like the plague!  The picture rearranging games you sometimes discover on the walls of one or two rooms are really annoying too and not worth the reward for completing them (50 rupees if I remember).  There's a few other instances of errand-related annoyances, some of which are requirements.  The one where you have to crawl through a series of crawl spaces in maze-like fashion is confusing since every room looks exactly the same but thankfully this area is short, and the other one where you have to figure out which doors with a flame above them leads to your prize at the end feels like yet another waste of time but, again, it's short.On the flipside, I can name three mini games that are awesome.  The auction bidding is the most noticeable one.  It's fairly realistic and pretty fun too, especially the tension you feel after you make a high bid and you nervously count down the seconds anticipating if anyone's going to top your bid.  The battleship mini game is really fun.  I could probably spend 30-45 minutes on this game alone.  The guy in charge of the battleship game is the worst human being I've ever seen in a Zelda game.  Completely unfunny.  And the leaf parachute game where the object is to float across the water and strategically use the tornadoes to elevate your height so you can reach the finish line is the best of the bunch.  These are really entertaining games.The boss fights are alright though most of them are quite easy to take down.  In fact other than Ganon, they're *all* easy to take down.  Maybe the strategies were fairly complex back in 2003, but these bosses are too simplistic and boring these days.  The one where you have to battle a gigantic bird on a rooftop is WAY too reminiscent of the Ridley fight from Metroid Prime.  Even his attack and flying patterns are similar.  The only difference is that you're using a sword instead of an arm cannon obviously since this is a Zelda game.  Ganon's first battle at the end of the game is basically a 3 dimensional version of the Moldorm worm from Link to the Past but a much faster and harder way of damaging.  This part of the fight offensively requires luck to defeat- just hope you'll be standing near Ganon's weak point ready to strike when he speeds by.  A final boss fight should always be strategic instead of lucky.  The cel-shading graphics were the topic of conversation back in the day but now they look sort of dark, uninteresting and overbearingly cutesy.  Link and Zelda have ugly eyes and heads, and their bodies aren't pretty either.  Some of the characters such as the pirate named Miss Tetra are really awesome, but fail in comparison to the greater variety and diversity that Link to the Past and Skyward Sword's character selection presents.  The Miss Tetra storyline takes a drastic horrible turn later on when... ugh.  I can't spoil it.  All potential pertaining to the pirate storyline falls apart once *this* happens.The enemy combat usually consists of being able to walk up to most armored guards/blob creatures (and a few others) and slash them to death with your sword.  Some of them require the leaf, bow and arrow or bombs to destroy however.  Even though dealing with them is really easy, we can't overlook that it's also *really* darn fun.  Usually the guards (Darknuts) don't pose much of a threat, but sometimes you will have to prepare to move Link out of the way of a lunging sword attack.  This is usually in the later half of the game.  It gets especially dangerous when there's 3 or more Darknuts on screen.  You may have to execute some stellar sword trickery to escape.  I LOVE that one super spin attack that enables Link to spin around with his sword like a hurricane for 10 seconds and basically eliminate a room full of problems, or at the very least severely damage everything in sight.  It's awesome.  Like I say above, the melody (button) commands are awful due to this being a requirement WAY too often.  You HAVE to do this in order to change the direction of the wind so your sail boat can reach the island of your choice.  Having to frequently command a melody to steer your sail boat to another direction/location gets boring after a while, and as I say above, doing it in the castles gets especially tiresome and reduntant.I like some of the items and weapons Link uses.  The rope is a nifty way of swinging across branches to reach high or faraway areas, and the leaf parachute offers a similar function.  I LOVE the impactful beauty and effects of launching ice and fire arrows at a target as well.  The bow and arrow is a dangerous weapon as you'd expect since it's Zelda where the bow and arrow has always been crucial for survival.  This weapon is especially helpful and frequent in Wind Waker it seems.  These items and weapons really bring out the adventurous surroundings.  The game is overall very generous with the rupees as well.  You'll be collecting them by the bucket load.  They have yellow and purple rupees which adds up your amount rather fast.  Silver rupees hidden in chests under the water can reward you with 200 rupees, and orange rupees give 100.  Red rupees are back (worth 20).  Blue and green ones too.  Insanely generous.  Unless you haven't been collecting them, you'll probably have close to 5,000 by the final dungeon.  The swinging of the sword flows remarkably well.  There's no confusion in how you want to attack an enemy either.  Your sword won't ever let you down in the heat of a battle, nor will Link's movements.  The game encourages you to walk right up to enemies and slice 'em up.  If you don't, well, they seem to back off and wander around the room for a while giving you plenty of time to make preparations for another attack.  Simply put, enemies usually aren't as relentless as YOU are which may be a good thing since it means the game is hardly ever overly difficult.What I HATE however is the overlong fetch quest concerning the triforce shards and the charts.  You have to find BOTH the charts and the shards in the open water which can take several hours of searching.  You'll be sailing around for a while, but an even bigger problem is that it's unnecessary to even *have* such a quest after all the hours of boat sailing that has already taken place by this point.  This entire quest is overkill and I despise it.  I'm not too crazy about having to re-fight the bosses again at the end of the game either.  This time the colors on screen change to black and white perhaps a way to make the adventure feel more intense, and when you land the final blow you're simply transported back to the dungeon to take on the next boss.  It's... strange to say the least.  There's no feeling of satisfaction when you defeat them once again.  Then again, like I say above, there's no feeling of satisfaction anyway due to the bosses being easy overall.  Though I suppose it works in a ""reminiscing over previous encounters"" kind of way which illustrates how far Link has come since his sister went missing/introduction of Miss Tetra near the beginning.Wind Waker encourages more exploring than sword combat, so be prepared to spend more time exploring for items and treasures and less time fighting.  This means exploring many and I mean MANY empty islands with nothing but grass, high cliffs and trees everywhere.  Many of these islands contain caves or holes where items and chests are hidden, some of which provide decent atmosphere I admit.  After all falling in a big hole and landing near streams and being surrounded by high mountains is a unique feeling of adventure.  However there are two particularly offensive rooms near the end of the game where you keep falling through hole after hole (about 30 of them total) fighting 90% of the enemy varities you've already encountered which may be cool and serves as a nice combat-oriented mission, but feels like a clumsy way of making up for the lack of combat you experienced up to this point.  Like Nintendo just tacked this section on to make up for the distinct lack of combat throughout the game.  I'd bet anything that these two parts of the game contain more than 50% of the enemies in the game overall.  Why not spread these enemies around the dungeons and the islands?The music however, is INCREDIBLE!  Perhaps the best soundtrack ever in a Zelda game.  The soothingly beautiful credits theme is amazing beyond description, but my favorite is the fast-paced Jethro Tull or Renaissance like theme music that plays whenever you arrive to a mini boss.  It's diverse enough to be classified as a progressive rock song, seriously.  Just LISTEN to how awesome it is!  Other songs are really melodic and fit in appropriately and excitedly with the heroic theme of the fairy tale locations the Zelda series is known for.  Oh and perhaps my favorite part of the game- the dramatic and uneasy music you hear whenever you encounter an enemy.  It's suspenseful and makes you feel paranoid, threatened and overwhelmed by the upcoming danger.  It's *awesome*.  There's even some perfectly utilized sound effects while this particular theme is playing giving off a feeling of mystery and uncertainty.  I don't particularly care for the annoying sounds Link makes though.  He should have remained silent.  At least we can breathe easy knowing the one ice section later on is short because Link sliding around sounds like a baby animal being massacred by a group of wild barbarians.  Oh and speaking of which, these ice and fire dungeons shouldn't technically be considered dungeons since they're only one or two rooms long.  It literally only takes 2 minutes to complete them.Overall, go with Skyward Sword for a better 3D representation instead.  That game better represents the Zelda formula on all counts especially graphics, storytelling and overall epicness (but not music though- Wind Waker takes the crown there).  Wind Waker just doesn't provide much in the way of substance or pacing.  The triforce chart/shard quest is a big, extremely overlong letdown almost making you not want to finish the game.  How many times have I wanted to give up on a Zelda game due to boredom?  Never before.  The islands should have been closer together too.  This would have helped trim down on the unnecessary length of the game.",really misses the mark in several areas

    Nintendo",1,"When Ocarina of Time for N64 came out, people were blown away.So naturally, when gamecube was released, people expected another great Zelda with realistic 3D graphics, and to everyone's shock (and to some's horror) Nintendo's next big Zelda was announced to use cell-shading technique, which provides cartoonish graphics for video games.I too was surprised to find this change, but nonetheless bought a copy at full price because, hey, it's Zelda. Soon my doubts cleared and I had a blast playing this masterpiece.To people that played Ocarina, this game will bring back the memories as it features many of the same sounds, music, and controls that were used in the N64 version. And although the cell-shaded graphics wasn't what people expected, it fits perfectly well into the atmosphere of the game, and once you get used to it you'll love it so much.When Wind Waker first came out, there were some critics that called this game childish and said it was a bad installment for the whole franchise. But time proved them wrong. The only childish thing about this game, if at all, is the difficulty which has been tuned down a lot compared to the N64 Zelda. Wind Waker is such a good game that it has even become my new favorite Zelda of all time, and that's saying a lot since most of the Zelda games are of grade A++.However, everything will soon change, at least I hope. The now-being-developed game of Twilight Princess has apparently made quite an impact on people that played it in E3, and now even the Cell-Shading hater can't say nothing to Zelda because it is gonna be as real as anything, like the code name for the project indicates, REAL ZELDA. Yes Link's body is gonna be proportional again in the next installment, yay?!Nintendo is really taking their time on Twilight Princess(years!! It was supposed to come out in 2005 but they decided to postpone it to make it even greater????) so it will undoubtfully be another masterpiece. If it's as good as Wind Waker you know I'll buy it.

Then he looses it later in the game and has to run around cluelessly trying to find it again.  Talk about barely any action. After that he gets a talking boat and a goofy wand that, apparently, lets him controll the wind. What's with that? I don't call this a &quot;puzzle&quot; game. I call it a BORING game.

    Nintendo",1,"What happened to Zelda?  Where did it go?  What am I babbling about?  Well, I'd love to explain to you all the problems I had with this game, but unfortunately, I can only use a certain number of words for this review, so I'll cover all the main problems I had with it.First and most important is the ending.  The ending was depressing for anyone who's ever played a Zelda title.  Changing the ending alone would have been enough to make the game about 5 times better.  I won't tell you what it was, only that it was TERRIBLE.Secondly, the Gameplay barely existed.  I found that half the game was spent doing NOTHING.  I just set up my sail and waited for five minutes while the game propelled me to my next destination.  The other half of the game was spent fighting battles and solving puzzles that were so easy, no five-year-old would fail at them.Storyline-wise, this game is a flop.  It contains only one realistically-behaving character; Ganon.  The rest of the characters are the product of plot holes, and are moved along BY the story, not the other way around.  Big problem in any game these days.The graphics annoyed me, but only because the character models were very ugly.  And as for the music, it just seemed incongrous very often.Plus, none of the characters talk!  On the GCN!  That's laziness to the umteenth power from a game-design perspective.Still, although I thought this game was a piece of garbage, there are those who found it fun, so I would be being unfair to say it is IMPOSSIBLE to like this game, despite all the huge, gaping flaws and mindless tedium it showcases.  To make everyone happy, I reccomend that you rent this game once to see whether or not you'll like it.  Don't make the mistake of buying it right off the bat like I did.",What happened to Zelda?!

Yes Ocarina of time was OK, but not good enough to save this series. Wind Waker completly destroyed it. Link looks and talks like a complete loser. But you may say graphics arent everything.

    Nintendo",2,"Reading some of the reviews posted before, I got the feeling a number of these reviewers didn't actually finish the game. I agree with them completely about the first half of it, it's fun, it's pretty. The graphics, control system, and gameplay are all very good. And for the beginning, the story is excellent.Where I disagree is in the rest of it. The second half of the game involves amazing amounts of guesswork, and very little encouragement, making the game lose most all of it's wonderful momentum. I started out overjoyed and having fun, then it all drained away.Every time I started really enjoying myself - in a fight, a jumping puzzle, a dungeon crawl, I ran into something that just got in the way of it. Most often, it would be something that was tricky to figure out, and then you get that proud feeling when you do, but then doing what you figured out proved tedious and aggravating. I was ok with the sailing, I liked the graphics, I liked the story, and I liked the controls; but this game was designed in large part by a sadist. I've heard reviewers say it was easy, a lot of it is, but the parts that aren't are not difficult because the puzzles are complicated, they're just designed to be just hard enough that knowing what you have to do was less than half the battle.I've played every Zelda game made, they've all had nasty tricky puzzles, but this is the first one where the puzzles are harder to complete than to figure out. Last time I checked, the point of a puzzle was solving it, not writing down the solution.The story is all right, most notably because it is different from every other Zelda game made before. The unique flavor adds a lot to it, but the story remains pretty sparse considering the amount of leg-work between plot moments.I have to say, having played through the entire game and gotten through every side quest, that it's good aspects are seriously hurt by it's overly irritating nature.(Plus, one of the characters you have to rely on very heavily not only empties your purse, but is just damned obnoxious, good old pal Tingle!)","Every time I started to have fun, the game got in the way"

    Nintendo",2,"Pathetic and unworthy of the name ""Legend of Zelda.""When I saw screenshots for this game prior to its release I was up in arms, as were many people, and ready to avoid this game like the plague. Unfortunately, many people seem (for some unknown reason) to have been won over by the game after its release; I, however, found the disappointment of playing this game to be exactly commensurate with my expectations.I decided to give the game an honest chance; I thought, ""Just look at it as Ocarina of Time with different graphics and different levels."" Sadly, the only thing carried over from OoT were the horrible controls (funny how technology advances and Nintendo still can't manage to achieve correspondence between controller inputs and character actions; oh well...), though one could stretch a point and say that OoT did introduce gratuitously bizarre new elements to the Zelda world (the Goron race comes to mind), but TWW takes this to such an extreme that I cannot forgive it for its eccentricities as I did OoT.TWW is boring and embarrassing. Boring because the story has virtually no connection to the prior Zelda games, so the hardcore fan really has to make a mental leap to even consider this as continuous with the other games. Boring also because the game starts out with sheer tedium; it took what seemed like forever to get the sword, only to lose it in the first level. And the game actually starts out with a Gerudo Fortress-like level where one must evade detection. One would think that Shiggy would start the game out with the most fun and pleasant puzzles he possibly could, to encourage immersion in the game before challenging the gamer's patience, but the worst trials of my patience came right at the beginning of the game.The game is embarrassing because it is extremely immature in a way reminiscient of Majora's Mask. I'm not sure if it's just the way the Japanese design games, but the bizarre childish characters and graphics were very off-putting. While I'm on the subject, the graphics are terrible. There is no sense that this is a Zelda game; it's a cartoon. There is certainly no sense of darkness in the game either, something every Zelda game before this has had. The game is very lighthearted and giddy and yet tedious. Excellent combination for boring me to death.I kept playing, hoping for a break to the boredom, but it never came. I stopped playing this game and have no intention of coming back to it. Adventure of Link was good enough as a game that I finished it, but this game is just terrible.

    Nintendo",2,"Think back the fall of 1999 when ""The Blair Witch Project"" was released.  The elitist movie critics were in a full-fledged campaign to convince the public and themselves that the movie was the best thing since ""Citizen Kane"".  Back in 1999 so much praise was showered on the film that the voices of dissent were drowned out and ridiculed.  Then a funny thing happened: time passed.  Like the rest of the superficial Hollywood crowd, the elitist critics have moved on and this has allowed people to freely rethink the movie.  Now it's hard to find anyone who's filling to admit they liked the ""Blair Witch Project"".  Why do I mention that?  Because the story's nearly the same when it comes to the near universal praise of Nintendo's ""Wind Waker"" game.Since ""Wind Waker"" is a Zelda game, and since the Zelda franchise is amazing, the ""Wind Waker"" must be amazing too, right?  Right? Unfortunately, no, but equally disturbing is how the gaming community answered ""yes"" to that question.  They went into a full-fledged campaign to convince themselves, and the public, that this game deserved a pedestal next to ""Link to the Past"" and ""Ocarina of Time"".  Only now, years after its release, do I hear consistent complaints about the game.  Below is a list of problems with the game:1) The sailing aspect of the game takes up at least 50% of the adventure and it is extremely tedious.  Nintendo didn't even attempt to streamline this process.  You can literally set your direction, put the controller on the floor, and sit back and watch the minutes pass as Link sails along to your destination.  In order to further extend the playtime of sailing, the user is forced to embark on numerous mini-quests where many must be performed numerous times through the game.  The most annoying are the ""fetch quests"" where you dredge the ocean floor for items.  *Yawn* Are we having fun yet?2) The game consists of only a few dungeons, and some of them are extremely easy.  Important aspects of the game were replaced with time-consuming fetch quests from the ship.3) The game has an unexploited storyline.  I can think of numerous examples of storyline elements that seem like they should conclude in something big, but completely fizzle out.  (Between this and the lack of dungeons, I am convinced this game was rushed to market)4) I might as well say it: the graphics are terrible but otherwise fit the overall-quality of the game.  The Link model is the worst: a massive head, massive eyes, and eyebrows that somehow float over his hair.  At least you spend most of your time staring at the back of Link's head.5) Before release we were told that the NPC (non playable characters) were going to be far more advanced than others we've seen in the past.  I have no idea where Nintendo got off promoting that idea because they are identical in sophistication to those in OoT and just about every video game I've played.  They certainly aren't as interesting as those from Majora's Mask.6) And I've just grown tired of games where you must constantly switch between the game and an item selection submenu.  Metroid didn't need this and neither did Star Fox Adventures.  I'd love to see Nintendo incorporate something that would minimize this behavior in their Zelda games.  The problem is especially bad in The Wind Waker because an entire item slot is wasted on the sail.7) Fighting non-boss enemies is extremely easy.  Just Z-target and swing your sword for a few moments and the green A button icon will change to a green star and flash.  Press the button when this happens and Link does an incredible feat of acrobatics and destroys his foe.  It looks awesome, but you quickly learn that this ability makes it extremely easy to fight nearly anything.  It also makes the game feel like its playing on autopilot and you are just a bystander watching.So this is a review for those interested in Twilight Princess.  Whether your itching for a Zelda fix while waiting for TP or have played and enjoyed TP and want more Zelda, I've just gotta warn you that Wind Waker is not worth the trouble.",Tedious and overrated

    Nintendo",2,This is the worst zelda game of all time for all nintendo systems.  It just doesn't have the charm of the other zelda games.  It gets really old and tedious spending all that time sailing across an ocean. Somehow sailing across an ocean and Link just don't match up. It doesn't stand the test of time like the other zelda's.  I played through all zelda games all the way through.  Here's my favorite zelda games in order.........1.  Link To The Past - snes2.  Ocarina of Time - N643.  Legend of Zelda - nintendo4.  Majora's Mask - N645.  Legend of Zelda 2 - nintendo6.  Windwaker - gamecubeSorry folks nintendo got it wrong with windwaker.  Hopefully they'll redeem the magic of zelda with twilight princess.,worst zelda game of all time

    Nintendo",2,"Update- July 21, 2013I'm playing this game again after many years and oh my, what a big disappointment.  It doesn't hold up at all!  A big name Zelda title is supposed to be the greatest day next to Christmas.  Wind Waker admittedly does a lot of things right but the trade off is that it does WAY more things wrong.  Where to begin with this mess...Let's begin with the dungeons.  All of them are boring and colorless in appearance, unnecessarily overlong and confusing to figure out.  It's not like in the 2D Zelda games where sword cutting action is combined with creative puzzles- THESE dungeons are 80% puzzles and 20% action.  Having to run through gigantic nearly-empty rooms with eerie music in the background doesn't qualify as epic either.  Nice try Nintendo.  The two dungeons that are most unforgivable are the water dungeon (Tower of the Gods) and the one that involves having to babysit... er, team up with a female bird lady character named Medli and help her through the dungeon (Earth Temple).  Even though Link and Medli work together, it still feels more like babysitting.  While the dungeon puzzles are honestly thought-provoking and you will feel a great sense of accomplishment upon figuring them out, these two dungeons are the reason I'm not going back to this game ever again.  Do you *really* want to persevere this kind of torture again?  These aren't the kind of puzzles you ever desire to repeat.  Not when they take forever just to get through.  Even if you were to attempt a speedrun through these dungeons, the tedious nature of grinding through puzzle after puzzle assures you won't be speedrunning at a pace you'd prefer.The water dungeon is probably the worse of the two, but then again, maybe not.  I wasn't stuck on it nearly as long as the Earth Temple but on the other hand, the obstacles I faced were probably a lot worse.  The best way to describe the dungeon is like this- the first half is occupied with flooded rooms where the water raises and lowers approximately every 10-15 seconds, and the second half is all about a series of tedious statue-pushing puzzles.  When I say the water goes up and down I mean exactly that- you have to *wait* for the water to rise or lower because Link will then be able to swim to a platform or room within reach.  This is all totally required on the part of the player if you actually want to complete the dungeon and of course, that's why you're playing the game.  You *have* to deal with the moving waters.  In one unbelievably horrific room, you have to light a torch and jump across a series of perfectly lined up crates floating on top of the water.  Oh but that's not all.  If you miss you'll jump in the water, which means your flame will go out and you'll have to re-light the torch and attempt to move across the crates once again.  And you have to line up the crates when the water temporarily recedes so there's a proper and accurate path for Link's jumping.  If not for Ocarina of Time's water dungeon, this would unquestionably be a STRONG contender for the worst dungeon ever made.The other dungeon I mention involves the female bird lady character (Medli) where you have to do a series of tedious tasks that involve lifting her up and carrying her around or she'll get stuck behind.  She's also often needed to pick up and fly around Link to high or faraway platforms/places, and the main theme seems to be taking your shield (or Medli's shield) and reflecting the light that shines through ceiling or wall cracks in order to break open more passageways, chests or secrets, giving you access to the next area.  Your shield is basically used as a weapon in these instances.  At first it seems creative but you have to do this same task over and OVER again, and since each room serves more as overlong puzzles, you'll be stuck in this castle for hours.  I guarantee it.  Wouldn't be so bad if the enemies (such as those high-pitched screaming skeletons that freeze Link in place) were more abundant instead of scarce.  The one thing that REALLY annoys me is that you have to play ""melody commands"" to activate Medli a certain way.  You have to do this so many times, not just here but throughout the game, that it totally overstays its welcome after a while.  It's out of place in a Zelda game.  Just because Link played the flute in the 2D games does NOT give Nintendo the right to stretch out this unbearable mini musical story for all its worth in the sequels.  Overdone, boring and unnecessary.  In the Wind Temple, you have to guide a little mechanical propeller-lifting chicken-like thing called Makar (at least, it *looks* like a skinned chicken don't you think?) to higher areas/platforms to activate blocks and other things.  The fun wears thin when the realization that you have to do this same task over and over creeps in.  A poor attempt at designing dungeons Nintendo.  Shame on you.You already know the next problem I'm going to mention since it's been said a thousand times by now.  The actual sailing to get from one island to another takes forever with little in the way of doing anything interesting along the way.  The sail boat moves incredibly slow, and even though sometimes you might talk to a helpful fish for advice and discover treasure chests full of rupees, trifocre charts/shards or heart container pieces along the way (and even a boring rupee-collecting mini game involving a boat race later on) none of these things make up for the tediousness of waiting... and waiting... and falling asleep!  and waiting some more, until your boat arrives to your destination.  Ugh.  You can control the boat anywhere you want but it's not like there's a whole lot to do.  I realize a lot of people dislike the bird flying in Skyward Sword because it takes a while to arrive to your desired island in that game as well, but at least it's more heroic, soaring and adventurous watching Link riding a bird and closing in on an approaching island.  Here... with a sail boat... it just doesn't deliver the same kind of excitement.  Though granted, the peaceful serenity of the nighttime sailing is pretty cool especially when you glance at the moon and stars above, and I even like when danger occasionally occurs (such as swarming sharks and cannonballs later on) because it adds a bit of suspense.  I mean you're on a mere sail boat and here comes danger!  This isn't as threatening of a situation as you might be thinking, however.Several of the errands you do in town are so bad it makes me crings just thinking about them.  Having to snap photos of a man and woman when they're together or when a man is putting mail in the town mailbox?  REALLY annoying.  Starting up a ferris wheel?  Delivering love letters to characters who don't even deserve to be loved?  Chasing school children in a hide and seek game so you can impress the school teacher who's nothing but a snotty high and mighty, unappreciative nobody?  She only cares about money and being glamorous and is someone that in reality I'd avoid like the plague!  The picture rearranging games you sometimes discover on the walls of one or two rooms are really annoying too and not worth the reward for completing them (50 rupees if I remember).  There's a few other instances of errand-related annoyances, some of which are requirements.  The one where you have to crawl through a series of crawl spaces in maze-like fashion is confusing since every room looks exactly the same but thankfully this area is short, and the other one where you have to figure out which doors with a flame above them leads to your prize at the end feels like yet another waste of time but, again, it's short.On the flipside, I can name three mini games that are awesome.  The auction bidding is the most noticeable one.  It's fairly realistic and pretty fun too, especially the tension you feel after you make a high bid and you nervously count down the seconds anticipating if anyone's going to top your bid.  The battleship mini game is really fun.  I could probably spend 30-45 minutes on this game alone.  The guy in charge of the battleship game is the worst human being I've ever seen in a Zelda game.  Completely unfunny.  And the leaf parachute game where the object is to float across the water and strategically use the tornadoes to elevate your height so you can reach the finish line is the best of the bunch.  These are really entertaining games.The boss fights are alright though most of them are quite easy to take down.  In fact other than Ganon, they're *all* easy to take down.  Maybe the strategies were fairly complex back in 2003, but these bosses are too simplistic and boring these days.  The one where you have to battle a gigantic bird on a rooftop is WAY too reminiscent of the Ridley fight from Metroid Prime.  Even his attack and flying patterns are similar.  The only difference is that you're using a sword instead of an arm cannon obviously since this is a Zelda game.  Ganon's first battle at the end of the game is basically a 3 dimensional version of the Moldorm worm from Link to the Past but a much faster and harder way of damaging.  This part of the fight offensively requires luck to defeat- just hope you'll be standing near Ganon's weak point ready to strike when he speeds by.  A final boss fight should always be strategic instead of lucky.  The cel-shading graphics were the topic of conversation back in the day but now they look sort of dark, uninteresting and overbearingly cutesy.  Link and Zelda have ugly eyes and heads, and their bodies aren't pretty either.  Some of the characters such as the pirate named Miss Tetra are really awesome, but fail in comparison to the greater variety and diversity that Link to the Past and Skyward Sword's character selection presents.  The Miss Tetra storyline takes a drastic horrible turn later on when... ugh.  I can't spoil it.  All potential pertaining to the pirate storyline falls apart once *this* happens.The enemy combat usually consists of being able to walk up to most armored guards/blob creatures (and a few others) and slash them to death with your sword.  Some of them require the leaf, bow and arrow or bombs to destroy however.  Even though dealing with them is really easy, we can't overlook that it's also *really* darn fun.  Usually the guards (Darknuts) don't pose much of a threat, but sometimes you will have to prepare to move Link out of the way of a lunging sword attack.  This is usually in the later half of the game.  It gets especially dangerous when there's 3 or more Darknuts on screen.  You may have to execute some stellar sword trickery to escape.  I LOVE that one super spin attack that enables Link to spin around with his sword like a hurricane for 10 seconds and basically eliminate a room full of problems, or at the very least severely damage everything in sight.  It's awesome.  Like I say above, the melody (button) commands are awful due to this being a requirement WAY too often.  You HAVE to do this in order to change the direction of the wind so your sail boat can reach the island of your choice.  Having to frequently command a melody to steer your sail boat to another direction/location gets boring after a while, and as I say above, doing it in the castles gets especially tiresome and reduntant.I like some of the items and weapons Link uses.  The rope is a nifty way of swinging across branches to reach high or faraway areas, and the leaf parachute offers a similar function.  I LOVE the impactful beauty and effects of launching ice and fire arrows at a target as well.  The bow and arrow is a dangerous weapon as you'd expect since it's Zelda where the bow and arrow has always been crucial for survival.  This weapon is especially helpful and frequent in Wind Waker it seems.  These items and weapons really bring out the adventurous surroundings.  The game is overall very generous with the rupees as well.  You'll be collecting them by the bucket load.  They have yellow and purple rupees which adds up your amount rather fast.  Silver rupees hidden in chests under the water can reward you with 200 rupees, and orange rupees give 100.  Red rupees are back (worth 20).  Blue and green ones too.  Insanely generous.  Unless you haven't been collecting them, you'll probably have close to 5,000 by the final dungeon.  The swinging of the sword flows remarkably well.  There's no confusion in how you want to attack an enemy either.  Your sword won't ever let you down in the heat of a battle, nor will Link's movements.  The game encourages you to walk right up to enemies and slice 'em up.  If you don't, well, they seem to back off and wander around the room for a while giving you plenty of time to make preparations for another attack.  Simply put, enemies usually aren't as relentless as YOU are which may be a good thing since it means the game is hardly ever overly difficult.What I HATE however is the overlong fetch quest concerning the triforce shards and the charts.  You have to find BOTH the charts and the shards in the open water which can take several hours of searching.  You'll be sailing around for a while, but an even bigger problem is that it's unnecessary to even *have* such a quest after all the hours of boat sailing that has already taken place by this point.  This entire quest is overkill and I despise it.  I'm not too crazy about having to re-fight the bosses again at the end of the game either.  This time the colors on screen change to black and white perhaps a way to make the adventure feel more intense, and when you land the final blow you're simply transported back to the dungeon to take on the next boss.  It's... strange to say the least.  There's no feeling of satisfaction when you defeat them once again.  Then again, like I say above, there's no feeling of satisfaction anyway due to the bosses being easy overall.  Though I suppose it works in a ""reminiscing over previous encounters"" kind of way which illustrates how far Link has come since his sister went missing/introduction of Miss Tetra near the beginning.Wind Waker encourages more exploring than sword combat, so be prepared to spend more time exploring for items and treasures and less time fighting.  This means exploring many and I mean MANY empty islands with nothing but grass, high cliffs and trees everywhere.  Many of these islands contain caves or holes where items and chests are hidden, some of which provide decent atmosphere I admit.  After all falling in a big hole and landing near streams and being surrounded by high mountains is a unique feeling of adventure.  However there are two particularly offensive rooms near the end of the game where you keep falling through hole after hole (about 30 of them total) fighting 90% of the enemy varities you've already encountered which may be cool and serves as a nice combat-oriented mission, but feels like a clumsy way of making up for the lack of combat you experienced up to this point.  Like Nintendo just tacked this section on to make up for the distinct lack of combat throughout the game.  I'd bet anything that these two parts of the game contain more than 50% of the enemies in the game overall.  Why not spread these enemies around the dungeons and the islands?The music however, is INCREDIBLE!  Perhaps the best soundtrack ever in a Zelda game.  The soothingly beautiful credits theme is amazing beyond description, but my favorite is the fast-paced Jethro Tull or Renaissance like theme music that plays whenever you arrive to a mini boss.  It's diverse enough to be classified as a progressive rock song, seriously.  Just LISTEN to how awesome it is!  Other songs are really melodic and fit in appropriately and excitedly with the heroic theme of the fairy tale locations the Zelda series is known for.  Oh and perhaps my favorite part of the game- the dramatic and uneasy music you hear whenever you encounter an enemy.  It's suspenseful and makes you feel paranoid, threatened and overwhelmed by the upcoming danger.  It's *awesome*.  There's even some perfectly utilized sound effects while this particular theme is playing giving off a feeling of mystery and uncertainty.  I don't particularly care for the annoying sounds Link makes though.  He should have remained silent.  At least we can breathe easy knowing the one ice section later on is short because Link sliding around sounds like a baby animal being massacred by a group of wild barbarians.  Oh and speaking of which, these ice and fire dungeons shouldn't technically be considered dungeons since they're only one or two rooms long.  It literally only takes 2 minutes to complete them.Overall, go with Skyward Sword for a better 3D representation instead.  That game better represents the Zelda formula on all counts especially graphics, storytelling and overall epicness (but not music though- Wind Waker takes the crown there).  Wind Waker just doesn't provide much in the way of substance or pacing.  The triforce chart/shard quest is a big, extremely overlong letdown almost making you not want to finish the game.  How many times have I wanted to give up on a Zelda game due to boredom?  Never before.  The islands should have been closer together too.  This would have helped trim down on the unnecessary length of the game.",really misses the mark in several areas

    Nintendo",1,"When Ocarina of Time for N64 came out, people were blown away.So naturally, when gamecube was released, people expected another great Zelda with realistic 3D graphics, and to everyone's shock (and to some's horror) Nintendo's next big Zelda was announced to use cell-shading technique, which provides cartoonish graphics for video games.I too was surprised to find this change, but nonetheless bought a copy at full price because, hey, it's Zelda. Soon my doubts cleared and I had a blast playing this masterpiece.To people that played Ocarina, this game will bring back the memories as it features many of the same sounds, music, and controls that were used in the N64 version. And although the cell-shaded graphics wasn't what people expected, it fits perfectly well into the atmosphere of the game, and once you get used to it you'll love it so much.When Wind Waker first came out, there were some critics that called this game childish and said it was a bad installment for the whole franchise. But time proved them wrong. The only childish thing about this game, if at all, is the difficulty which has been tuned down a lot compared to the N64 Zelda. Wind Waker is such a good game that it has even become my new favorite Zelda of all time, and that's saying a lot since most of the Zelda games are of grade A++.However, everything will soon change, at least I hope. The now-being-developed game of Twilight Princess has apparently made quite an impact on people that played it in E3, and now even the Cell-Shading hater can't say nothing to Zelda because it is gonna be as real as anything, like the code name for the project indicates, REAL ZELDA. Yes Link's body is gonna be proportional again in the next installment, yay?!Nintendo is really taking their time on Twilight Princess(years!! It was supposed to come out in 2005 but they decided to postpone it to make it even greater????) so it will undoubtfully be another masterpiece. If it's as good as Wind Waker you know I'll buy it.

Then he looses it later in the game and has to run around cluelessly trying to find it again.  Talk about barely any action. After that he gets a talking boat and a goofy wand that, apparently, lets him controll the wind. What's with that? I don't call this a &quot;puzzle&quot; game. I call it a BORING game.

    Nintendo",1,"What happened to Zelda?  Where did it go?  What am I babbling about?  Well, I'd love to explain to you all the problems I had with this game, but unfortunately, I can only use a certain number of words for this review, so I'll cover all the main problems I had with it.First and most important is the ending.  The ending was depressing for anyone who's ever played a Zelda title.  Changing the ending alone would have been enough to make the game about 5 times better.  I won't tell you what it was, only that it was TERRIBLE.Secondly, the Gameplay barely existed.  I found that half the game was spent doing NOTHING.  I just set up my sail and waited for five minutes while the game propelled me to my next destination.  The other half of the game was spent fighting battles and solving puzzles that were so easy, no five-year-old would fail at them.Storyline-wise, this game is a flop.  It contains only one realistically-behaving character; Ganon.  The rest of the characters are the product of plot holes, and are moved along BY the story, not the other way around.  Big problem in any game these days.The graphics annoyed me, but only because the character models were very ugly.  And as for the music, it just seemed incongrous very often.Plus, none of the characters talk!  On the GCN!  That's laziness to the umteenth power from a game-design perspective.Still, although I thought this game was a piece of garbage, there are those who found it fun, so I would be being unfair to say it is IMPOSSIBLE to like this game, despite all the huge, gaping flaws and mindless tedium it showcases.  To make everyone happy, I reccomend that you rent this game once to see whether or not you'll like it.  Don't make the mistake of buying it right off the bat like I did. the graphics suck, boring game",What happened to Zelda?!

    Nintendo",2,"Reading some of the reviews posted before, I got the feeling a number of these reviewers didn't actually finish the game. I agree with them completely about the first half of it, it's fun, it's pretty. The graphics, control system, and gameplay are all very good. And for the beginning, the story is excellent.Where I disagree is in the rest of it. The second half of the game involves amazing amounts of guesswork, and very little encouragement, making the game lose most all of it's wonderful momentum. I started out overjoyed and having fun, then it all drained away.Every time I started really enjoying myself - in a fight, a jumping puzzle, a dungeon crawl, I ran into something that just got in the way of it. Most often, it would be something that was tricky to figure out, and then you get that proud feeling when you do, but then doing what you figured out proved tedious and aggravating. I was ok with the sailing, I liked the graphics, I liked the story, and I liked the controls; but this game was designed in large part by a sadist. I've heard reviewers say it was easy, a lot of it is, but the parts that aren't are not difficult because the puzzles are complicated, they're just designed to be just hard enough that knowing what you have to do was less than half the battle.I've played every Zelda game made, they've all had nasty tricky puzzles, but this is the first one where the puzzles are harder to complete than to figure out. Last time I checked, the point of a puzzle was solving it, not writing down the solution.The story is all right, most notably because it is different from every other Zelda game made before. The unique flavor adds a lot to it, but the story remains pretty sparse considering the amount of leg-work between plot moments.I have to say, having played through the entire game and gotten through every side quest, that it's good aspects are seriously hurt by it's overly irritating nature.(Plus, one of the characters you have to rely on very heavily not only empties your purse, but is just damned obnoxious, good old pal Tingle!)","Every time I started to have fun, the game got in the way"

    Nintendo",2,"Pathetic and unworthy of the name ""Legend of Zelda.""When I saw screenshots for this game prior to its release I was up in arms, as were many people, and ready to avoid this game like the plague. Unfortunately, many people seem (for some unknown reason) to have been won over by the game after its release; I, however, found the disappointment of playing this game to be exactly commensurate with my expectations.I decided to give the game an honest chance; I thought, ""Just look at it as Ocarina of Time with different graphics and different levels."" Sadly, the only thing carried over from OoT were the horrible controls (funny how technology advances and Nintendo still can't manage to achieve correspondence between controller inputs and character actions; oh well...), though one could stretch a point and say that OoT did introduce gratuitously bizarre new elements to the Zelda world (the Goron race comes to mind), but TWW takes this to such an extreme that I cannot forgive it for its eccentricities as I did OoT.TWW is boring and embarrassing. Boring because the story has virtually no connection to the prior Zelda games, so the hardcore fan really has to make a mental leap to even consider this as continuous with the other games. Boring also because the game starts out with sheer tedium; it took what seemed like forever to get the sword, only to lose it in the first level. And the game actually starts out with a Gerudo Fortress-like level where one must evade detection. One would think that Shiggy would start the game out with the most fun and pleasant puzzles he possibly could, to encourage immersion in the game before challenging the gamer's patience, but the worst trials of my patience came right at the beginning of the game.The game is embarrassing because it is extremely immature in a way reminiscient of Majora's Mask. I'm not sure if it's just the way the Japanese design games, but the bizarre childish characters and graphics were very off-putting. While I'm on the subject, the graphics are terrible. There is no sense that this is a Zelda game; it's a cartoon. There is certainly no sense of darkness in the game either, something every Zelda game before this has had. The game is very lighthearted and giddy and yet tedious. Excellent combination for boring me to death.I kept playing, hoping for a break to the boredom, but it never came. I stopped playing this game and have no intention of coming back to it. Adventure of Link was good enough as a game that I finished it, but this game is just terrible.

    Nintendo",2,"Think back the fall of 1999 when ""The Blair Witch Project"" was released.  The elitist movie critics were in a full-fledged campaign to convince the public and themselves that the movie was the best thing since ""Citizen Kane"".  Back in 1999 so much praise was showered on the film that the voices of dissent were drowned out and ridiculed.  Then a funny thing happened: time passed.  Like the rest of the superficial Hollywood crowd, the elitist critics have moved on and this has allowed people to freely rethink the movie.  Now it's hard to find anyone who's filling to admit they liked the ""Blair Witch Project"".  Why do I mention that?  Because the story's nearly the same when it comes to the near universal praise of Nintendo's ""Wind Waker"" game.Since ""Wind Waker"" is a Zelda game, and since the Zelda franchise is amazing, the ""Wind Waker"" must be amazing too, right?  Right? Unfortunately, no, but equally disturbing is how the gaming community answered ""yes"" to that question.  They went into a full-fledged campaign to convince themselves, and the public, that this game deserved a pedestal next to ""Link to the Past"" and ""Ocarina of Time"".  Only now, years after its release, do I hear consistent complaints about the game.  Below is a list of problems with the game:1) The sailing aspect of the game takes up at least 50% of the adventure and it is extremely tedious.  Nintendo didn't even attempt to streamline this process.  You can literally set your direction, put the controller on the floor, and sit back and watch the minutes pass as Link sails along to your destination.  In order to further extend the playtime of sailing, the user is forced to embark on numerous mini-quests where many must be performed numerous times through the game.  The most annoying are the ""fetch quests"" where you dredge the ocean floor for items.  *Yawn* Are we having fun yet?2) The game consists of only a few dungeons, and some of them are extremely easy.  Important aspects of the game were replaced with time-consuming fetch quests from the ship.3) The game has an unexploited storyline.  I can think of numerous examples of storyline elements that seem like they should conclude in something big, but completely fizzle out.  (Between this and the lack of dungeons, I am convinced this game was rushed to market)4) I might as well say it: the graphics are terrible but otherwise fit the overall-quality of the game.  The Link model is the worst: a massive head, massive eyes, and eyebrows that somehow float over his hair.  At least you spend most of your time staring at the back of Link's head.5) Before release we were told that the NPC (non playable characters) were going to be far more advanced than others we've seen in the past.  I have no idea where Nintendo got off promoting that idea because they are identical in sophistication to those in OoT and just about every video game I've played.  They certainly aren't as interesting as those from Majora's Mask.6) And I've just grown tired of games where you must constantly switch between the game and an item selection submenu.  Metroid didn't need this and neither did Star Fox Adventures.  I'd love to see Nintendo incorporate something that would minimize this behavior in their Zelda games.  The problem is especially bad in The Wind Waker because an entire item slot is wasted on the sail.7) Fighting non-boss enemies is extremely easy.  Just Z-target and swing your sword for a few moments and the green A button icon will change to a green star and flash.  Press the button when this happens and Link does an incredible feat of acrobatics and destroys his foe.  It looks awesome, but you quickly learn that this ability makes it extremely easy to fight nearly anything.  It also makes the game feel like its playing on autopilot and you are just a bystander watching.So this is a review for those interested in Twilight Princess.  Whether your itching for a Zelda fix while waiting for TP or have played and enjoyed TP and want more Zelda, I've just gotta warn you that Wind Waker is not worth the trouble.",Tedious and overrated

    Nintendo",2,This is the worst zelda game of all time for all nintendo systems.  It just doesn't have the charm of the other zelda games.  It gets really old and tedious spending all that time sailing across an ocean. Somehow sailing across an ocean and Link just don't match up. It doesn't stand the test of time like the other zelda's.  I played through all zelda games all the way through.  Here's my favorite zelda games in order.........1.  Link To The Past - snes2.  Ocarina of Time - N643.  Legend of Zelda - nintendo4.  Majora's Mask - N645.  Legend of Zelda 2 - nintendo6.  Windwaker - gamecubeSorry folks nintendo got it wrong with windwaker.  Hopefully they'll redeem the magic of zelda with twilight princess.,worst zelda game of all time

Also in the Pelterbug forrest cath two Slakouth because you can trade one for a pokemon I can't pronounce in Peltaburg city. In Peltaburg city you have to fight roxanne. She has a Lv. 15 Geodude and LV.14 Nosepass. Nosepass uses a attacked call Rock to mp it reduces your ablie and doese Damage!!! Use berries if you have them. If you have Treecko there is a guy in route 104 that gives a TM called Bullet Seed. teach that TM to Treecko. Bullet Seed is a Grass move that attacks 2 -5 times. It doese crital damage to Rock and fighting pokemon. If you don't have Treccko, another good poke for the gym leader is Dustox. Level up a wrumple to lv.10 and learn confusion. and Gust at lv.13.

I remember paying an exorbitant amount of money so I could play the Japanese version before the original game was released in America - and then playing it literally all night and into the next morning.  In fact, I just had fun playing it the other day on my Super Nintendo.Which leads to the question - why the heck does this cost $29.99?

It features four full Mario games, with extensive updates to the graphics and sound of each game.  Yet, if I remember correctly, that game sold for only $39.99 when it was brand new.

    Nintendo",1,"I've already reviewed ""Super Mario Bros. 3"" elsewhere, with both the 8-Bit NES version and the ""Super Mario All-Stars"" version.  I don't want to spend a lot of time and space on ""Super Mario Bros. 3"" specifically, but instead focus on this port (which is based on the ""Super Mario Allstars"" version).  We all know ""Super Mario Bros. 3"" is a classic title.  So, let's dispense with the cursory introduction of ""Super Mario Bros. 3"".  Basically, this is just a copy and paste job from a short blurb I wrote in my 2004 review of ""Super Mario All-stars"".""SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 3: The best selling game ever released independently, SMB3 greatly expanded the Mario universe with the introduction of several new enemies, Bowser's children (who was the mother, I wonder? Godzilla's ex?), and introduced cool new suites for Mario to wear. The game play was more expansive than ever, with cool new secrets to discover and eight tremendously large worlds. This game laid the foundation for so many other plat-formers, especially SUPER MARIO WORLD. While SMB2 felt like a weird detour, SMB3 took Mario back to the atmosphere or the original game, taking it a thousand different directions, and coming up with one of the best games ever developed. Although there were a few tweaks for the ALL STARS release (some levels got a few more coins to make it easy to access game secrets), like the other games this is tremendously faithful to the original NES release. That alone makes this essential playing""To further elaborate, there are a few cosmetic changes, but this is largely the All-stars port of ""Super Mario Bros. 3"" that we all know and adore.  Ok, we all love SMB3?  It's an eternal classic, etc, etc. Best game on the NES. Yada yada.  Everyone on the same page?  Good.Now, let's get to the problems of ""Super Mario Advance 4"", and yes, there are problems.  Well, one problem anyway.  And it's a BIG problem.  It's a little selling point called e-Reader compatibility.  What's so great about e-Reader cards you ask?  Well, I'm glad you asked.e-Reader cards features new content than can be added to pre-existing games.  In the case of ""Super Mario Bros. 3"", there were three specific types: Power-ups (which uploads specific items into Mario or Luigi's inventory list and can be used an unlimited amount of times), Demo Cards (which showed Mario speed-running, collecting enough coins to unlock a blue Toad House, or doing infinite 1-Up tricks - essentially, the hint videos of ""New Super Mario Bros. Wii"" six years before), and, wait for it . . . New Levels.Yes, you read right.  New levels.  Yes, Nintendo made NEW LEVELS to ""Super Mario Bros. 3"", and a whole new world called, appropriately enough, ""World-e"".  Note, these are not the 15 inaccesible levels embedded in the original NES ""Super Mario Bros. 3"" code. Nintendo released ten levels in Japan, the PAL reigion, and America, with two different series.  Fantastic, eh?  Awesome?No, not really.  In fact, as a Mario can you just feel cheated.  Why?  Well, for one, although Japan frequently gets exclusive content, Nintendo released a full TWENTY TWO additional new levels in Japan only, because (again, wait for it) . . . Nintendo discontinued the e-Card readerSo, what's frustrating here?  Mainly, Nintendo made THIRTY THREE NEW LEVELS (which, to put in perspective, is over a third of the original game, as ""Super Mario Bros. 3"" has 88 levels total), plus five re-made levels in ""Super Mario Bros. 3"" style of ""Super Mario Bros."".  These were levels 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, and 2-1.  Also, in homage to ""Super Mario World"" there are five new coloured switches which effect gameplay in different ways, but again only were released in Japan.Although many think Boomerang Mario first appeared in ""Super Mario 3D Land"", actually he first appeared in these one-off levels on the e-Cards, but (with only one exception, ""Slidin' the Slopes"", where you can use a boomerang on that one level only, just like Goomba's Shoe on 5-3) no one outside of Japan got to play as Boomerang Mario.  2/3s of the e-cards appeared only in Japan.Another problem with the e-Cards?  In World-e, there are three mushroom houses, each featuring three specific mini-games.  To unlock these mushroom houses, you must get Advance Coins found in the new levels (a precursor to the Star Coins of the ""New Super Mario Bros."" series).  But here's the kicker.  Outside of Japan, there's only enough coins to access ONE of these three mini-games, because there's not enough currency in the ten levels that Nintendo actually did release to unlock the other two.In Europe, the gamers got screwed even worst than the Americans, with the e-Card functionality completely disabled, inaccessible through normal gameplay.For Mario fans, this is beyond disappointing.  Nintendo put so much effort into new content, and yet do to poor implementation the majority of gamers will not get to experience these fantastic levels.  The e-reader was also a failure, so the cards weren't available for very long anyway.  Had all this new content been released in the game proper, ""Super Mario Advance 4"" would be the definitive port of ""Super Mario Bros. 3""; as it stands, there is only a vague sense of disappointment and incompletion for those who know about the new content.These are the true Lost Levels in the Mario universe, still commercially unreleased and widely difficult to play legitimately.  Note that the original ""Super Mario Bros."" had 32 levels.  These lost levels are 32 in number, along with three bonus levels and five remade levels.In the NES days that would be a full-length Mario title!

    Nintendo",2,"Kirby's air ride is one of those games that many will only buy because it has the name ""kirby"" in it, a household name part of one of nintendos premiere franchise. While nintendo is not one of those develpers who make racing games, 3 will be coming out this year. F-Zero GX (great game), mario kart double dash (which is getting alot of hype) and kirby's air ride, a game that just doesn't seem like it actually came out of the nintendo camp. Like nintendo couldn't have possibly ok'd a game that uses one button. But they did and to tell you the truth this game has little going for it.The game boasts of being a ""one button game"" which is basically saying we want to appeal to the younger crowd and get them involved in some of the older nintendo franchises. But after 2 days of renting the game my little brother was found playing the game, hands on the controller sleeping in front of the television set. And the 3rd day he was saying how he didnt like the game (and this is funny cause he's at that age where anything he watches that appeals to young audiances he will like no matter what - if its bad he'll like it, if its good he'll like it). This got me into playing the game. The game has terrible gameplay. Like I said before it's a one button game meaning it takes absolutley no skill to win, just knowing when to press the A button. If you know when to press A you can win. This means that I can play the game for years and years and my little brother can come up (after not playing the game in years) and whoop me cause he knew when to press A. And this doesn't just go for racing in multiplayer. In city mode you can pick up items and while picking up things (like the rocket launcher) if you pick up something it will begin a rapid fire of rockets giving you no control over where the rockets go. Why not use the Y button or the B button. This is just plain old silly, why cant you use the other 5 buttons on the GC controller to shoot a rocket, why? why? why?Kirby's Air Ride does have a few things going for it. The graphics and the colors are nice and bright and the music is good but can get a little repetettive. Plus there are plenty of cool feaures ot unlock in one of the modes giving the game a decent amount of replay value. Something many kirby fans aren't used to (remember how quick it took to beat the last kirby game.)Unfortunatley kirby air ride is the first GC game to support the LAN support for a GC game. This means that if you have 4 tvs, 4 gamegubes and 4 copies of the game plus an Local area network (LAN) you can play the game with 4 of your friends. This is nice but I did say unfortunatley. Unforunatley this game is so unworthy of this feature that you'd wish tht this feature came out on F-Zero GX or some other mutliplayer game on the GC.Kirby air ride is not one of those games you would want to buy or rent.

    Nintendo",2,"Let me just say of all the Nintendo franchises, Kirby has always been my favorite. Naturally last year when Nintendo announced that they had revived this game (it was on N64 but got canceled) I was very excited. So it was with that excitement I proceded to my local Blockbuster the week of it's release to see just what the geniuses at Hal Labs had in store for me this time. Words can not express the disapointment I felt the first time I raced. I'd heard this game was simple but this is downright retarded. Memo to Hal: there are six other buttons on the controller for the reason that unless you're playing a minigame in Mario Party one button can't function as everything. In this game the A button does everything. It brakes, sucks in enemies, uses their powers, and when over a boost pad initiates it. Let me explain how this simply can not work. While attempting to catch up to the Kirby in first I sucked in an enemy. Problem is A is also the brake so I slowed down and was relegated to third place. Now when I used my bombs I was forced to brake again thus putting me in fourth! Are you seeing the picture now? But wait there's some bad icing to go on the stale cake. This game has nine tracks. Whoever let this game ship thinking nine tracks was enough needs to be fired and hit. Many people will tout this games 360 unlockables as a selling point but honestly they do a horrible job extending this games already short lifespan. This is due to the fact most are utterly pointless such as the soundcheck (which at this point shouldn't have to be unlocked anyway). Other than the initial time getting use to the controls this game is also pretty easy. Once for fun I started a race and just set the controller down watched since Kirby accelerates automatically (which by the is another horrible idea). I finished second. Finally the multiplayer in this game isn't even very good which is bad for a game in a genre where the lifespan of the game pretty much depends on multiplayer. Overall, I will buy this game but only to own Kirby's first (and hopefully not last) Gamecube outing. However this will be when I can pick it up for fifteen dollars at most. I recommend anyone wanting this game to rent it and then should you still want it, wait like I'm doing.",The controls kill what could've been mediocre.

I still haven't mastered the controls completly. But multyplayer's pretty fun, so this is actually a good buy if you dont have any other 2+ games, or for first timers with the gamecube.

    Nintendo",2,"Kirby's air ride is one of those games that many will only buy because it has the name ""kirby"" in it, a household name part of one of nintendos premiere franchise. While nintendo is not one of those develpers who make racing games, 3 will be coming out this year. F-Zero GX (great game), mario kart double dash (which is getting alot of hype) and kirby's air ride, a game that just doesn't seem like it actually came out of the nintendo camp. Like nintendo couldn't have possibly ok'd a game that uses one button. But they did and to tell you the truth this game has little going for it.The game boasts of being a ""one button game"" which is basically saying we want to appeal to the younger crowd and get them involved in some of the older nintendo franchises. But after 2 days of renting the game my little brother was found playing the game, hands on the controller sleeping in front of the television set. And the 3rd day he was saying how he didnt like the game (and this is funny cause he's at that age where anything he watches that appeals to young audiances he will like no matter what - if its bad he'll like it, if its good he'll like it). This got me into playing the game. The game has terrible gameplay. Like I said before it's a one button game meaning it takes absolutley no skill to win, just knowing when to press the A button. If you know when to press A you can win. This means that I can play the game for years and years and my little brother can come up (after not playing the game in years) and whoop me cause he knew when to press A. And this doesn't just go for racing in multiplayer. In city mode you can pick up items and while picking up things (like the rocket launcher) if you pick up something it will begin a rapid fire of rockets giving you no control over where the rockets go. Why not use the Y button or the B button. This is just plain old silly, why cant you use the other 5 buttons on the GC controller to shoot a rocket, why? why? why?Kirby's Air Ride does have a few things going for it. The graphics and the colors are nice and bright and the music is good but can get a little repetettive.

    Nintendo",2,"I waited a long time for this game. I was very excited, having played mario golf on the N64, to have a similiar game in a handheld format. Unfortunately it didn't live up to expectations.Pros: great graphics, cool side games that help improve your skills, being able to build your skills through winning tournaments and the sound is decent. There's a storyline to follow: if you care about that sort of thing.Cons: The AI cheats fairly early on. I'll give you an example: The third tourney is played on a desert course. The first hole is a 470+ par four. I get a birdie on the hole and when they go to the leader board I'm in 4th place! Two people are tied for first with -3! THREE UNDER??? AFTER ONE???? That means they both got a hole in one on a 470 yard hole. Now THAT'S cheap.Another problem is dicey physics. Sometimes you'll get a ball to roll up on the green or stop one with backspin, but most of time the green appears to be made of concrete with balls bouncing yards into the air and shooting off the green at high speeds. The flight path of your ball shown by a glowing line that sometimes looks as though it's clear of obstacles but really isn't. You end up putting balls into trees, cacti etc. that look as if you should be clearing them. If a ball is close to the edge of a fairway or fringe you invariably are put in the rough. And the rough appears to be made of some hybrid of grass and superglue, a cheap way to make holes tougher. Then we'll move on to the course designs. Now I'm all for making golf games challenging but this is where the game really falls apart. Trees and cacti are simply put randomly in the middle of fairways with no thought towards realistic or asthetic course design, again, a cheap way to make holes tough. Then there are the &quot;hills&quot;. What they actually are, are shelves or steppes that eat up ball momentum and fail to represent real world physics or course design. Not too mention they make the course look silly. Putting is random at best, you can't rotate the green to read it, the game doesn't give you any info other than distance to hole and those stupid arrows that affect the balls motion at seemingly random intervals. A big hill will certainly slow you down if you're putting up it, but won't neccesarily help with a downhill putt. You always need to putt farther than the distance the computer gives you.All in all I was really disappointed. Maybe I'm expecting too much out of this game. I know it's not supposed to be a golf sim, it's an RPG. That's fine, I'm not opposed to adding a dimension to a game. However, if the basis of a game is golf, then it should play like a golf game, moreover, it should be a GOOD golf game. I'm not saying it should be Tiger Woods 2005, but games like Hot Shots and Swing Away do a fine job of incorporating stat building with a good arcade style of golf play.

23934,Nintendo,2,"Remember Shining Force I and II? Remember? Those turn based top-down view rpgs on the Sega Mega Drive with cool characters, heaps of cool magic and detailed combat animations?Well those were classic sega games that came out a full DECADE ago. Compared to those strategy rpgs of yore, Fire Emblem (this the 7th in the series) makes NO PROGRESS WHATSOEVER.It has lacklustre character designs, an overly wordy plot, a simplistic and boring combat system, a lack of difficulty and an annoying ""support"" feature which is somehow the developers attempt at adding replay value to this game.Overall, to the utter newbie whose only prior experience with these kind of games was with Advance Wars(which is arguably a better game than this one), Fire Emblem might seem like a solid choice. I agree, it IS a solid choice. It is also, however, a throwback of a game. A disappointing retread of gameplay that has been done bigger and better(on lower end systems I might add).How to begin? I will make a short comparison between this game and Shining Force II, which many of you have already played. Let me remind you that:*SFII had more exciting animations. In Fire Emblem, most of the art went to the character portraits. When it comes to the top-down graphics in battle, as well as the battle animations themselves, this game looks extremely poor for a GBA game.*SFII had more varied character designs.  FE's characters might look ""pretty"", but are pretty much all same-ish anime fare, color-coded hair and all.*SFII had HEAPS more: weapons, armours, spells, items. It was much more varied. Compared to this, all FE has going for it is a nice little ""weapon triangle"" system and your token herbs and potions. Not very exciting. In SFII you could cast spells like gigantic lightning storms which affect entire areas. In FE the magic works just like a weapon. You attack one square at a time. BO-Ring.*SFII had BETWEEN-COMBAT exploration. In FE, it's pretty much battle after battle. Consequently the plot is FORCED to be told in huge CHUNKS pre and post-battle. Not very immersive.*SFII was fun and worth replaying. Just go try it. In FE however, any semblance of replayability is in the form of placing different units next to each other and wait turn after turn in hope of getting new support combos. Wheee.It seems abit ridiculous for me to compare this hand-held game with a console game, but bear in mind that the console game in question came out more than 10 years before this. The game boy advance is both graphically and performance wise better than the Mega Drive in every respect. Why can't Intelligent Sys. make a game that fully utilises its potential?",Yawn.

It's great, it's something that challenges everyone and can be enjoyed by kids and adults.  Double dash is so infantile it sickens me!  The battlemode options are terrible!  Who wants to play on top of a gamecube?  That's the most uninspired thing I've ever seen!  And other venues such as cookie land?  I wanted to see sequels to the original, advances in the game but the same basic concept.  This game is for kids much like the N64 version, look toward the gameboy DS for a better mariokart. A serious let down.  If you liked the original at least rent it before you buy it just to see if I'm telling the truth here.",Comes Nowhere Near the Greatness of the Original

24902,Nintendo,1,"Mario party 5 is the worst out of all of them! The super duel mode is poor because the cars are slow, the capsules was a dumb idea because your never sure what your going to get and they dont do anything good at all. Most of the mini games are boaring and the levels are boaring also. They lost their touch! I asked my dad for it on christmas because I thought it would be better then all the other ones I played.

24909,Nintendo,2,"The main problem I had with MP5 is that it just takes so stinking long to play a game.  I also have Mario Party 3 (for Nintendo 64), which is the best game in the series, and it has options to allow you to skip the CPU's mini-games and speed up the movement of the characters.  MP5 doesn't have this.  What it does have is special &quot;events&quot; and bonuses on nearly every space.The result is that it took me about 75 minutes to play a 10-turn game the other night, when I can play a 15-turn game of MP3 in less than an hour.I do not like the concept of the &quot;capsules,&quot; either.  Instead of buying bonus items from stores, you get a &quot;free&quot; item every time you pass a gumball machine, and you have to pay to use it.  Problem is, the game asks you before every turn whether you want to use a capsule or not.  Annoying!Also a problem (in this game even more than the other MP games) is the excess of animations that slow down the game even more. The boards also seem to be overly complex... sometimes you'll go through an entire game and none of the players will ever get a star.The mini-games, which are the heart of any MP game, seem very dull.  Only a couple seemed not to be derivative of the previous games.  On the plus side, the graphics and sound, of course, are very nice, especially the 3-D game boards.

24911,Nintendo,2,"I love Mario games.  They're the reason I bought a Gamecube.  I rented this because I was interested in buying it, and I was sure it would be an excellent game, because the other Mario bros. games for the Gamecube are very good.  I was totally, absolutely disappointed with Mario Party 5, and I'm glad I rented it first.First of all, you can't just play minigames by themselves unless you unlock them.  (I think the board game part is ridiculously boring, so I'd like to just be able to play minigames.)  Unfortunately, the only way to GET the minigames is to play through the stupid board games!!  And get this--in this game, no matter what the mode, you MUST have 4 players playing it at a time.  That means, if it's only you and two friends playing the party mode, you MUST have a computer player in there also.  And guess what: the computer always gets a high roll on the dice, always wins the minigames (even if you set the computer player's level to easy) and ALWAYS gets to the first star before you do!!  It totally stinks!And don't even think about playing alone....  The only way for one player to play is to play the stupid board game party mode, against three computer players.  That means you spend a lot of time watching the computer play the game, because you can't skip past the computer's turns.  You have to watch them, EVERY TIME.  That is one of the worst things about this game.  Even if you have three human players, watching the computer take its turn always feels like a waste of time.Although the minigames have simple controls, they often involve extremely careful timing, or quick alternating of which button you're mashing, which makes things much, much more difficult.  And of course, then, the computer always wins--even on the easy minigames.The graphics aren't bad, but they're nothing special.  Not much to say about music, either, because if it's there, I don't notice it...it's all the same.

25257,Nintendo,1,"The only thing that relates this rotten game to &quot;The Secret of Mana&quot; is the name.  Everything else is just a rotten imitation of that fine game.  The graphics are well drawn, but poorly animated.  The music is lame.  The story is weak, and worst of all, the play controls are horrendous.The ring menu system from &quot;The Secret of Mana&quot; was a thing of beauty that let you quickly use items and equip your characters.  &quot;Sword of Mana&quot; has ring menus as well, but they're sluggish, and they flash for no apparent reason.  Also, it seems like it takes forever for the guy to swing his sword after you have pressed the button.  If you play it with the GameCube GameBoy Player, you'll even notice a bit of flicker.Another minor irritation is that no matter what kind of creature you kill, it leaves behind something that looks like a bull skeleton.  I could understand that in 1992, but it's 2003!  Surely ROM is cheap enough by now for the cartridge to hold an assortment of remains.I doubt that the original Mana team even worked on this thing.  In the opening, it mentions Brown &amp; Browne, which makes me suspect that Square is just a publisher for this game, not a developer.  They pulled the same dirty trick with &quot;Breath of Fire&quot; which was an okay game developed by Capcom, but it was not as good as a Square game.If they couldn't be bothered to do it right, they shouldn't have done it at all.",Feeble Offspring
25267,Nintendo,1,"Ther'es one specifc reason I don't like this game. Once you get to the final dungeon (the game is kind of like the legend of zelda) it locks you out and you can never go back!! If there's ever a game without any replay value, no matter how good, I would never get it...That's why I'm always cautious when buying my games, unless, of course, it's a puzzle game, etc. not being able to play those again would be like locking you away from the game. The last thing I have to say about this game is I got my hopes up that it would be like paper mario the thousand year door (read my review) but instead it doesent save at all once you're done beating the game! You're still in that damn final DUNGEON!!! Sadly, I might give this game a good rating IF it had replay value...Get this game if you don't care about replay value... ):",...

Remember how time passed during the day, and people might or might not be where they're supposed to be since they could be away from their house at that time?  Yeah, I HATE that.  And since Sword of Mana revolves around the same time based system, I HATE this game too.So in reality, I can't give you a true game review.  I can only tell you that I couldn't even play it due to being utterly frustrated at having to walk back and forth through areas to wait for the time of day to change to get something done.  If you can handle that, however, this may be the game for you.Not recommended for anyone.  Epic fail.",A disappointing entry in the Mana series... skip it.
25275,Nintendo,2,"I bo't this b'cuz I'm quite fond of SQUARE 4 the Final Fantasy series. I was sorely disappointed. While it started out great it dragged itself along. The two stories (Here/Heroine) were different, with the Heroine story being the most compelling. The game's about a world that was destroyed the wrongful use of Mana power by an evil tyrant Vandole who was subdued by a powerful Sword created by the Goddess. So now it seems the Vandole has been reincarnated intends to do it all again.The sad thing thing is that there are too many characters that have nothing to do with the overall story (The Mavoles for example) - not to mention just too many characters - period. What was the purpose of the trip to the Ice Castle - just to kill the monster and unfreeze it's people. You're sent helping people just to satisfy the ""journey"" aspect of the game but it contrast this game offers no real adventure or journey, and the endgame was equally as disappointing. I got confused of who the real enemy actually was and in the end I was even more confused because the game offers no resolution.The story itself was really uninspired as I had this game for a whole year without playing it, only to just ""get it over with"";  you will spend a GREAT DEAL OF TIME looking for Spirits, but if think the game or any character will TELL you how to find ALL 64 Spirits NO! GameFaqs will be your best friend for this game. A complete waste of time and money.","It took over a year  to complete, I was THAT bored."
25278,Nintendo,2,"I love the Mana series. I mean, the original Secret of Mana for the SNES is one of my favorite all-time games. It was an action RPG, good story and plot. So, when a sequel was slated for the GameBoy, I had to get it.Well, I had to get it a couple of years after it was released. Shh. Details.Anywho, I must say, I have never had so much aggravation and pain from playing a game. The AI is horrible, repeat, HORRIBLE! The story is convoluted, and the gameplay just downright frustrating. I almost regret the $20 I spent on the cartridge.GameplayI am going to get the worst part of this out of the way. The gameplay flat-out stinks. You start the game by choosing either to play as the Hero or the Heroine. The basic difference in these two is one is better at physical attacks, and the heroine is better with Mana (magic). Depending upon who you choose, the game will play differently. I chose the heroine.You start out (as the heroine) in a village, talking to your mother as you prepare to leave on a quest with some strange swordsman as a bodyguard. The village is attacked by soldiers that work for the Dark Lord. You escape, your village is slaughtered. You are taken to a manor by the mysterious soldier, where you meet the Hero. The manor is attacked, you escape again, and the Hero promises to protect you. He falls down, you run away, he is captured and beaten by soldiers.Fast forward, you wake up in bed after a nightmare recalling all this. The soldier is by your side, and you learn that you have been living with him in hiding since your escape. The story takes off from there. The Dark Lord now controls the land, he is evil, you must avenge your people, yadda, yadda.Oh yea, there is a mysterious sword called, get this, the Sword of Mana. And a goddess that turned herself into a tree to protect the people of the world. You worship this Mana goddess, because you are of the Mana tribe. It seems that you are the last of them.You now know as much as I do, and I have played the game. The plot is that horrible. You meet townspeople that tell you pointless stories or offer side quests that make no sense. While the story itself is a bit linear (run to next obstacle, defeat boss, possibly get an item for someone, etc.), you will often find yourself wandering a map trying to figure out where to go.Since save spots are few and far between, and healing in this game is a pain (either through the start menu, or using the appropriate Mana spirit, controlled through the right shoulder button on the GBA), you will find ""Your strength is depleted"" (i.e.; you die) happens at the worst possible time, with little warning. You then have to reset to your last save. Early in the game, this is horrible. The first cave you must travel, as the Heroine, has an enemy layout that killed me 5 times before I developed a strategy to get past the monsters.Bosses vary in the game from easy to insanely difficult. One boss in particular was on a spinning platform, and you could only hit him when he landed. However, given your level, your weapons only do like 1-2 points of damage per hit, and he has over 400 hit points. It took me 45 minutes to kill this guy. Needless to say, he hits a LOT harder than 1-2 points of damage. AND he inflicts status effects like blindness, so you may not even hit him at all.The next boss died within 2 minutes. Literally. I just ran and whacked.AI has to be the worst I have ever seen. During the course of the game, you will be partnered with various people. The battles in the game are real-time, and as long as your character is in a battle ""mode"", you can switch between who you are actively controlling by using the ""Select"" button. However, if your main character dies, you will have to start over from your last save. If you are controlling the main character and your partner dies, you can resurrect them. It is a bit unfair.The AI, though, even after I figured it out, stinks. There is a grid, with zones. You can either set your character to be aggressive or timid, use more magic or physical attacks. You position their icon within the grid to choose which attack style you would prefer. You have to manually do this for each new partner, otherwise, they will just stand there while you get yourself killed.Then, even if you do get the AI set to where they will attack, they will attack using a method that may do no damage. If they are better with Mana, they will drain their mana casting at a monster, even if it is doing 0 damage, then move in to attack with melee. Also, they get ""stuck"" on a map, and can't or won't follow you up a jump, across an area, etc. Once you kill all the monsters on a map, they will ""teleport"" to you, but that does little to help you if the monsters are ganking you.In terms of attacking and the like, it is standard RPG fare. As aformentioned, battles are realtime. You have to select the appropriate weapon/spirit to attack each type of monster. One monster may take a lot of damage from the Bow, however, another may take zero from the Bow but lots from a specific type of magic. It is up to you to cycle through each and attack appropriately.Towns are small, with standards like Inns, save points, general stores, and blacksmiths. Weapons can only be upgraded if you have special vegetables or fruits. Which you can grow with seeds that you collect in your ""Hot House"". Weapons can be reinforced with different materials that you find. So in short, you need to find materials to reinforce your weapon and vegetables to assign attributes.Lastly, levelling and the like is a bit confusing. You can choose a level in a class, and depending upon which you choose, you will gain in different attributes. You can choose to level any class at any time. However, your main class is fixed. So while you may decide to take a few points in say ""Warrior"", if you have the bulk of your points in ""Sage"", your main class will be like that of a Cleric. None of this is satisfactorily explained by the game.ControlsThe game controls, to their credit, are good. They respond well, and I have never had a situation where I was pressing the ""A"" button and felt the system didn't register the attack.Controls, for the Heroine, are as follows:Left Shoulder Button: JumpLeft Shoulder Button + A: MeditateRight Shoulder Button tap: Stat/heal boostRight Shoulder Button hold: Attack w/ spirit assignedA Button: Attack/ Select a menu optionB Button: Hold down to run/ Exit a menuSelect: Switch active character in battleStart: MenuFor fighting, you simply have to mash the A button or use magic. There really isn't much strategy in that regard. Menus are complex, though, and there is no way to quickly assign a hotkey. So, for instance, if you want to change which kind of magic, you have to scroll through menus, find the new spirit, set it, back out of the menus, then use the right shoulder button. It is just as complicated to change weapon types.Movement is like a standard GameBoy title. Not much to say there.Graphics and SoundGraphics are reminiscent of another GameBoy title, Golden Sun. The graphics are sprites, and the backgrounds are detailed and colorful. Particle effects are not really pretty. Your character is nice to look at, and menu pictures are clear, if not really detailed.Sound is standard GameBoy fare. 8-bit sounding and nothing overly special. I play with the sound off. There are different sounds for different game areas, but for the most part, you will be disgusted.There is no voiceacting. All conversations are based on text, and some story choices are text-based.Final SayThis title is cutesy, but the story doesn't make much sense. The gameplay is frustratingly unbalanced, the menus are too time consuming, and when it is all said and done, it seems like Square tried to throw so many silly side quests that serve no purpose into the title that the game borders on ridiculous. In the end, while it is a way to kill time, I wouldn't recommend this title to anyone, even the diehard fans. Save your money, and buy one of the many better GameBoy RPG titles out there, even something as text-heavy as Golden Sun. At least that one makes more sense.","Insert Sword, Twist, Ruin Franchise, Repeat"
25285,Nintendo,1,"The only thing that relates this rotten game to &quot;The Secret of Mana&quot; is the name.  Everything else is just a rotten imitation of that fine game.  The graphics are well drawn, but poorly animated.  The music is lame.  The story is weak, and worst of all, the play controls are horrendous.The ring menu system from &quot;The Secret of Mana&quot; was a thing of beauty that let you quickly use items and equip your characters.  &quot;Sword of Mana&quot; has ring menus as well, but they're sluggish, and they flash for no apparent reason.  Also, it seems like it takes forever for the guy to swing his sword after you have pressed the button.  If you play it with the GameCube GameBoy Player, you'll even notice a bit of flicker.Another minor irritation is that no matter what kind of creature you kill, it leaves behind something that looks like a bull skeleton.  I could understand that in 1992, but it's 2003!  Surely ROM is cheap enough by now for the cartridge to hold an assortment of remains.I doubt that the original Mana team even worked on this thing.  In the opening, it mentions Brown &amp; Browne, which makes me suspect that Square is just a publisher for this game, not a developer.  They pulled the same dirty trick with &quot;Breath of Fire&quot; which was an okay game developed by Capcom, but it was not as good as a Square game.If they couldn't be bothered to do it right, they shouldn't have done it at all.",Feeble Offspring
25295,Nintendo,1,"Ther'es one specifc reason I don't like this game. Once you get to the final dungeon (the game is kind of like the legend of zelda) it locks you out and you can never go back!! If there's ever a game without any replay value, no matter how good, I would never get it...That's why I'm always cautious when buying my games, unless, of course, it's a puzzle game, etc. not being able to play those again would be like locking you away from the game. The last thing I have to say about this game is I got my hopes up that it would be like paper mario the thousand year door (read my review) but instead it doesent save at all once you're done beating the game! You're still in that damn final DUNGEON!!! Sadly, I might give this game a good rating IF it had replay value...Get this game if you don't care about replay value... ):",...
25296,Nintendo,1,"Well, it's not Secret of Mana.  It's not even Children of Mana.  It's a totally different beast of a game.  I tried on two separate occasions to get into this game, but one single thing turned me off:  time actually passes during the day.Remember The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask?  Remember how time passed during the day, and people might or might not be where they're supposed to be since they could be away from their house at that time?  Yeah, I HATE that.  And since Sword of Mana revolves around the same time based system, I HATE this game too.So in reality, I can't give you a true game review.  I can only tell you that I couldn't even play it due to being utterly frustrated at having to walk back and forth through areas to wait for the time of day to change to get something done.  If you can handle that, however, this may be the game for you.Not recommended for anyone.  Epic fail.",A disappointing entry in the Mana series... skip it.
25303,Nintendo,2,"I bo't this b'cuz I'm quite fond of SQUARE 4 the Final Fantasy series. I was sorely disappointed. While it started out great it dragged itself along. The two stories (Here/Heroine) were different, with the Heroine story being the most compelling. The game's about a world that was destroyed the wrongful use of Mana power by an evil tyrant Vandole who was subdued by a powerful Sword created by the Goddess. So now it seems the Vandole has been reincarnated intends to do it all again.The sad thing thing is that there are too many characters that have nothing to do with the overall story (The Mavoles for example) - not to mention just too many characters - period. What was the purpose of the trip to the Ice Castle - just to kill the monster and unfreeze it's people. You're sent helping people just to satisfy the ""journey"" aspect of the game but it contrast this game offers no real adventure or journey, and the endgame was equally as disappointing. I got confused of who the real enemy actually was and in the end I was even more confused because the game offers no resolution.The story itself was really uninspired as I had this game for a whole year without playing it, only to just ""get it over with"";  you will spend a GREAT DEAL OF TIME looking for Spirits, but if think the game or any character will TELL you how to find ALL 64 Spirits NO! GameFaqs will be your best friend for this game. A complete waste of time and money.","It took over a year  to complete, I was THAT bored."
25306,Nintendo,2,"I love the Mana series. I mean, the original Secret of Mana for the SNES is one of my favorite all-time games. It was an action RPG, good story and plot. So, when a sequel was slated for the GameBoy, I had to get it.Well, I had to get it a couple of years after it was released. Shh. Details.Anywho, I must say, I have never had so much aggravation and pain from playing a game. The AI is horrible, repeat, HORRIBLE! The story is convoluted, and the gameplay just downright frustrating. I almost regret the $20 I spent on the cartridge.GameplayI am going to get the worst part of this out of the way. The gameplay flat-out stinks. You start the game by choosing either to play as the Hero or the Heroine. The basic difference in these two is one is better at physical attacks, and the heroine is better with Mana (magic). Depending upon who you choose, the game will play differently. I chose the heroine.You start out (as the heroine) in a village, talking to your mother as you prepare to leave on a quest with some strange swordsman as a bodyguard. The village is attacked by soldiers that work for the Dark Lord. You escape, your village is slaughtered. You are taken to a manor by the mysterious soldier, where you meet the Hero. The manor is attacked, you escape again, and the Hero promises to protect you. He falls down, you run away, he is captured and beaten by soldiers.Fast forward, you wake up in bed after a nightmare recalling all this. The soldier is by your side, and you learn that you have been living with him in hiding since your escape. The story takes off from there. The Dark Lord now controls the land, he is evil, you must avenge your people, yadda, yadda.Oh yea, there is a mysterious sword called, get this, the Sword of Mana. And a goddess that turned herself into a tree to protect the people of the world. You worship this Mana goddess, because you are of the Mana tribe. It seems that you are the last of them.You now know as much as I do, and I have played the game. The plot is that horrible. You meet townspeople that tell you pointless stories or offer side quests that make no sense. While the story itself is a bit linear (run to next obstacle, defeat boss, possibly get an item for someone, etc.), you will often find yourself wandering a map trying to figure out where to go.Since save spots are few and far between, and healing in this game is a pain (either through the start menu, or using the appropriate Mana spirit, controlled through the right shoulder button on the GBA), you will find ""Your strength is depleted"" (i.e.; you die) happens at the worst possible time, with little warning. You then have to reset to your last save. Early in the game, this is horrible. The first cave you must travel, as the Heroine, has an enemy layout that killed me 5 times before I developed a strategy to get past the monsters.Bosses vary in the game from easy to insanely difficult. One boss in particular was on a spinning platform, and you could only hit him when he landed. However, given your level, your weapons only do like 1-2 points of damage per hit, and he has over 400 hit points. It took me 45 minutes to kill this guy. Needless to say, he hits a LOT harder than 1-2 points of damage. AND he inflicts status effects like blindness, so you may not even hit him at all.The next boss died within 2 minutes. Literally. I just ran and whacked.AI has to be the worst I have ever seen. During the course of the game, you will be partnered with various people. The battles in the game are real-time, and as long as your character is in a battle ""mode"", you can switch between who you are actively controlling by using the ""Select"" button. However, if your main character dies, you will have to start over from your last save. If you are controlling the main character and your partner dies, you can resurrect them. It is a bit unfair.The AI, though, even after I figured it out, stinks. There is a grid, with zones. You can either set your character to be aggressive or timid, use more magic or physical attacks. You position their icon within the grid to choose which attack style you would prefer. You have to manually do this for each new partner, otherwise, they will just stand there while you get yourself killed.Then, even if you do get the AI set to where they will attack, they will attack using a method that may do no damage. If they are better with Mana, they will drain their mana casting at a monster, even if it is doing 0 damage, then move in to attack with melee. Also, they get ""stuck"" on a map, and can't or won't follow you up a jump, across an area, etc. Once you kill all the monsters on a map, they will ""teleport"" to you, but that does little to help you if the monsters are ganking you.In terms of attacking and the like, it is standard RPG fare. As aformentioned, battles are realtime. You have to select the appropriate weapon/spirit to attack each type of monster. One monster may take a lot of damage from the Bow, however, another may take zero from the Bow but lots from a specific type of magic. It is up to you to cycle through each and attack appropriately.Towns are small, with standards like Inns, save points, general stores, and blacksmiths. Weapons can only be upgraded if you have special vegetables or fruits. Which you can grow with seeds that you collect in your ""Hot House"". Weapons can be reinforced with different materials that you find. So in short, you need to find materials to reinforce your weapon and vegetables to assign attributes.Lastly, levelling and the like is a bit confusing. You can choose a level in a class, and depending upon which you choose, you will gain in different attributes. You can choose to level any class at any time. However, your main class is fixed. So while you may decide to take a few points in say ""Warrior"", if you have the bulk of your points in ""Sage"", your main class will be like that of a Cleric. None of this is satisfactorily explained by the game.ControlsThe game controls, to their credit, are good. They respond well, and I have never had a situation where I was pressing the ""A"" button and felt the system didn't register the attack.Controls, for the Heroine, are as follows:Left Shoulder Button: JumpLeft Shoulder Button + A: MeditateRight Shoulder Button tap: Stat/heal boostRight Shoulder Button hold: Attack w/ spirit assignedA Button: Attack/ Select a menu optionB Button: Hold down to run/ Exit a menuSelect: Switch active character in battleStart: MenuFor fighting, you simply have to mash the A button or use magic.

    Nintendo",2,"The Gamecube has been out for two years and now we finally have a Pokemon game for it. Unfortunately this might not really be a game. Lets start with some details and what this game does right first. Apparently Prof. Oak has been hard at work on a television network for Pokemon (does the man have a life?). Now you've been chosen to test this network and see if it's any good. Right when the television is delivered guess who suddenly breaks into your house? If you said Pikachu you're unfortunately correct (more on that later). So now you and Pikachu (who is apparently allowed to break the law) are now tasked to watch this network and see how it works. Each channel has different Pokemon themed shows such as PNF (Pokemon News Flash), Shop n Squirtle, Pichu Bros Party Panic Anime, and Slowpokes weather report. There are more but they're neither interesting nor fun to watch. Let's start with the good. The graphics are okay, not heavily detailed, but they get the job done with the exception of some of the Pokemon models looking like they came from the N64 games. You can occasionally go outside and see different Pokemon, which is pretty cool. The shopping channel even sells bus passes which can take you to different areas to see different Pokemon. Now the bad and there are more of these than the good. If you hate Pikachu this WILL increase your hatred ten fold at least. He always wants to watch TV! It usually takes an act of congress to get him to go outside and see the different Pokemon, which is arguably the best part of this game. Now some of the shows are okay but noo he wants to watch all of them including crap like Smoochum exercising for five minutes. It's like babysitting some annoying child. After a few days of this you will try to get him run over by the bus (sadly you cannot). Now my biggest gripe: lack of interactivity to the point you question whether you have a DVD or a game. Everything here has you watching. Sure you get to click on things but after that you only get to see what Pikachu does with them (which if you don't like him anyway you won't want to see him roll around with a ball for example). As an interesting side note (and this is neither good nor bad) this game runs on real time like Animal Crossing. So if you're Gamecube's clock is set correctly and you turn this on at three PM it will be the same in the game. At first this intrigued me but it soon became clear that this feature is very limited here. For example there are no exact time specific events such as &quot;Charmander only comes out from three to four in the afternoon&quot;. Instead it seems as though things are divided into three time sections each day: playing before noon, playing from noon to seven PM, and playing from seven PM to seven AM when the first section starts again. While simplistic it does keep the game from ending too quickly unless you mess with the clock. Each day when you save it unlocks things that when turned on in the proper time section the next day you can access. As stated before it isn't complex in the least but it does serve to stretch out what would be an otherwise short game. I know you're thinking I'm being too harsh on a game that's geared towards children right? Well it's because I know that tons of older Pokemon fans will pick this up and be disappointed. I almost did but thankfully I rented it first. Even at thirty dollars it's too much for what an older person would get out of it. However if you're a parent looking for good game for your pokemon-loving child this is actually a good choice. I could see a child enjoying it. Anyone over ten would be wise to wait until this can be picked up for at most half the price, I know I'm going to.",This ones more of a service to pokemon loving kids.

26515,Nintendo,1,"So... Mario vs Donkey Kong. Nintendo's latest shameless capitalization of a once-venerable series of games. I bit the bullet and started playing this recently, curiosity winning out over the recent experiences with Mario-branded games. Despite such tragedies of game design of the last 10 years like Mario Sunshine and Wario World, I still harbor warm feelings for the Mario games of the late 20th century, forgetting time and again that as their management and lead designers age and stagnate, fun, clever, original games like those are seemingly forever in Nintendo's past.The game started out alright, an interesting puzzle-focused twist on the main-sequence Super Mario series... they eliminated the venerable stomping-enemies-and-grabbing-power-ups formula, and replaced it entirely with simple logic puzzles in underwhelming levels usually no larger than two screens' worth. You can still jump around, but Mario's jumping range is no higher than about twice his height, which for Mario is absolutely pathetic. He also moves at a constant rate of speed no matter how long he's been running, making nimble jumps practically impossible, and skids randomly when he stops; I found myself constantly plunging into crevasses and falling off cliffs, wondering with utterly genuine surprise and confusion why the character was receiving commands I wasn't inputting. Probably the biggest sin of all, though, is the ludicrously short distance he can fall before pancaking on the ground and whining like a toddler. And if you're falling while holding something, he'll pitch the item across the screen once you've fallen a certain distance, forcing you to retrieve it once he's done feeling sorry for himself.Also, Mario's got the same voice actor they've been using in Mario games for years, Charles Martinet, who produces an entirely testicle-free whiny broken falsetto soaked in an Italian accent that rings less authentically than a Wichita Godfather's Pizza commercial. After maybe 20 minutes of gameplay, I was nearly in tears, begging the gods of video games to make him shut up... even if you're Mother Teresa, you can only really hear that ""Mama Mia!"" croon a limited number of times before a primal urge to exterminate mankind kicks in. And god help you if you let the rescued mini-Marios fall off the screen on the Mini Mario levels: until you retrieve all of them, which can sometimes take a while, they'll continuously shriek ""Oh, Mario!"" every second or so like starving lupine infants, producing a sensation that I can only describe as cannibalistic rage mixed with crippling nausea. One of the biggest letdowns in the game is the inability to pitch these mewling little parasites into an active caldera, forever silencing their demonic little voices.Donkey Kong himself is probably the strangest part of the game, though. During the opening cinematic, we see DK sitting on his fat simian butt in his house, flipping idly through channels, until he sees a commercial advertising some kind of weird mini Mario dolls. Then, suddenly, hearts appear in DK's eyes. I am not making this up. It appears to anyone with more than one digit in their age that Donkey Kong is either harboring a secret lust for everyone's favorite effeminate plumber, or has a sick fetish for plushie toys. The latter becomes evident as we see DK break into the factory and steal one sack full of mini-Marios, crippling the entire toy doll industry. Apparently in their panic, the ubiquitous, androgenous little toadstool slaves forgot they could just turn the machines back on and... uh, you know.... just, uh, make more. Instead, Mario comes to the rescue and follows DK through six worlds of improbable puzzles, rescuing one mini Mario on every level.So yeah, yet another failed opportunity to restore the Mario franchise to some mote of its former glory.  I'm sure Nintendo won't care as it'll still undoubtedly make them money, but it's yet another shovel working to dig their corporate grave.",This is why you don't outsource your intellectual property.

A giant ape who kidnaps Pauline (not Princess Peach), who Mario . . . er, Jump Man must rescue.  Donkey Kong throws barrels at Jump Man.

Donkey Kong!What is notable about this game and other early pre-Famicom/NES titles was Nintendo was actually a third party.  Once upon a time, in the early 1980s they licensed their IPs to other platforms at the very start of their foray into video games. Given the troubled fortunes of the Wii U during its initial launch cycle, and Nintendo President Saturo Iwata's adamant refusal to license out its IPs to tablet/smart phone devices, playing Mario and Donkey Kong on anything other than Nintendo hardware just seems bizarre, and that's because no one has played their Ips on non-Nintendo hardware (at least, legally), in decades.One of my first experiences with Nintendo games was playing Donkey Kong and Mario Bros on the Atari 2600. In 1983 Nintendo and Atari were trying to broker a deal and when that fell thru they brought out the Famicom that year and the Pal/US equivalent (NES) in 1985. Before that though they did publish their games on the Atari and some other hardware.The Gameboy Advance title in the Classic NES series is, appropriately enough, the NES version of Donkey Kong.  The problem with the NES port is that it's only three levels, and is missing the fourth level that was exclusive to the arcade (which is the pie level).By now, years after its release and the Gameboy Advance long superceded by Nintendo's subsequent handhelds, there is very little appeal in picking up this edition of ""Donkey Kong"".  First, it's only three levels long and can literally be beaten in ten to twenty minutes, with the only appeal being to go for high scores (which was appropriate to the market in the early 1980s . . . but even by the late 1980s, people just didn't care about high scores).Overall, the Classic NES series was fairly disappointing.  With few exeptions (such as ""The Legend of Zelda"", ""Zelda II: The Adventure of Link"", and ""Super Mario Bros.""), Nintendo released (in America, anyway), mostly very short gameplay experiences.

This game is horrifically boring in every way possible.Let's start with the graphics. They're good, and as you probably guessed, are 2D cel-shaded graphics for Mario and the rest of the world. Being a huge fan of Super Mario RPG for the SNES, I was extremely disappointed with this new appearance, giving it an extremely kiddy feel rather than the more mature feeling of Super Mario RPG. What a shame. It's comparable to the change in style between Windwaker and Ocarina of Time in the Zelda series, except that they were able to retain good elements and keep it excellent. Here they weren't. Still, the graphics are decent, and are part of the gameplay so I won't knock them down for it. 8/10The audio in Paper Mario is a mixed bag.

    Nintendo",1,"I thought the reason why we play games was to have fun, not exercise in frustration. The difficulty level is very uneven - most of the time you're doing same mundane silly tasks, but at every boss you will want to hurl the friggin GameCube out of the window. In addition, in some instances there is like 5 minutes of doing the same cakewalk from a save point to the cheapo boss, which naturally you're forced to repeat over and over again as it will take you MANY tries to beat the thing. What's with the rare save points? Ok, so I dont play videogames 3 hours every day, I play occasionally for fun, not to prove myself to anybody. I want to pick up a game, be done with it, and move on. Why not give me an option to play on an easier difficulty?Second, the game doesn't improve on its predecessor in any way. MP1 was a revelation. Even though its bosses were legendary (what with the idiotic 4 visor and 4 beam clutter during the fight), it still gave an incredible sense of ADVENTURE. Here, the light/dark world trick is more of a nuissance than anything. There's not much difference between the worlds (levels) either, most of the time you can't even tell which one you're in. There's too much back-tracking. You return to the same caves/rooms over and over again, for different items or whatever. At 70% into the game, at a puzzle where the camera switches on you so that you can't even see what you're doing, I had enough - and since I was bored out of my mind anyway, I quit. Definitely a game not for adults. the graphics suck, boring game",adults only read

    Nintendo",2,"First of all I'm not some raging Halo... Xbox or PS2 fanboy. I actually own and played this game. On top of all that I'm not a ranting Gamecube fanboy either. So, on with my review...Alright, so this is one of the worst games I have ever been foolish enough to buy... why? Well pretty much everything... I'll break it down for you...Graphics 8/10They look pretty good... but they are far from realistic, they have a very bright feel... not that dark, imersive feel that should be there. They are nicly detailed but I noticed when scanning stuff with your visor it's pixalized... and it's very noticable.Sound 5/10There is nothing special here at all. You got your standard monster-like sounds... nothing that made my jaw drop... oh and ProLocic II is there too.Controls 1/10This has to be the worst aspect of the game. WHY THE CLASSIC CONTROL SYSTEM!? By that I mean that you move with only one stick... oh this is f*****g annoying. It is impossible to simply turn the damn character... and to move around the 'beautiful' levels with any sort of ease. This is especially annoying in battle, it's fine when you actually lock onto the enemy but it's hard to just turn toward the enemy unless you go into... uh free aim mode (by pressing R) but you turn so damn slow that by the time your turner around the enemy has moved to another side of the arena. The should've switched to precision controls (or at least gave you the option to) which would've made the game worlds better. Other than that major flaw the controls are acceptable.Actual Gameplay 3/10 (this should cover everything else)Ok, so you have like 5 different weapons to pick from... which all look similar. So anyway, you travel through the SAME world the whole game shooting everything that moves and solving pointless puzzles... with the occasional, challenging boss battles. Ahh past all that comes another thing that annoys the living hell outta me is savepoints... where are they? There is a serious lack of save points in this crappy game. Worst or all when you die after a boss fight you can't simply restart the fight... nooooo you have to revert back to your last save point which is usually very long before that fight. If you wanna learn more about what you actually do read a fanboy review or a Gamespot review.This concludes my review... I'd say rent this game first. Trust me on this one, unless your some fanboy then just buy it as you'll like it no matter how bad it is. Final score 2/5",It sucks... sucks... sucks... sucks

    Nintendo",2,"This game is similar (and I mean really really similar) to the first Metroid Prime, except even more annoying.The translation of style from sidescrolling Metroid to 3d was handled beautifully.  Art, sound, level design, etc is all top notch, and the game sports some of the most impressive visuals to be found on the gamecube.  Beyond aesthetics though, the game falls apart.It's simply not fun to play.  It has a somewhat awkward control scheme that even after you adjust to, is simply subpar to games that were being made in the N64 era.  Nentendo tries to say that this is not a ""First Person Shooter"", but a ""First Person Adventure"" game.  Well, you do occasionally have to shoot things in the first person perspective, and it's handled quite poorly, leading me to believe Nintendo's statement is really just a euphimism for ""Bad First Person Shooter"".As already mentioned, the control scheme is poor.  You cannot strafe and move at the same time (unless you're locked onto someething that moves your view while you're strafing), so enemies (the vast majority of which are extremely agile) can very easily get behind you.  Aiming (which you also cannot do while moving) is so incredibly slow that it forces you to rely on the game's lock-on targetting system.  Unfortunately, too many enemies (especially bosses) have moves that negate your lockon targetting making re-aquring them a painstaking effort.  In addition to general slow aiming, your upward/downward viewing angle maxes out at about 30 degrees above/below the horizon, so when enemies get above you, it's very difficult to deal with them (as many flying enemies or bosses will often do).  It makes the game challenging, but not in a fun way.  It's challenging kind of like running a 20 mile marathon after having someone break both your knees with a sledgehammer.And then there's backtracking.  There is way way too much backtracking in this game.  It's one thing to spend an hour in a game exploring new environments without making progress, it's another thing to constantly be forced to backtrack an hour through previously explored territory to retrieve a single item, and then spend an hour getting back, only to get another item, and use it to backtrack an hour someplace else, etc.Making the backtracking even worse is the frequent forced encounters where doors will lock preventing you from leaving and you have to fight a particular enemy (Dark Pirte Trooper) until you either kill it or it leaves.  Either method takes upwards of 5-6 minutes, because like many other annoying enemies in the game, it spends most of its time being completely invincible.Metroid Prime 1 was a basically good game with some large flaws.  This game took it upon itself to be a copy of the first game, and increase the size of all those flaws without adding anything good.",This game didn't learn its lessons from the first Metroid Prime
28537,"by
    
    Nintendo",2,"Let me start this review off by saying that in 2003 I tried to play through metroid prime and rented it, I was only eleven years old and did not understand it or where to go. I was already a big gamer by this point and had played tons of gameboy snes and n64 games. It wasn't until 2011 that I decided to purchase Prime 1 and give it another run through.I always thought after the N64 and PS1 era that games began to decline in quality, sure there were plenty of great games in the Gamecube and PS2 era but how many of those were amazing? The quality of games like Zelda A Link To The Past, Ocarina of Time, Sonic 3&Knuckles;, Crash Bandicoot 2, Goldeneye, Pokemon Red/Blue, Starcraft, and Super Mario Brothers 3 are amazing. These are games that are timeless and never fail to impress me even to this very day. Metroid Prime, a game released in 2002 that I played 9 years later had an impact on me like those aforementioned games did when I first played them.An expertly crafted world with fantastic mythology, a near perfect map layout (that links areas together as players progress), diverse areas, fantastic controls, and a great level of challenge in both exploration and combat made Metroid Prime a great achievement for videogames.Needless to say once I beat prime I was really excited to buy and play through Prime 2. I expected something along the lines of the first game, what I got was a different story.When Prime 1 started we have Samus entering a space station being overtaken by strange creatures and there is a standoff with the Space Pirates, a boss fight, Ridley, and you have to exit the whole thing as it self destructs. Samus narrowly escapes and chases it to Tallon IV, the world of the game.Prime 2's opening is Samus going to trash world because of ""strange activity"". While Prime 1 started  you with all this combat, action, and adrenaline pumping through you as you use the new powerups(before they are taken away); Prime 2 has maybe 2 or 3 enemies you fight and that isn't until about 20 minutes into the game. When you lose the powerups in the beginning of Prime 2 you wouldnt have even known that you had them because you never use them.Whilst Prime 1's gameplay was about exploration and combat in a single world that contains multiple sections linked up, Prime 2's has four main areas accessible from a temple that you dont get to until about an hour or 2 into the game because of pointless cutscenes and areas. Prime 1 had the player seeing the game and world through the eyes of samus, you had to scan and explore to gain information. Prime 2 feels the need to show you everything with cutscenes, whether it be a camera panning to a certain object or to show every new enemy. Either way it takes you out of the game and is distracting. Anyways, Prime 2's areas arent really interconnected at all, making navigating back to certain areas a headache. The worst part is that all the areas are so similar that their seperation doesnt make any sense. We have the opening trash badlands area, the trash desert area, and the trash swamp area, etc. Do you see a cycle? Having every single area in this game look like a trash dump drains any life out of the environment. Everything just looks grey and dirty and it's absolutely hideous. The lack of diversity is attrocious. The first one gave us Ruins, Lava Caverns, Ice Palaces, an industrialized Mine Shaft, and the inside of a crater which contained the deadly element Phazon. These areas were so unique, yet due to a great map layout their were hidden access routes to commute between them fastly. Nothing felt separated in Prime 1, just interconnected.So there are 2 main things that Prime 2 fails in comparison with Prime 1, so you are probably asking what the game does new? Well there is a whole Light and Dark World thing that is supposed to play a big part into the main game. While I was thinking this would be similar to Link to the Pasts great Light/Darkworld system I was wrong. I assumed there would be one big darkworld map to correspond to the lightworld. However it is broken up into segments that you have to use special portals to access it and to get out of the darkworld. There are some areas where what you do in the dark world effects the lightworld but the game doesn't make it clear. The Darkworld serves as an excercise in frustration as the player has to navigate through just to find a portal that transports them somewhere else in the lightworld.  While in the darkworld you are always being damaged unless surrounded by these light crystals. What you have to do is run through and take pain just to get to the next light crystal. Any game that forces the player to constantly take damage for no reason is terribly designed, there is no excuse for it. Being damaged and dying in the dark world does not help increase one's gameplay abilities. However, in a confidential game when someone is fighting a boss and takes damage it teaches them how to play better and they learn how to be better at the said game.People say that the Dark World thing just adds to the challenge of the game, but a challenge is something that can be surpassed not something that is absolutely 100% unbeatable. Its the difference between being able to jump over an oncoming car, or being nailed to the ground. There is no challenge in always being hurt, just frustration. The majority of the games challenge comes from boss fights in which the enemies have unrecognizable patterns, attacks that take out 1/4 of your health, and a ridiculously high amount of hit points. While this is an actual challenge because they are beatable, I realized that it isn't practice that caused me to defeat these bosses it is luck. When these bosses with brutal attacks just appear out of the ground under you or quickly boost into you randomly you literally cant do anything to avoid being hit. You have to be lucky that these they dont appear or rush right into you and if that doesn't happen enough times and you are able to stay alive long enough to shoot them till they die, you win. Sure its difficult, but these bosses and minibosses (which are just as powerful as the main bosses) cross the line of something being a challenge to being overpowered and feeling rigged. Prime 1 had its fair share of difficult boss battles but I never felt that they were overpowered. Even the last boss which was very hard I knew I improved on with every attempt and thats what caused my victory. When I beat the Prime 1 bosses I felt a sense of joy and accomplishment, with Prime 2 I just felt like ""glad that's over.""Is Prime 2 a terrible game? No, there are much worse games to play. There is not one certain thing that Prime 2 completely fails in which ruins the game, it is a game that just has so many unpolished aspects to it that combined ruin the game. Especially standing in the shadows of Prime 1 this game is a huge dismantlement. I expected this game to tread completely new ground but with same mechanics (like what Majora's Mask was to Ocarina of Time), or be a carbon copy of the first Prime but in a new area. If this game was one of those 2 examples I would've enjoyed it alot more. If it treaded new ground and failed then i would give it credit for trying something new. If it was the same as Prime 1 in a new environment it would not be that ""fresh"" but would make for a fantastic game. Prime 2 is a game that falls in between those 2, it adds certain new things and tries to do some things differently yet it feels like a bad version of Prime 1 at the same time. I feel if this game was simply a new idea or a carbon copy it would've been fantastic.",Not even close to the level of polish or fun Metroid Prime has

    Nintendo",1,"I thought the reason why we play games was to have fun, not exercise in frustration. The difficulty level is very uneven - most of the time you're doing same mundane silly tasks, but at every boss you will want to hurl the friggin GameCube out of the window. In addition, in some instances there is like 5 minutes of doing the same cakewalk from a save point to the cheapo boss, which naturally you're forced to repeat over and over again as it will take you MANY tries to beat the thing. What's with the rare save points? Ok, so I dont play videogames 3 hours every day, I play occasionally for fun, not to prove myself to anybody. I want to pick up a game, be done with it, and move on. Why not give me an option to play on an easier difficulty?Second, the game doesn't improve on its predecessor in any way. MP1 was a revelation. Even though its bosses were legendary (what with the idiotic 4 visor and 4 beam clutter during the fight), it still gave an incredible sense of ADVENTURE. Here, the light/dark world trick is more of a nuissance than anything. There's not much difference between the worlds (levels) either, most of the time you can't even tell which one you're in. There's too much back-tracking. You return to the same caves/rooms over and over again, for different items or whatever. At 70% into the game, at a puzzle where the camera switches on you so that you can't even see what you're doing, I had enough - and since I was bored out of my mind anyway, I quit. Definitely a game not for adults. the graphics suck, boring game",adults only read

    Nintendo",2,"First of all I'm not some raging Halo... Xbox or PS2 fanboy. I actually own and played this game. On top of all that I'm not a ranting Gamecube fanboy either. So, on with my review...Alright, so this is one of the worst games I have ever been foolish enough to buy... why? Well pretty much everything... I'll break it down for you...Graphics 8/10They look pretty good... but they are far from realistic, they have a very bright feel... not that dark, imersive feel that should be there. They are nicly detailed but I noticed when scanning stuff with your visor it's pixalized... and it's very noticable.Sound 5/10There is nothing special here at all. You got your standard monster-like sounds... nothing that made my jaw drop... oh and ProLocic II is there too.Controls 1/10This has to be the worst aspect of the game. WHY THE CLASSIC CONTROL SYSTEM!? By that I mean that you move with only one stick... oh this is f*****g annoying. It is impossible to simply turn the damn character... and to move around the 'beautiful' levels with any sort of ease. This is especially annoying in battle, it's fine when you actually lock onto the enemy but it's hard to just turn toward the enemy unless you go into... uh free aim mode (by pressing R) but you turn so damn slow that by the time your turner around the enemy has moved to another side of the arena. The should've switched to precision controls (or at least gave you the option to) which would've made the game worlds better. Other than that major flaw the controls are acceptable.Actual Gameplay 3/10 (this should cover everything else)Ok, so you have like 5 different weapons to pick from... which all look similar. So anyway, you travel through the SAME world the whole game shooting everything that moves and solving pointless puzzles... with the occasional, challenging boss battles. Ahh past all that comes another thing that annoys the living hell outta me is savepoints... where are they? There is a serious lack of save points in this crappy game. Worst or all when you die after a boss fight you can't simply restart the fight... nooooo you have to revert back to your last save point which is usually very long before that fight. If you wanna learn more about what you actually do read a fanboy review or a Gamespot review.This concludes my review... I'd say rent this game first. Trust me on this one, unless your some fanboy then just buy it as you'll like it no matter how bad it is. Final score 2/5",It sucks... sucks... sucks... sucks

    Nintendo",2,"This game is similar (and I mean really really similar) to the first Metroid Prime, except even more annoying.The translation of style from sidescrolling Metroid to 3d was handled beautifully.  Art, sound, level design, etc is all top notch, and the game sports some of the most impressive visuals to be found on the gamecube.  Beyond aesthetics though, the game falls apart.It's simply not fun to play.  It has a somewhat awkward control scheme that even after you adjust to, is simply subpar to games that were being made in the N64 era.  Nentendo tries to say that this is not a ""First Person Shooter"", but a ""First Person Adventure"" game.  Well, you do occasionally have to shoot things in the first person perspective, and it's handled quite poorly, leading me to believe Nintendo's statement is really just a euphimism for ""Bad First Person Shooter"".As already mentioned, the control scheme is poor.  You cannot strafe and move at the same time (unless you're locked onto someething that moves your view while you're strafing), so enemies (the vast majority of which are extremely agile) can very easily get behind you.  Aiming (which you also cannot do while moving) is so incredibly slow that it forces you to rely on the game's lock-on targetting system.  Unfortunately, too many enemies (especially bosses) have moves that negate your lockon targetting making re-aquring them a painstaking effort.  In addition to general slow aiming, your upward/downward viewing angle maxes out at about 30 degrees above/below the horizon, so when enemies get above you, it's very difficult to deal with them (as many flying enemies or bosses will often do).  It makes the game challenging, but not in a fun way.  It's challenging kind of like running a 20 mile marathon after having someone break both your knees with a sledgehammer.And then there's backtracking.  There is way way too much backtracking in this game.  It's one thing to spend an hour in a game exploring new environments without making progress, it's another thing to constantly be forced to backtrack an hour through previously explored territory to retrieve a single item, and then spend an hour getting back, only to get another item, and use it to backtrack an hour someplace else, etc.Making the backtracking even worse is the frequent forced encounters where doors will lock preventing you from leaving and you have to fight a particular enemy (Dark Pirte Trooper) until you either kill it or it leaves.  Either method takes upwards of 5-6 minutes, because like many other annoying enemies in the game, it spends most of its time being completely invincible.Metroid Prime 1 was a basically good game with some large flaws.  This game took it upon itself to be a copy of the first game, and increase the size of all those flaws without adding anything good.",This game didn't learn its lessons from the first Metroid Prime

    Nintendo",2,"Let me start this review off by saying that in 2003 I tried to play through metroid prime and rented it, I was only eleven years old and did not understand it or where to go. I was already a big gamer by this point and had played tons of gameboy snes and n64 games. It wasn't until 2011 that I decided to purchase Prime 1 and give it another run through.I always thought after the N64 and PS1 era that games began to decline in quality, sure there were plenty of great games in the Gamecube and PS2 era but how many of those were amazing? The quality of games like Zelda A Link To The Past, Ocarina of Time, Sonic 3&Knuckles;, Crash Bandicoot 2, Goldeneye, Pokemon Red/Blue, Starcraft, and Super Mario Brothers 3 are amazing. These are games that are timeless and never fail to impress me even to this very day. Metroid Prime, a game released in 2002 that I played 9 years later had an impact on me like those aforementioned games did when I first played them.An expertly crafted world with fantastic mythology, a near perfect map layout (that links areas together as players progress), diverse areas, fantastic controls, and a great level of challenge in both exploration and combat made Metroid Prime a great achievement for videogames.Needless to say once I beat prime I was really excited to buy and play through Prime 2. I expected something along the lines of the first game, what I got was a different story.When Prime 1 started we have Samus entering a space station being overtaken by strange creatures and there is a standoff with the Space Pirates, a boss fight, Ridley, and you have to exit the whole thing as it self destructs. Samus narrowly escapes and chases it to Tallon IV, the world of the game.Prime 2's opening is Samus going to trash world because of ""strange activity"". While Prime 1 started  you with all this combat, action, and adrenaline pumping through you as you use the new powerups(before they are taken away); Prime 2 has maybe 2 or 3 enemies you fight and that isn't until about 20 minutes into the game. When you lose the powerups in the beginning of Prime 2 you wouldnt have even known that you had them because you never use them.Whilst Prime 1's gameplay was about exploration and combat in a single world that contains multiple sections linked up, Prime 2's has four main areas accessible from a temple that you dont get to until about an hour or 2 into the game because of pointless cutscenes and areas. Prime 1 had the player seeing the game and world through the eyes of samus, you had to scan and explore to gain information. Prime 2 feels the need to show you everything with cutscenes, whether it be a camera panning to a certain object or to show every new enemy. Either way it takes you out of the game and is distracting. Anyways, Prime 2's areas arent really interconnected at all, making navigating back to certain areas a headache. The worst part is that all the areas are so similar that their seperation doesnt make any sense. We have the opening trash badlands area, the trash desert area, and the trash swamp area, etc. Do you see a cycle? Having every single area in this game look like a trash dump drains any life out of the environment. Everything just looks grey and dirty and it's absolutely hideous. The lack of diversity is attrocious. The first one gave us Ruins, Lava Caverns, Ice Palaces, an industrialized Mine Shaft, and the inside of a crater which contained the deadly element Phazon. These areas were so unique, yet due to a great map layout their were hidden access routes to commute between them fastly. Nothing felt separated in Prime 1, just interconnected.So there are 2 main things that Prime 2 fails in comparison with Prime 1, so you are probably asking what the game does new? Well there is a whole Light and Dark World thing that is supposed to play a big part into the main game. While I was thinking this would be similar to Link to the Pasts great Light/Darkworld system I was wrong. I assumed there would be one big darkworld map to correspond to the lightworld. However it is broken up into segments that you have to use special portals to access it and to get out of the darkworld. There are some areas where what you do in the dark world effects the lightworld but the game doesn't make it clear. The Darkworld serves as an excercise in frustration as the player has to navigate through just to find a portal that transports them somewhere else in the lightworld.  While in the darkworld you are always being damaged unless surrounded by these light crystals. What you have to do is run through and take pain just to get to the next light crystal. Any game that forces the player to constantly take damage for no reason is terribly designed, there is no excuse for it. Being damaged and dying in the dark world does not help increase one's gameplay abilities. However, in a confidential game when someone is fighting a boss and takes damage it teaches them how to play better and they learn how to be better at the said game.People say that the Dark World thing just adds to the challenge of the game, but a challenge is something that can be surpassed not something that is absolutely 100% unbeatable. Its the difference between being able to jump over an oncoming car, or being nailed to the ground. There is no challenge in always being hurt, just frustration. The majority of the games challenge comes from boss fights in which the enemies have unrecognizable patterns, attacks that take out 1/4 of your health, and a ridiculously high amount of hit points. While this is an actual challenge because they are beatable, I realized that it isn't practice that caused me to defeat these bosses it is luck. When these bosses with brutal attacks just appear out of the ground under you or quickly boost into you randomly you literally cant do anything to avoid being hit. You have to be lucky that these they dont appear or rush right into you and if that doesn't happen enough times and you are able to stay alive long enough to shoot them till they die, you win. Sure its difficult, but these bosses and minibosses (which are just as powerful as the main bosses) cross the line of something being a challenge to being overpowered and feeling rigged. Prime 1 had its fair share of difficult boss battles but I never felt that they were overpowered. Even the last boss which was very hard I knew I improved on with every attempt and thats what caused my victory. When I beat the Prime 1 bosses I felt a sense of joy and accomplishment, with Prime 2 I just felt like ""glad that's over.""Is Prime 2 a terrible game? No, there are much worse games to play.

    Nintendo",2,"Wow, if you are a fan of previous Star Fox video games (not including the horrendous ""Star Fox Adventures"" that was one of the first releases for the Gamecube) I have bad news for you...The newest addition to the series, Star Fox: Assault, is a huge disappointment.  It is horrible.  SOOOOOOO bad.  I looked forward to this game so much, and now I play it, literally had to force myself just to continue and cling to the hope that it could get better. But it never did get better.  In fact, I think it is safe to say the game goes steadily downhill after you defeat the first boss.  Well, maybe not so steady, the ""fun"" of the game completely disappears the third or fourth time you have to wander around on foot and destroy some variation of ""shield generator"".  I am not going to get too much further into that in this format though.  I want to make a list of all the reasons this game is horrible.1) of the 10 levels I played through, there were only 3 where you spent the majority of the time in your plane.  The rest of the time you spent performing tedious tasks on foot or in the ""Landmaster"" on the horribly designed ground levels.  Each time you are on foot you start with one of the crappiest guns I have ever used in a video game.  It cannot kill anything in one shot, has a painfully slow rate of fire, and an even slower charge up time (the enemies that only take damage from charged shots fire at a much faster rate).  This could be solved by a handful of things.  A) if the controls allowed you to dodge, charge your gun and aim at the same time.  Most console shooters incorporate a 2-stick control system (like that in Halo or Timesplitters).  If you want 2-stick control in this game, you have to adjust to wacked out control in your plane.  By wacked out I mean it makes you control the plane with one stick and the camera with the other.  This is just stupid.  The one stick control leads to several control problems.  I'll get to that in a minute.  B) easily obtained weapon upgrades.  Not only are new guns (machine gun, grenades etc.) scarce, but once you find one, they have limited ammunition.  AND switching between them is a pain (using c-stick to change weapons!?!?).  It also annoyed me that you do not get to hold onto your guns from level to level.  The design of the foot levels is almost too bad to describe with words.  Everything is camoflauged.  It is very difficult to distinguish enemies, doors and important items from the surrounding area.  enemies aren't too bad in this case, because they show up on your radar.  But you are not given a map to any of these levels, so finding doors, and knowing where to go next is a huge pain in the ass.  AND as if the ground levels could get any worse, the developers some how managed to ruin the ""Landmaster"".  The ""Landmaster"" is a tank that was introduced in Star Fox 64.  It offered a nice change of pace in that game, requiring quick side to side movement and well planned hops to clear obstacles.  In this game not only is the ""Landmaster"" lethargic (it was very fast on the 64), but the hovering and rolling abilities are rarely needed (the dodging that required these moves in the 64 game is what made the landmaster fun).  There is really no need to have the Landmaster in this game.  This is the last thing I will say about the ground levels.  While you are running around on foot with your crappy gun, with the rest of the Star Fox team flying around above you, they STILL request back up from you.  They expect that you will be able to land multiple shots on multiple enemies at great distance while dealing with the phantom enemies that appear out of nowhere on the ground.  This requires you to go into ""aim mode"", you cannot move while you are aiming, lead one of the 3-5 enemies tailing your friend, and land at least several shots from your pistol on each one within approximately 60 seconds of the original distress signal.  After scrambling (and failing miserably) the first time this happened, I decided to let my team mates ""die"", because unlike in the other games, where you were punished for this and your team mates actually made a difference, your team mates never appear to do anything helpful in this game and return for the next mission no matter what.2)  The Controls are horrible.  I touched on this a little in the previous gripe.  But I still can't believe just how bad they are.  You cannot assign the buttons however you want to.  You have 3-schemes  to choose from.  One is good for the plane, but horrible for the foot/Landmaster portions of the game.  The second one is good for the foot and landmaster portions, but is terrible for the plane portions.  The third one is horrible for everything... I really don't know why they included it, it is needlessly complicated.  The challenge of a game should not be adjusting to the control scheme.  They could have saved all of this trouble and restricted the game play to the plane... I think everyone (myself and any respectable star fox fan) would have been just fine with that.3)  The story is poorly written.  The old star fox games did not have great stories, but they made up for this by ignoring the story element of the game.  This game tries to push the story as important, and implies relationships between various characters, which isn't a bad thing to do, it is just executed poorly in this game.  Most of the voice acting is second rate at best.  Falco turned is no longer a cocky rebel with a quick tongue, but a mellow ""surfer dude"" with an annoying attitude.  The girl fox never really proves that she serves a purpose other than weak attempts to seduce Fox.  Fox's voice switches between a Keanu Reeve's type effect where he sounds perpetually lost, and an over anxious ""I have done this a million times before I can't die I am the hero"" voice.  Which is annoying because in the SNES and 64 games he always came off as someone who is humble, but actively seeking revenge.  Oh, and Slippy is more homosexual than ever before.  All the new enemies suck too.  And I won't even get into the whole mess of a story where you team up with the ""Star Wolf"" team more often than you fight them...4)  Ok, so running around on foot sucks, driving the landmaster sucks, I would have thought they would at least salvage the Arwing portions of play.  I mean it shouldn't be too hard, there are only 3 levels that are exclusive to the Arwing.  Well... the flying sucks too.  It is slower.  You turn slower.  You can't do the useful ""turn on one side"" move to get through tight spots which makes the Arwings width a huge burden.  Whenever you ""spin"" to deflect enemy shots it makes this huge engine blast that prevents you from seeing anything happening ahead of you.  The ""rail"" portions of the level are plagued by the stage moving into your plane and enemies flying into the back of your ship (possibly the most frustrating part of the game).  The ""free"" portions are hurt by the speed of the Arwing (so sloooooooooow) and large, stationary ships cluttering up the battlefield (ally calls for help and they are on the other side of a huge ship, there is no way to get there in time, especially when your radar gives you no idea of how much distance is between the two of you).  You also start with no bombs, and do not retain the upgrades you find in the levels, as you did in the previous games.  This is very annoying in this game because the upgrades and pickups are very scarce, so you spend most of the plane levels with a crappy single laser (this sounds familiar...).  On top of all of this, the flying bosses seem recycled and old.  For example, the first boss is identical to Andross (main boss in the SNES and 64 versions).  While I'm on the topic of bosses, they are all very easy.  Not only easy to kill, but easy to figure out.  No thinking required here.5)  The radar is barely helpful.  In previous Star Fox games, radar was only used in ""free"" flight periods of the game.  When it was used though, it showed you EVERYTHING.  So you knew the direction and had an idea of the distance between yourself and friends and foes.  The area it displays now barely extends past your plane/landmaster/self.  So you have lots of colored dots lining the perimeter of your radar... this is not very helpful when an ally cries for help...6) This may sound stupid, but it annoyed me that Peppy is no longer one of the Star Fox pilots.  He has been replaced by the blue fox thing that you rescue in Star Fox Adventures.  He is still in the game, but hangs out in the Great Fox and *SPOILER* he dies.  Or at least he appeared to have killed himself at the point in the game that I stopped playing because it was killing me to see one of my favorite game franchises perverted like this.There are probably more things that I have missed.  This game is unbelievably bad.  I quit playing on what I am pretty sure is the last level because I was fed up with enemies flying into the back of my ship (in the ""rail"" portions of this game it is impossible to prevent this), and my best efforts being wasted by the stage shifting into my ship when I would turn at high speeds (it felt like the game was having to catch up to me).  I don't know why they (developers) keep tampering with this game.  Star Fox is not complicated.  Make enemies fly through in patterns, award points for shooting them down, have the stage collapse/change in front of you in time for you to get an idea of the pattern the gates will close, but quick enough so you will be forced to make choices (left or right, up or down, boost or break, flip on your side or stay flat).  It isn't hard... it isn't even that complicated.  Grounding me, Fox McCloud, leader of the Star Fox team, makes no sense at all.  The game is called STAR Fox.  Not RUN AROUND AND COLLECT STUFF Fox, or SHOOT BUGS WITH A SISSY PISTOL Fox, or LAND LOCKED DESTROYER OF FORCE FIELDS Fox.  It is STAR Fox.  STAR, like the things you find in outter space.  A game with such an obvious name should not be spent running around searching for alien spawn points.Despite the ridiculous controls, this game was still very easy, which just adds to the poor quality.  Bad story, horrible gameplay, really easy.  I will give one of the other control schemes another run tomorrow... But I doubt that will change anything.  This game sucks.  I am going to email Nintendo and complain, tell them how they are killing one of their best franchises... not really.  But it is true.  I should have known by the disgusting remixed theme song that played at the openning screen that this would be a disgusting remixed version of the first 3D game I ever played (going back to play the SNES Star Fox and remembering how its graphics were once revelutionary... wow, progress is funny).",SOOOO Disappointing

AND switching between them is a pain (using c-stick to change weapons!?!?).  It also annoyed me that you do not get to hold onto your guns from level to level.  The design of the foot levels is almost too bad to describe with words.  Everything is camoflauged.  It is very difficult to distinguish enemies, doors and important items from the surrounding area.  enemies aren't too bad in this case, because they show up on your radar.  But you are not given a map to any of these levels, so finding doors, and knowing where to go next is a huge pain in the ass.  AND as if the ground levels could get any worse, the developers some how managed to ruin the ""Landmaster"".  The ""Landmaster"" is a tank that was introduced in Star Fox 64.  It offered a nice change of pace in that game, requiring quick side to side movement and well planned hops to clear obstacles.  In this game not only is the ""Landmaster"" lethargic (it was very fast on the 64), but the hovering and rolling abilities are rarely needed (the dodging that required these moves in the 64 game is what made the landmaster fun).  There is really no need to have the Landmaster in this game.  This is the last thing I will say about the ground levels.  While you are running around on foot with your crappy gun, with the rest of the Star Fox team flying around above you, they STILL request back up from you.  They expect that you will be able to land multiple shots on multiple enemies at great distance while dealing with the phantom enemies that appear out of nowhere on the ground.  This requires you to go into ""aim mode"", you cannot move while you are aiming, lead one of the 3-5 enemies tailing your friend, and land at least several shots from your pistol on each one within approximately 60 seconds of the original distress signal.  After scrambling (and failing miserably) the first time this happened, I decided to let my team mates ""die"", because unlike in the other games, where you were punished for this and your team mates actually made a difference, your team mates never appear to do anything helpful in this game and return for the next mission no matter what.2)  The Controls are horrible.  I touched on this a little in the previous gripe.  But I still can't believe just how bad they are.  You cannot assign the buttons however you want to.  You have 3-schemes  to choose from.  One is good for the plane, but horrible for the foot/Landmaster portions of the game.  The second one is good for the foot and landmaster portions, but is terrible for the plane portions.  The third one is horrible for everything... I really don't know why they included it, it is needlessly complicated.  The challenge of a game should not be adjusting to the control scheme.  They could have saved all of this trouble and restricted the game play to the plane... I think everyone (myself and any respectable star fox fan) would have been just fine with that.3)  The story is poorly written.  The old star fox games did not have great stories, but they made up for this by ignoring the story element of the game.  This game tries to push the story as important, and implies relationships between various characters, which isn't a bad thing to do, it is just executed poorly in this game.  Most of the voice acting is second rate at best.  Falco turned is no longer a cocky rebel with a quick tongue, but a mellow ""surfer dude"" with an annoying attitude.  The girl fox never really proves that she serves a purpose other than weak attempts to seduce Fox.  Fox's voice switches between a Keanu Reeve's type effect where he sounds perpetually lost, and an over anxious ""I have done this a million times before I can't die I am the hero"" voice.  Which is annoying because in the SNES and 64 games he always came off as someone who is humble, but actively seeking revenge.  Oh, and Slippy is more homosexual than ever before.  All the new enemies suck too.  And I won't even get into the whole mess of a story where you team up with the ""Star Wolf"" team more often than you fight them...4)  Ok, so running around on foot sucks, driving the landmaster sucks, I would have thought they would at least salvage the Arwing portions of play.  I mean it shouldn't be too hard, there are only 3 levels that are exclusive to the Arwing.  Well... the flying sucks too.  It is slower.  You turn slower.  You can't do the useful ""turn on one side"" move to get through tight spots which makes the Arwings width a huge burden.  Whenever you ""spin"" to deflect enemy shots it makes this huge engine blast that prevents you from seeing anything happening ahead of you.  The ""rail"" portions of the level are plagued by the stage moving into your plane and enemies flying into the back of your ship (possibly the most frustrating part of the game).  The ""free"" portions are hurt by the speed of the Arwing (so sloooooooooow) and large, stationary ships cluttering up the battlefield (ally calls for help and they are on the other side of a huge ship, there is no way to get there in time, especially when your radar gives you no idea of how much distance is between the two of you).  You also start with no bombs, and do not retain the upgrades you find in the levels, as you did in the previous games.  This is very annoying in this game because the upgrades and pickups are very scarce, so you spend most of the plane levels with a crappy single laser (this sounds familiar...).  On top of all of this, the flying bosses seem recycled and old.  For example, the first boss is identical to Andross (main boss in the SNES and 64 versions).  While I'm on the topic of bosses, they are all very easy.  Not only easy to kill, but easy to figure out.  No thinking required here.5)  The radar is barely helpful.  In previous Star Fox games, radar was only used in ""free"" flight periods of the game.  When it was used though, it showed you EVERYTHING.  So you knew the direction and had an idea of the distance between yourself and friends and foes.  The area it displays now barely extends past your plane/landmaster/self.  So you have lots of colored dots lining the perimeter of your radar... this is not very helpful when an ally cries for help...6) This may sound stupid, but it annoyed me that Peppy is no longer one of the Star Fox pilots.  He has been replaced by the blue fox thing that you rescue in Star Fox Adventures.  He is still in the game, but hangs out in the Great Fox and *SPOILER* he dies.  Or at least he appeared to have killed himself at the point in the game that I stopped playing because it was killing me to see one of my favorite game franchises perverted like this.There are probably more things that I have missed.  This game is unbelievably bad.  I quit playing on what I am pretty sure is the last level because I was fed up with enemies flying into the back of my ship (in the ""rail"" portions of this game it is impossible to prevent this), and my best efforts being wasted by the stage shifting into my ship when I would turn at high speeds (it felt like the game was having to catch up to me).  I don't know why they (developers) keep tampering with this game.  Star Fox is not complicated.  Make enemies fly through in patterns, award points for shooting them down, have the stage collapse/change in front of you in time for you to get an idea of the pattern the gates will close, but quick enough so you will be forced to make choices (left or right, up or down, boost or break, flip on your side or stay flat).  It isn't hard... it isn't even that complicated.  Grounding me, Fox McCloud, leader of the Star Fox team, makes no sense at all.  The game is called STAR Fox.  Not RUN AROUND AND COLLECT STUFF Fox, or SHOOT BUGS WITH A SISSY PISTOL Fox, or LAND LOCKED DESTROYER OF FORCE FIELDS Fox.  It is STAR Fox.  STAR, like the things you find in outter space.  A game with such an obvious name should not be spent running around searching for alien spawn points.Despite the ridiculous controls, this game was still very easy, which just adds to the poor quality.  Bad story, horrible gameplay, really easy.  I will give one of the other control schemes another run tomorrow... But I doubt that will change anything.  This game sucks.  I am going to email Nintendo and complain, tell them how they are killing one of their best franchises... not really.  But it is true.  I should have known by the disgusting remixed theme song that played at the openning screen that this would be a disgusting remixed version of the first 3D game I ever played (going back to play the SNES Star Fox and remembering how its graphics were once revelutionary... wow, progress is funny).",SOOOO Disappointing

    Nintendo",2,"I usually like to write reasonably thorough reviews, ones that give some isight into the game rather than simply rant.On this one, I'll have to suspend my policy.  Star Fox Adventures was my favorite game for a long time, only surpassed by the Ratchet and Clank series recently, and I HATED Star Fox Assault.It seems like every 10 minutes you're facing some hard-to-kill miniboss.  They dumbed-down the look of Fox McLoud himself - he's much more blocky and pixelated.  I loved the velvety fur look from Adventures.  The graphics of what goes on around him are great, but what's going on is little more than running around and shooting, interspersed with flying missions that were frankly annoying.  And will the rest of the Star Fox team please JUST SHUT UP!Star Fox Adventures was aptly named, it was an adventure with great environmental variety, a real plot, and loaded with interesting concepts and mental challenges; but Assault is just senseless running/flying around, overdone bosses and little real imagination.If you're a fan of pre-Adventures Star Fox, please disregard. :o)",Star Fox Adventures fans beware

    Nintendo",2,"Metroid Prime is definitely overrated. Let me list all the reasons why-- The game totally rips off Mega Man Legends 2, a Playstation game released two years before this game came out on the Gamecube. The fire snakes that pop out of the lava, and the beetles that pop out of the ground, are two things in particular that are WAY too similar to aspects of MML2 for me to buy this is supposed to be some kind of coincidence.- The music is severely disappointing. The main theme song where the spaceship is located in the beginning of the game is a remake of the classic theme from the original Metroid (released in 1986) but done much, much worse. Oh sure, it may have sounded beautiful and epic back in 2002 to signal the realistic approach to the 3D movement video games were taking at the time, but nowadays, this particular theme lacks inspiration, melody, and any distinctive qualities. In other words, despite the epic beauty of the music, it's just bland and pointless to me. I'll take the original 1986 version with its inspirational melody thank you very much.- I mention this game feels like a ripoff of Mega Man Legends 2. It's also a ripoff of Quake II, the classic PC shooter. The environments and many of the dark areas feel *exactly* like Quake II, which makes me wonder why I'm playing Metroid Prime when I COULD be playing Quake II instead. Metroid Prime is nothing more than a corridor shooter.- The enemies you encounter are quite uninspiring for the most part. You have these suicidal bats that dart down from the ceiling, but they're small, boring and lack inventiveness. You have vines that pop out of walls and pretend like they're snakes- these are just annoying to shoot. You have wasps that swarm from hives and dive at you- it is VERY irritating to take out a swarm of these. There was nothing like this in Super Metroid. Nothing was irritating about the enemies in that game. Enemies are not only annoying to take out completely, but unacceptable to look at because of the bland way they were designed.- Boss battles are flat-out horrible. That gigantic plant you have to take out is underwhelming compared to the plant boss in Super Metroid (not to mention it takes WAY too much time to actually defeat, despite your best efforts to use the charge beam and morph ball).  The very first fight in fact is the worst one of them all- repeatedly and needlessly shooting wasps over and *over* again... ugh.  I'm not impressed at all here- boss battles are, for the most part, overlong and boring with no usage of creativity on the part of the developers.- Metroid Prime overall suffers from the same problem that Resident Evil 4 suffers from- the movie-like cinematic feel of the entire game, used for no other reason than a cheap attempt to make the game look as much like a movie as possible. I don't see the appeal of these kind of games to be totally honest- going for that grand and pretentious movie theater effect in video games has been done so many times by this point that it's just not worth the time or energy to create them in this way anymore, not to mention graphics aren't nearly as important as many gamers would have you believe- graphics mean crap to me.- The game is trying to go for a perfect 3D update to Super Metroid, but Metroid Prime is *nothing* like Super Metroid. How CAN it be??? Metroid Prime is just one of literally hundreds of generic 3D shooters out there where one man (or in this case, one woman) goes through a huge world, narrow corridors, and shooting and exploring... and before you say this game is all about exploration... let me respond by saying ""Not really"". The exploration aspect has been greatly exaggerated because you're honestly not exploring more in this game than you are in, say, Quake II and THAT game never gets credit for the exploratory features it implements, so neither should this one.- The game is so easy that you can literally just rush through enemies while running down hallways and actually ALLOW enemies to take off small chunks of your energy.  It doesn't matter because you'll have plenty of energy by the time you reach your destination anyway.  The game isn't hard enough.- Four words- WHY ALL THE SCANNING?  This is perhaps the most annoying thing I've ever seen in all the years I've been playing video games.  If this feature was implemented for storyline purposes only, I wouldn't have a problem with it.  But there's actually a purpose to all that scanning you do throughout the game- it effects achievements at the end of the game.  Who actually feels like scanning enemies and bosses every time you play this game?  Not me, not ever.  You don't have a choice though, that is, if you care about the achievements.  Terrible game development.- Platform jumps.  The excessive amount of platform jumps featured in this game are completely unnecessary, not to mention a hassle half the time.  I don't care if Nintendo fanboys defend the abundance of platforms in Metroid Prime by claiming this is not a platform game- that doesn't make the many platforms suddenly become nonexistent- they're *still* there and we *still* have to deal with them.  At least make jumping from platform to platform more creative like Mario or Spyro games.  That would help the game a LOT.I just don't like this game very much. It's boring, overrated, and not very fun. This game gets a 2 out of 5, despite the fact amazon keeps saying I'm giving it a 5 out of 5. Trust me, I'm not.","average, maybe even below average"

That idea could acctully have made this a great game but the thing I realy hated is that this game is like the hardest game ever. If you die three times your done for. Also the enimies are way too hard. Being able to use magic was preaty cool though and unlike the first zelda game you can see people walk through the towns instead of standing in one spot which was preaty facinating back than. I wouldnt recomend buying this game but if you do see it for like a dollar or two than go check it out. I think every Zelda game is worth trying out even this one.,what?

    Nintendo",2,"Ah, the original Metroid.  I love the original.  However, this is a waste of money.  Why could such a classic game be a waste?  Cuz if you buy Metroid: Zero Mission and beat it (which actually only takes about 2-3 hours for an average gamer), you'll unlock this game.  So basically you get 2 games in 1 with 0M.  But still, this game is fun, insanely tough, and it's just classic.  Zero Mission may give you all the updates to the Metroid series like wall jump and Speed Booster and combining of beams, but it's a cakewalk compared to the original.

    Nintendo",2,"Some reviews are easy to write, like a review for the GBA re-release of ""Metroid"".  We'll review the 2004 GBA title and then ""Metroid"" itself.  The Classic NES series can be seen as a forerunner to the far superior ""Virtual Console"" on the Wii, Wii U, and 3DS.  Unless you are a collector don't bother getting these games.  Of course, in 2013 when this review was written, only collectors would be seriously scouring the globe for such titles, as pretty much all twelve titles in the Classic NES series are now available on the far superior Virtual Console for a fraction of the cost.GBA METROID REVIEW:  With the advent of the Gameboy Advance, Nintendo decided to re-release select titles from the NES library of titles.  In Japan, the series was known as the Famicom Mini product line and in US/Pal as the Classic NES titles.  While Japan got THIRTY titles in all, the US/Pal regions only got a simpering twelve titles (""Bomberman"", ""Donkey Kong"", ""Excitebike"", ""Ice Climber"", ""The Legend of Zelda"", ""Pac-Man"", ""Super Mario Bros."", ""Xevious"", ""Castlevania"", ""Dr. Mario"", ""Metroid"", ""Zelda II: The Adventure of Link"").Critical reception to the series was mixed to say the least, with complaints about changes maded to various games and price issues.  Of the twelve titles released, only ""The Legend of Zelda"", ""Metroid"", ""Zelda II"", ""Castlevania"", and PERHAPS ""Super Mario Bros."" really justified the twenty dollar purchase price (which was the MSRP).  The other eight titles simply did not justify the high purchase price, generally due to short gameplay.""Super Mario Bros."" had already been re-released in 1999 as ""Super Mario Bros. Deluxe"", which featured superior features and an unlockable version of ""The Lost Levels"", although the aspect ratio was off due to the smaller screen size of the Gameboy Colour.  Likewise, there were also aspect ratio issues with this re-release of ""Super Mario Bros.""The two ""Legend of Zelda"" NES titles (along with the two N64 titles) had been recently re-released in 2003 as part of the Zelda Promo anthology that Nintendo literally gave away, which takes away from the appeal of the Classic NES series.  The only advantage of the GBA versions were they were hand-held versions of these early classic essential titles.  Both Zelda titles had been out of print since the NES days, so their re-release was fantastic, but I had gotten them already.So now we get to ""Metroid"".  Like the two ""Zelda"" titles, the value of the Classic NES GBA version was questionable to say the least due to then recent commercial products formally issued by Nintendo to the marketplace.  And unlike the two Zelda re-releases, the ""Metroid"" re-release did not even have that advantage of exclusive ""hand-held"" gaming that could have possibly allured a gamer to purchase said title.Barring the original NES release, by 2004 games could access ""Metroid"" in three different titles.  By using a special cable connecting a Gameboy Advance to a Gamecube, when you linked the GBA ""Metroid Fusion"" to the Gamecube ""Metroid Prime"" unlocked the NES version.  Also, after completing the GBA ""Metroid: Zero Mission"", itself a remake of ""Metroid"", the player again could unlock ""Metroid"".  I used both methods to play ""Metroid"" back in that era.  Because I owned (and loved) ""Zero Mission"", I passed on buying the Classic NES re-release.Why should you pay for something that you have gotten free as an unlockable bonus for in a far superior release?  Like the two Zelda rereleases I simply gave this one a pass.And that was largely the problem with the Classic NES series.  There simply wasn't much value to the games Nintendo chose to release due to the aforementioned reasons already given in this review.The real heartbreaker (and the one title I would have bought back in 2004 without a doubt) was Nintendo released ""Super Mario Bros. 2: The Lost Levels"" on the Famicom Mini series.  Unfortunately they did not publish that game across the waters, leaving it only as yet another Japan exclusive.METROID REVIEW:  ""Metroid"", the original 1986 NES classic, designed by Shigeru Miyamoto's mentor Gunpei Yokoi, stands tall in Nintendo's back catalogue as an undisputed classic and [the start of] a heavy hitting franchise to boot.  General consensus is while ""Metroid"" is easily one of the best of the early NES titles, as a series the game is rather rough around the edges.What can pass as market-ready game design in 1986 simply doesn't fly in subsequent years.  Like the 1992 title  ""The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past"" did to the original 1987 ""The Legend of Zelda"", ""Super Metroid"" took the basic blueprint of ""Metroid"" and so drastically and radically built and improved upon said blueprint that sometimes it's hard to go back to the original.In regards to my own play history, my parents bought me ""LTTP"" in the early 1990s and I played through ""Link to the Past"" countless times throughout that decade.  It was only in 1999 that I actually played through the original ""The Legend of Zelda"".  Having grown up with ""LTTP"", I found the original Zelda somewhat lacking, simply because LTTP takes everything that is so brilliant about the original Zelda and exponentially improves upon it.In the ""Metroid"" my play history is completely reversed.  I seriously began playing ""Metroid"" in 2002, having never played ""Super Metroid"" (other than a few brief instances in the 1990s). Aalthough I briefly played the game in the 1980s, I but never got out of Brinstar.  In 2002 I completed the game several times over and then went on to ""Super Metroid"".  To me, ""Metroid"" will always remind me of my college days.The game is a massive maze.  There is no map (which really isn't surprising since this is 1986).  A lot of the areas look similiar or have idential room layouts (this is especially true of Kraid's Hideout and parts of Ridley's Hideout, Norfair and Brinstar).  The similarities and copy and paste design of certain sections of ""Metroid"" can make it rather hard to know where you are at unless you are intimately familiar with the game, and can be rather disconcerting and confusing to say the least.  The game features substantial amounts of backtracking (which may or may not been seen as a flaw; personally, ""Metroid"" is by definition an exploration so some [the] backtracking is to be expected).There are frequent transitions from one room to the next (again, common in Kraid's Hideout which features a fast moving flying enemy) where an enemy can pass through a door as Samus exits/enters, thus sustaining unavoidable damage.  Samus cannot shoot diagnally and also cannot shoot while ducking, which can be rather challenging.  Samus is able to get two different projectiles: the Wave Beam and the Ice Beam.  Unfortunately, you cannot have both and the Ice Beam is required for the last section of the game, Tourian.  So if you get the Wave Beam during the course of gameplay, ultimately you will have to get the Ice Beam again (which is available in two locations and SOMEWHAT close to Tourian's entrace).Another big complaint is that, like Kid Icarus, Samus starts out very underpowered.  While being underpowered is not necessarily a bad thing, ""Metroid"" can be rather unforgiving to first time players.  Kid Icarus is one of the few platforming titles that actually gets easier the further you progress due to leveling up Pit's powers.  In regards to ""Metroid"", a significant draw back is how the energy refilling works.  You are able to get up to six energy tanks of 99 Health each.  However, if you die you start out the game with only 30 health and essentially have to grind your way up by killing these various enemies to regain your health.  The more energy tanks you have, the longer this process takes, and is rather monotonous.However, for 1986, the game is classic. While these gameplay issues can be frustrating, the game is tremendously fun, especially compared to what was on the market in 1986.  ""Metroid"" was an indepth, expansive game, among the first to feature multiple endings (contigent upon how much time you took to beat the game), filled to the brim with secrets, with some amazing sound effects (still love the sound for finding an item!) and music.  Samus Aran is also famous for being one of the first female video game protaganist antagonists in a medium dominated by [males] male characters, and her secret identity was a big plot twist in an era notable for its LACK of narrative.Yes, everything ""Metroid"" does, ""Super Metroid"" does better, while removing all the commonly accepted ""flaws"" of the original.  Still, for my money, I'll always love ""Metroid"" more, probably because, unlike ""The Legend of Zelda"" and ""A Link to the Past"", I first played through the original before going to the SNES title.  That may have made its rough edges far more paltable to me than had I been a ""Super Metroid"" junkie and then tried playing through the original.  I have a much more emotional attachment to it than the SNES one, despite how amazing the SNES game truly is.",Not much value unless you're a collector

    Nintendo",2,"THE GOOD: Takes you back to those early days of gaming - frustration and all; cool music, original idea... at the timeTHE BAD: Difficulty is insane; why buy this when you can get Zero Mission?DIFFICULTY: ImpossibleThe original Metroid introduced us back in the day to a game where exploration was key. Total exploration, without any clues or maps or even so much as a convenient save system (thankfully, this version saves automatically when you die). Now, while this sounds all well and good, the idea with the technology back then, was way ahead of itself. While it's great to provide such an idea, the challenge that went along with it was unpolished, mostly because controls back then just didn't provide an adequate job of what the game was supposed to represent. See the problem is that Samus back then jumped like a bouncy ball, a tap would do a small jump, but holding more than that would cause her to stay in the air longer than necessary, and since she flowed downwards like honey, landing on objects became an incredible trial of a person's frustation levels. This wasn't so bad at first, but once you get into the game and have to start landing on very small platforms, while trying to avoid enemy attacks, AND hitting enemies with your very limited shooting directions (later enemies move into spots which makes them near impossible to even shoot), it was an instant recipe for Anger Management courses that would later come. Now, unlike the remake, Zero Mission, Samus doesn't power up as quickly therefore making the game even unnecessarily harder. At some points you may scratch your head wondering where in the hell you're supposed to go, basically because you may have to blast some random wall you never knew needed to be blasted in order for you to progress.Though all this is annoying, the graphics were killer at the time and the music is some of the most memorable in gaming history. Of course this all only lasts for so long.In closing, this game really is unnecessary, because the MUCH better and more balanced Zero Mission is available for only a few dollars more, and this original NES game is unlockable after you beat that game. So this is pretty much a waste of money.BOTTOM LINE: Buy Zero Mission instead. It's actually, get this, FAIR, and you get more for your money.",The Virtually Impossible Original

    Nintendo",2,"Ah, the original Metroid.  I love the original.  However, this is a waste of money.  Why could such a classic game be a waste?  Cuz if you buy Metroid: Zero Mission and beat it (which actually only takes about 2-3 hours for an average gamer), you'll unlock this game.  So basically you get 2 games in 1 with 0M.  But still, this game is fun, insanely tough, and it's just classic.  Zero Mission may give you all the updates to the Metroid series like wall jump and Speed Booster and combining of beams, but it's a cakewalk compared to the original.  This is a good game, but if you want more money's worth, just get it with 0M.","Fun to play the original, but get 0M over this"

    Nintendo",2,"Some reviews are easy to write, like a review for the GBA re-release of ""Metroid"".  We'll review the 2004 GBA title and then ""Metroid"" itself.  The Classic NES series can be seen as a forerunner to the far superior ""Virtual Console"" on the Wii, Wii U, and 3DS.  Unless you are a collector don't bother getting these games.  Of course, in 2013 when this review was written, only collectors would be seriously scouring the globe for such titles, as pretty much all twelve titles in the Classic NES series are now available on the far superior Virtual Console for a fraction of the cost.GBA METROID REVIEW:  With the advent of the Gameboy Advance, Nintendo decided to re-release select titles from the NES library of titles.  In Japan, the series was known as the Famicom Mini product line and in US/Pal as the Classic NES titles.  While Japan got THIRTY titles in all, the US/Pal regions only got a simpering twelve titles (""Bomberman"", ""Donkey Kong"", ""Excitebike"", ""Ice Climber"", ""The Legend of Zelda"", ""Pac-Man"", ""Super Mario Bros."", ""Xevious"", ""Castlevania"", ""Dr. Mario"", ""Metroid"", ""Zelda II: The Adventure of Link"").Critical reception to the series was mixed to say the least, with complaints about changes maded to various games and price issues.  Of the twelve titles released, only ""The Legend of Zelda"", ""Metroid"", ""Zelda II"", ""Castlevania"", and PERHAPS ""Super Mario Bros."" really justified the twenty dollar purchase price (which was the MSRP).  The other eight titles simply did not justify the high purchase price, generally due to short gameplay.""Super Mario Bros."" had already been re-released in 1999 as ""Super Mario Bros. Deluxe"", which featured superior features and an unlockable version of ""The Lost Levels"", although the aspect ratio was off due to the smaller screen size of the Gameboy Colour.  Likewise, there were also aspect ratio issues with this re-release of ""Super Mario Bros.""The two ""Legend of Zelda"" NES titles (along with the two N64 titles) had been recently re-released in 2003 as part of the Zelda Promo anthology that Nintendo literally gave away, which takes away from the appeal of the Classic NES series.  The only advantage of the GBA versions were they were hand-held versions of these early classic essential titles.  Both Zelda titles had been out of print since the NES days, so their re-release was fantastic, but I had gotten them already.So now we get to ""Metroid"".  Like the two ""Zelda"" titles, the value of the Classic NES GBA version was questionable to say the least due to then recent commercial products formally issued by Nintendo to the marketplace.  And unlike the two Zelda re-releases, the ""Metroid"" re-release did not even have that advantage of exclusive ""hand-held"" gaming that could have possibly allured a gamer to purchase said title.Barring the original NES release, by 2004 games could access ""Metroid"" in three different titles.  By using a special cable connecting a Gameboy Advance to a Gamecube, when you linked the GBA ""Metroid Fusion"" to the Gamecube ""Metroid Prime"" unlocked the NES version.  Also, after completing the GBA ""Metroid: Zero Mission"", itself a remake of ""Metroid"", the player again could unlock ""Metroid"".  I used both methods to play ""Metroid"" back in that era.  Because I owned (and loved) ""Zero Mission"", I passed on buying the Classic NES re-release.Why should you pay for something that you have gotten free as an unlockable bonus for in a far superior release?  Like the two Zelda rereleases I simply gave this one a pass.And that was largely the problem with the Classic NES series.  There simply wasn't much value to the games Nintendo chose to release due to the aforementioned reasons already given in this review.The real heartbreaker (and the one title I would have bought back in 2004 without a doubt) was Nintendo released ""Super Mario Bros. 2: The Lost Levels"" on the Famicom Mini series.  Unfortunately they did not publish that game across the waters, leaving it only as yet another Japan exclusive.METROID REVIEW:  ""Metroid"", the original 1986 NES classic, designed by Shigeru Miyamoto's mentor Gunpei Yokoi, stands tall in Nintendo's back catalogue as an undisputed classic and [the start of] a heavy hitting franchise to boot.  General consensus is while ""Metroid"" is easily one of the best of the early NES titles, as a series the game is rather rough around the edges.What can pass as market-ready game design in 1986 simply doesn't fly in subsequent years.  Like the 1992 title  ""The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past"" did to the original 1987 ""The Legend of Zelda"", ""Super Metroid"" took the basic blueprint of ""Metroid"" and so drastically and radically built and improved upon said blueprint that sometimes it's hard to go back to the original.In regards to my own play history, my parents bought me ""LTTP"" in the early 1990s and I played through ""Link to the Past"" countless times throughout that decade.  It was only in 1999 that I actually played through the original ""The Legend of Zelda"".  Having grown up with ""LTTP"", I found the original Zelda somewhat lacking, simply because LTTP takes everything that is so brilliant about the original Zelda and exponentially improves upon it.In the ""Metroid"" my play history is completely reversed.  I seriously began playing ""Metroid"" in 2002, having never played ""Super Metroid"" (other than a few brief instances in the 1990s). Aalthough I briefly played the game in the 1980s, I but never got out of Brinstar.  In 2002 I completed the game several times over and then went on to ""Super Metroid"".  To me, ""Metroid"" will always remind me of my college days.The game is a massive maze.  There is no map (which really isn't surprising since this is 1986).  A lot of the areas look similiar or have idential room layouts (this is especially true of Kraid's Hideout and parts of Ridley's Hideout, Norfair and Brinstar).  The similarities and copy and paste design of certain sections of ""Metroid"" can make it rather hard to know where you are at unless you are intimately familiar with the game, and can be rather disconcerting and confusing to say the least.  The game features substantial amounts of backtracking (which may or may not been seen as a flaw; personally, ""Metroid"" is by definition an exploration so some [the] backtracking is to be expected).There are frequent transitions from one room to the next (again, common in Kraid's Hideout which features a fast moving flying enemy) where an enemy can pass through a door as Samus exits/enters, thus sustaining unavoidable damage.  Samus cannot shoot diagnally and also cannot shoot while ducking, which can be rather challenging.  Samus is able to get two different projectiles: the Wave Beam and the Ice Beam.  Unfortunately, you cannot have both and the Ice Beam is required for the last section of the game, Tourian.  So if you get the Wave Beam during the course of gameplay, ultimately you will have to get the Ice Beam again (which is available in two locations and SOMEWHAT close to Tourian's entrace).Another big complaint is that, like Kid Icarus, Samus starts out very underpowered.  While being underpowered is not necessarily a bad thing, ""Metroid"" can be rather unforgiving to first time players.  Kid Icarus is one of the few platforming titles that actually gets easier the further you progress due to leveling up Pit's powers.  In regards to ""Metroid"", a significant draw back is how the energy refilling works.  You are able to get up to six energy tanks of 99 Health each.  However, if you die you start out the game with only 30 health and essentially have to grind your way up by killing these various enemies to regain your health.  The more energy tanks you have, the longer this process takes, and is rather monotonous.However, for 1986, the game is classic. While these gameplay issues can be frustrating, the game is tremendously fun, especially compared to what was on the market in 1986.  ""Metroid"" was an indepth, expansive game, among the first to feature multiple endings (contigent upon how much time you took to beat the game), filled to the brim with secrets, with some amazing sound effects (still love the sound for finding an item!) and music.  Samus Aran is also famous for being one of the first female video game protaganist antagonists in a medium dominated by [males] male characters, and her secret identity was a big plot twist in an era notable for its LACK of narrative.Yes, everything ""Metroid"" does, ""Super Metroid"" does better, while removing all the commonly accepted ""flaws"" of the original.  Still, for my money, I'll always love ""Metroid"" more, probably because, unlike ""The Legend of Zelda"" and ""A Link to the Past"", I first played through the original before going to the SNES title.  That may have made its rough edges far more paltable to me than had I been a ""Super Metroid"" junkie and then tried playing through the original.  I have a much more emotional attachment to it than the SNES one, despite how amazing the SNES game truly is.",Not much value unless you're a collector

But its the Kinstones that ruin this game. The idea that to unlock areas you have to find a small piece of stone behind an unmarked wall to bomb then find the person whom it can be fused to made me loose interest so quickly. I planted tons of bombs, used up tons of time just to find a kinstone piece, then to have to find someone to fuse it with. Then I could continue with the adventure. Now perhaps if they add some sort of stroy as to what the heck these kinstones were or why everyone has them was never develpoed. And so my interest in finding them too waned.

I don;t play a zelda game to collect hundereds of kinstones and figurines. Who cares. I want a good story, cool dungeons, weapons and abilities that its not the finding out how to use them that are hard, its the using them correctly that is hard.The game also tries hard to rip-off four swords ideas with multiple links doing things single links cannot.

    Nintendo",1,"Well, let me just say that handhelds, for the longest time now, have bored me to tears.I own a gameboy color and a gameboy advance SP, and to tell you the truth, I hate both of them.  Why? The games.  To use the overused word, most of the games on handhelds are ""kiddie.""Handheld games are either boring, simplified 2d platformers, weak 2d action games, or cheap RPGs (Even Golden Sun, which is probably the best handheld RPG, is weak, IMO.)  I play too many RPGs to be happy with any of the RPGs in handhelds, because their stories are so weak, simple, and not well presented.  God, even Square-Enix has let me down (I love Square-Enix for consoles). Sword of mana is too simplistic to hold my attention for long (as opposed to the obscene amount of time I spend on console RPGs).  Even FF Tactics was a letdown, since the PSone version was much better.Now, let's look at the DS.  For one thing, I have always thought it funny that many young gamers call the touch screen revolutionary.  For one thing, I've had a Palm Pilot that plays game with a stylus pen for about 5 years now.  It's nothing new, and it is certaintly not fun.  Most of the palm pilot games are boring as hell, compounded by having to use the stylus (If developers couldn't find fun uses for a touch screen then, what makes you think they will now).  The DS is the same thing.  I'm guessing Nintendo was trying to create mouse-like controls by integrating the touch screen on the DS, and sadly, they failed.  For one thing, it's not a mouse, and the fact that as a handheld, you have to use one hand to hold it, while you try to control it with the stylus, means that the other buttons are pretty much a pain in the ass to try and use. Constantly having to move your hand(holding the stylus pen) and focus, away from the screen, to make sure you hit the right button.Second problem with the DS is the games.  It has none worth buying.  The port of the Mario 64 game is ok if you have never owned a N64.  I still have my N64 and Mario 64, and to tell you the truth, Mario 64 was a game I never did play for long, because I just got tired of the Mario type of gameplay.  Like I said, I like my games with a little meat on them, such as an interesting epic story.  It would have been better if they had ported Ocarina of Time to the DS, then maybe it would at least have a game that's fun to play; although, having already played it on the N64, I don't see why I would have bought it again, and having to control link with a stylus/touch screen would have been a total nightmare.Now, the upcoming games are also kind of sad. Most of them are games clearly aimed at a demographic consisting of 6-13 year olds.  There are almost no games that one would consider adult (and I don't mean blood and gore, but interesting stories, and engrossing characters- sorry, mascots are just not what adult players look forward to.)Nintendo, IMO has been on the downslide for such a long time now.  Each passing year, it becomes clearer and clearer that they just don't understand the gaming market anymore.  For one thing, gone are the days when players were content to play games that have no story, but are just random go fetch this coin, or get this mushroom, or capture cutsy pokemon, etc.  It's sad, that this is true in all their products, as my gamecube and collection of games can be a testament too. I only have about 6 gamecube games.  The rest of their offerings are either for kids, or sport games, which I don't like to play as much.If you are going to be spending any money on a handheld, seriously check yourself if you are over 16 and are looking at a DS.  Odds are that if you are over 16, you play PC games and console games, and nothing in the DS game collection will suit your tastes.$150 dollars for a system is not a lot, but it will annoy you, once you find that you have to spend 30 something bucks to buy games, which more frequent than not, are so kiddie, that you will most likely throw them away in disgust.Pictochat is ok, but then again, the 30 feet limit makes it kind of silly. I mean, techinically, you only have to raise your voice and you can talk to a person 30 feet away.  Unless your plan is to completely cut yourself off from human interaction that you would choose to use pictochat, when you can just as easily talk to that other person, then the uses of it are quite limited.The DS is rather big and clunky, which makes its lack of anything else but games will show.  For one thing, you will need to pack your mp3 player, dvd player, and DS if you want to be able to hear music, watch a movie, and play games.  Portable DVD players are not small (I have a 7 inch screen one) and unless you got an Ipod mini, your mp3 player is not that small either (especially if you have one that has a 4gb capacity).I do find that the clamshell design is fine, mostly because it keeps your screens safe. But, I'm pretty sure if they had not added that stupid second screen, the DS could have been a whole lot light and thinner/smaller.Not recommend for adults should come as a warning on the back of the DS box. the graphics suck, boring game",Another handheld for kids...

    Nintendo",2,"I have both a DS and a PSP and I have to say that the DS isn't as great as all these kids are saying.  It has an ok design (clamshell) but its real flaw is that the people who have $150-250 to spend are looking for more mature games.  I honestly enjoy Mario 64 DS and Tiger Woods, and I'm not saying that the DS is kiddy, but the games need to lose the cartoony look.  So far almost all the games have been mini game type games ( EX. Wario Ware, Pac Pix, Polarium, Feel the Magic, etc.)  There is yet to be a complete game, story and all, on the DS.  Mario doesn't count as it was released 9 YEARS AGO.  Spider-Man 2 looks like a Game Boy Advance game.Now, if you read the previous paragraph and you still want a DS, get Yoshi's Touch and Go.  If you want to know why it might be worth your money to go for for a PSP, read on.PSP is a great system, a good selection of games for kids ( Ape Escape, Hot Shots Golf, Lumines) and adults ( Twisted Metal: Head On, Tony Hawks Underground 2 Remix, and a lot of sports games) Though movies do look amazing, this Isn't why you buy a portable GAMING SYSTEM, and the music feature is flawed, as the transfer is a pain.  So, assuming that this is a game-only system, it still is a great choice.  It doesn't break like some of the reviewers have said it does when you drop it, and it comes with the sleeve for a reason.  If you use the black sleeve the COMES WITH THE SYSTEM the screen won't scratch.  There is a solid selection of games and three more come out on June 27th ( Dead to Rights: Reckoning, Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition, and Coded Arms)  All three of these games are more adult oriented as the ratings go from E10 to M for those three.  Grand Theft Auto is coming out later this summer, and 90 percent of the psp movies out right now are rated PG-13 to R.

    Nintendo",1,"This thing is a total waste of money. I borrowed my friend's for a week during the summer and the games sucked. They were either childish or not my type. Nintendo only makes games for either children or the Japanese gamer. They don't make games for the average mature American gamer. Also the graphics are no better than the GBA's. It's just a GBA with two screens, wifi, and a stylus. This machine also lacks features; doesn't playback video's, music, or photo's and has barley used it's wifi feature. The screen where you use the stylus also gets scratched from excess use. Only buy it for you or somebody else if you are either a child, lack good taste in games, or if you have yet to grow up and still like only E rated games. Seriously if you want a good time go get a PSP, they know what the customer wants. Finally don't believe what the Nintendo fanboy's say about it. They say the games sucks and are few and far between but they forget to mention that it was released many months after the DS and the good games are already comming out. They say it lacks battery power capacity it doesn't I use it a hour a day at least and I only recharge it every four days and the screen only scratches if you are heavy handed. I have mine since the release over half a year ago and I take it everywhere (vacation, subway, college, car, etc) I just wipe the screen off with the rag it came with and it looks new and never have I had a dead pixel.

But the Psp has better graphics and better games too. Also, the Psp can do more than the Ds. I see on point in the touch screen. You have to be in the same room as the other person for the pictochat to work. And even if you didn't, talking on the phone is much better. Well, Psp rocks!

    Nintendo",2,"I am here to review this system from a older persons point of view to help many out. I have played the DS a couple of times and tested with many of its ""options"". I have rated it in 4 categories that discuss different aspects of the handheld.1. Overall Quality- The Ds is a dual screen handheld gaming system.The dual screen is a great addition for the fact to protect the screen. The DS itself feels somewhat solid and has a nice build for  people as of myself who play systems for a substantial amount of time. Overall = 4/52. Graphics- This is where the DS falls extremely short. Even though graphics dont make the game, they sure do enhance in many different ways. The visuals mostly remind of the old Nintendo 64. Except that the colors aren't as vibrant. All games i have played so far have jagged edges and lack the polish of its rival PSP. Overall- 2.5/53. Gaming Library- Another aspect of the DS that falls short. This system was released here in the U.S in Late November. To this day there is a extremly lack of games availible on the market. I have noticed that more Advance games are being released then the supposedly future handheld out at this moment. Compared to the PSP this a total flop. The PSP has a wide range out already and have over 20 releases scheduled over the next upcoming months. Overall-  2/54. Extras- The touch screen personally to me is kinda of a waste but is an interesting feature. This is a solid part to this system. The Picto Chat on the other hand is worthless and so is the Microphone, since no games yet as i know of use these capabilities.Overall Perfomance = 2.5/5Nintendo has a whole lot of catching up to do to keep making a decent profit. I award them for staying with all other companies but this product seems unfinished and yet to be finished in the future.",A system for the younger audience

    Nintendo",2,"EDIT 8/15/05 - After buying the DS a second time and playing Kirby: Canvas Curse, which, for my money, is one of the most innovative games ever made, and the best platformer of the past year, and playing an advance copy of Nintendogs, I'd up my ratings to a 5 out of 5 for fun and a 4 out of 5 overall (some of  my complaints in the review below still hold true).  Overall, I would definitely recommend this handheld!Disappointment in the PSP led me to buying a DS today (probably not Sony's intention). While the system is more innovative than the PSP, it's still a huge letdown (one of the first from Nintendo). If I could change one thing, it would be the ergonomics of the console. The worst thing is how hard it is to hold when using the stylus. It physically hurts your wrist and fingers if you play a stylus heavy game for more than 15 minutes. The stylus control setup also seems to only be half there -- a gimmick with potential. Nintendo needs to either take it one step forward or one step back. As it is now, they're dangling in some weird limbo that's simultaneously too innovative and not quite innovative enough. I'm returning my DS tomorrow and will only consider buying a new one if:*It's lighter and thinner*It's easier to hold while using the Stylus*It has at least 5 good games and 3 great ones (of the 3 games I played only Mario 64 DS was great and I played that one almost a decade ago on my Nintendo 64 -- and it had better controls then. Metroid Hunters has potential, though.)*I don't have to turn it off and on when leaving a chat (what's up with having to reboot when changing the functionality of the system?)*It is online enabled with at least 2 or 3 online enabled games (Mario Kart and Wave Race would be a good start)I think Nintendo should consider knocking $50.00 off of the price by dropping the GameBoy Advance support, which would also automatically make the machine lighter and slimmer. Or keep it at $149.99, drop the GBA support, making the system thinner and include full PDA software (right now you get a non-interactive clock and non-interactive calendar). Dropping GBA support would then prevent Nintendo from falling back on its incredible GBA library, possibly pushing them to create an equally incredible library for the DS. I think the company needs to make the DS a worthwhile purchase, in and of itself. Metroid Hunters' full game not available until August 8th? C'mon Nintendo -- we need at least one killer new app. unique to the DS! The potential is there. I could see it in the amazingly addictive mini games on Mario DS and I could see it again playing Yoshi. The stylus could make for some of the most innovative, inventive and fun gaming since video gaming began -- if the big N would only take that extra step forward and made full use of the unique control setup they came up with.  As it stands, I think the DS and the PSP are both wasted machines. Until something better comes along (or until the DS improves), I'll stick with the Gameboy Advance for my portable gaming.",A gimmick with potential ...

    Nintendo",2,"Don't get me wrong here, but when I was waiting for the DS to come out I was nearly exploding with excitement. But when I actually got it I was disapointed. The sound is OK and the graphics are great on some games but everything else is pretty lame.Honestly, I think this system is a dual sceen brick. I have had two good games out of it, one of which was a remake of a N64 game. The touch screen is just an attraction to customers. How much does it use the touch screen other than the opening screen? What, 3 games? Most of the games are incredibly pointless or are just badly laid out. The features other than gaming are useless, or don't work. The PSP has at least one better game in every genre than every game on the DS. There are things on the DS that are better than the PSP, but really there aren't that many. Here is a rating of one to ten of It's features.Sound 6/10The soundtrack on most games are limited by a lot but the speakers are loud and don't get fuzzy.Graphics 5/10The graphics in Super Mario DS are a 10, but the rest aren't nearly as good.Multiplayer 2/10The multiplayer on the DS is lame so far, except for a few games, like Mario Kart DS, but other games are a lot less well done.Extra Features 1/10The fact that you don't have to keep fixing a link-cable every five seconds is useful, but the things like pictochat are useless. Why would you use some lousy stylus-punch in typing accessory to talk with people who have to be less than 100 feet away? The battery-life is sub-par with 9 hours to play your DS game with out it dying, and although is better than the PSP in that area, it really isn't in anything else.Overall 3/10To put it mildly the extra features made the system not worth buying. There are a few good games but not very many. That about sums up This dual screened brick.AfterthoughtsI will admit, it is hard to say something like that about Nintendo, but all I really want to say now is, I hope the next portable console by Nintendo is better.",sub-par at best

    Nintendo",2,"First off, I do think we can compare the two systems.  We always compare items.  I mean in the 1970's the tiny TVs with like 10 channels seemed cool, but many people today say why would you buy that when you could buy something much better.  Well, that is a comparrison.  I would say that the DS is ok but again, you can get something way better.  The PSP is a true masterpiece.  And you can't believe the people who can't spell claiming that Nintendo is planning to make these add-ons that don't exist!  I will now compare the two systems.  By the way, I own both systems and use PSP way more.Graphics:PSP: Equal to PS2 with 2.6 million colors and 128 bit graphics.DS: A bit over N64 quality wih over 100,000 colors and 96 bits.Movies:PSP: DVD quality with full length movies.DS: Well, according to one of the retards who wrote a review here says that they are making movies in Japan now but I can assure you that's not true.  Right now you have Spongebob.Music:PSP: IPOD quality and memory cards are less money than an IPOD with equal memory.DS:  Uhh, NONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Game Selection:PSP: Great games and wide selection.  When PSP released, they had more launch games than DS had total.  DS came out over four months earlier.  Games include:  THUG, MVP, Twisted Metal, Madden, Wipeout, NBA Street, NFL Street, GTA, NFSU, Midnight Club, Ridge Racer, Lummies, and FIFA.  Games can hold 1.8 GIGs and are $45.  That is only about $27 a GIG while DS holds 1.1 GIGs and is $35.  That is over $30 a GIG.DS: Obviously not as good of value as PSP games as I explained.  Games include:  NFS, Mario 64, Warioware Touched, and Rayman.Battery:PSP: 6 hoursDS:  8 hours (Well, they win at something)The touchscreen is annoying because there are no good ideas for it, or at least nobody has one.

    Nintendo",2,"I have been playing Mario 64 DS for a few weeks now.  I have played it long enough to now write about the controls with the knowledge that they will not get any more comfortable with extended play.With that said, I can say with confidence that the engineers who designed this handheld have doomed it to an early demise due to unbelievably leaving out analog control.  It is amazing that they would take the time to create a system capable of displaying beautiful and fluid 3D graphics (Mario 64 is amazing looking) but then utilize a control scheme last used on the SNES which specialized in 2D scrollers.  Just think of 3rd person 3D games you play on your home console..do you ever use the control pad to control the character or the analog stick?  I will bet you use the analog stick and could not even imagine using the digital pad.  The Nintendo DS asks (no make that demands) that we forget all the advances in 3D gaming and go back to the bad old days of digital control.  The ""virtual"" analog control offered by the touch screen is completely ineffective and amazing frustrating.  This system badly needed an analog control stick (like the PSP has) even more that it needed a gimmicky touch screen.  Basically the DS will be relegated to mini game type products and an occasional First Person Shooter (which stylus control could be ok), but any hopes of 3D adventure games is totally ruined.In closing, I compare Mario DS to an amazing looking Thanksgiving Turkey that is made of plastic.  It wonderful to look at, but you cannot actually enjoy eating it.Shame on Nintendo for overlooking analog control.  The saddest thing is that they will probably have to scrap the DS and come out with another handheld that has an analog stick. effectively screwing all of us who bought this flawed product.",Ruined by lack of analog control

    Nintendo",2,"I never should have played the original or this updated version of the most overrated Mario title Nintendo ever released.  The praise this game STILL receives in this day and age, not necessarily for its gameplay but mainly for its influence mind you, is staggering... and sickening.  Super Mario 64 never impressed me at all in the N64 days nearly 18 years ago when I was supposed to swallow the enormous popularity but intelligently never did, and it certainly doesn't impress me now.  Nintendo had a perfect opportunity to finally make this overrated lackluster game into something truly special from a gameplay perspective but they failed to do so.  They could have finally corrected a wrong that's been annoying me for the better part of two decades.You can play as not only Mario but also Luigi, Yoshi and Wario each with their own unique abilities.  You have to search for and pick up their caps scattered throughout the levels, often times worn by the enemies meaning you have to take out the enemies to obtain them.  These are nice additions admittedly and I honestly don't even need to tell you what these abilities are- you already know since they haven't changed in years.  Luigi jumps high?  No way!  Wario's powerful?  Get out of town!  Yoshi spits eggs?  I doubt that!  Yeah, you get the idea.  There's a few other things this game adds that's totally unnecessary such as gigantic-sized Mario that can smash anything in sight for a few seconds, an overused cheap gimmick that would soon explode in eye candy redundancy when the New Super Mario Bros. games would release, and those irritating rabbit chasing games which appeared quite often in the Galaxy series.  The one mistake the Galaxy series made was including so many rabbing chasing obstacles and... Super Mario 64 for the DS gives us more of those than we can honestly handle.  Chasing rabbits is stupid!  The worst part is that there's an extended rabbit grabbing mission both inside and outside the castle when you get close to the end of the game that takes up a good 10 minutes of playtime and it's absolutely terrible.  The bloated floating Mario power-up is kind of cool though.The most unusual and annoying aspect of this game that totally perplexes me is that the levels *still* feel needlessly overlarge.  Nintendo had a ripe opportunity here to fill in all these dreadfully empty and boring areas with tons of goodies to make them feel complete.  I mean why not fill in the empty areas?  Instead Nintendo left these stages the way they are more or less.  They wanted to preserve the game the way most people like it which was of course a bad idea.  Of course the even BIGGER insult is that Nintendo added a few new levels that feel incomplete and outdated just like the regular levels!  Why Nintendo, why?  Why match basic, unfocused blocky-shaped level design with MORE basic, unfocused blocky-shaped level design?  Instead of fixing the outdated-ness of the presentation of the game, Nintendo just throws in a few more simplistically created areas and calls it a day.  Talk about a slap in the face for those of us expecting something more appealing visually.Another really big problem is that in order to grab all 150 stars, we have to go through the same levels AGAIN AND AGAIN!  Talk about repetition at its absolute worse, and going through the same areas over and over will only end up making me want to replay this game even less.  And by less I of course mean never again.  Knowing that the game is STILL intentionally made to force gamers go through the same areas yet again just to obtain another golden star is really pathetic.  Create Mario games either the Super Mario Bros. 3 way where you only have to go through a stage one time before moving on, or the Yoshi's Island way where if you successfully collect everything your first time and 100% a level, you won't have to return to the same stages anymore.  Don't MAKE us go through areas we already completed time and time again for one simple little golden star where the ""adventure"" getting to it is hardly ever rewarding, challenging or lengthy enough to make an impression anyway.The controls are horrible once again, this time persevering a d-pad instead of a big clunky N64 controller (both ideas fail to work right).  The music is absolutely terrible beyond comprehension.  Having to constantly rearrange camera angles is incredibly outdated and annoying.  Super Mario Galaxy proved that switching camera angles is no longer necessary.  It's WAY too happy which is no doubt deliberate on the part of Nintendo for the entire purpose of rubbing more salt in the wound.  Seriously Nintendo, it's possible to make happy music without the irritating obnoxiousness that only ends up distracting what's clearly already a really lame and outdated game overall.  No need to make the experience even worse with music that makes you want to tear the skin off your body.  An example of quality happy music is the stuff we hear throughout World 1 of Super Mario Bros. 3.  Remember the joyful and innocent music in that game?  The music was tame and never frantically irritating.  In Super Mario 64 DS however, the music's like a hayride from the county fair to the downtown post office that rides on an endless loop in the most annoying way imaginable.  Super Mario Bros. 3 is just one of several examples I could name that shows the way music SHOULD be for a platformer that often times requires concentration to succeed.  At least the remixed soothing water music now with techno-ish beats is decent.  If any other themes have been remixed I can't tell.And we have 30 more stars to collect bringing the total to 150 this time around, which means an extra hour or so to collect everything the game has to offer.  I would mention several other features that drag down this supposed ""classic"" but I already touched upon those subjects in my review for the Nintendo 64 version of Super Mario 64 so there's no need to repeat myself here.  The cuteness factor of certain areas is enough to make me puke though.  I don't mind the occasional childish graphics and objectives, but Super Mario 64 takes the childish aspects to really pathetic depths that feels more intended for babies instead of kids.  Take the penguin race level with the penguins and snowmen for example.  *throws up*  Not something grown men who grew up during the 80's when Mario was fresh, challenging, fast-paced and arcade-like would ever admit to enjoying without blushing.  And what DOES Mario say at the beginning of each level?  ""Let's tickle!""  ""Miss Pickle!"" ""Popsicle!""  There's like a million things he could be saying there.  I was informed he's saying ""Let's a-go"" but I absolutely can't make out those words at all.  I had this same trouble with the N64 version since it's the same exact line lazily copied into this game.Just skip Super Mario 64 DS.  I absolutely loathe this game.  The only reason I gave it another chance is because I thought Nintendo radically changed the game and morphed it into something entirely different by ditching all the old, outdated and tiresome ideas that never worked in the first place and yet only existed in the late 90's because Nintendo was riding the 3D wave and needed something cutting edge on the market.  It's no longer 1996, though.  My how I was wrong on all counts to give this game a second chance on the DS.  The two worst levels have remained which only adds to my anger.  The level where you have to tediously and accurately jump across a series of rotating poles above the water collecting coins, and the rainbow-colored carpet ride which is essentially an auto-scrolling level when you think about it.At least the ghost house is pretty cool.  A piano snapping and chasing me around the room is pretty fun, as is punching enemies and knocking them out for coins.  But uh... coins.  That brings me to another subject and another annoyance.  Absolutely the biggest thing Nintendo should have clearly changed is the ""collect 100 coins for a star"" levels.  This means for several minutes I'm forced to thoroughly explore mediocre levels JUST to obtain enough coins for a star.  A sickening, dreadful, terribly unsatisfying concept if there ever was one.  You'd have to be the most delusional person on the planet to enjoy collecting 100 coins while absorbing these unspectacular levels.  I'm done with this review.  Between gamers believing this game is actually a classic and the little enjoyment I get out of it despite relentlessly giving it more chances, I just can't handle it anymore.",I never should have bothered with this

    Nintendo",1,"I have played TONS of Mario games. I got a Wii for X-mas in 2012, and a 3DS in December 2013. I never had the original DS, but the 3DS can play DS and DSi games. I've heard great reviews for this AND the original N64 game. Super Mario 64 is often said to be the best Mario game ever. I played the N64 version first on the Wii. The game was somewhat fun, but the horrible controls and the terrible movement of Mario & camera angles made it 1-star. I heard this game had new stars & characters, so I got it. Plus, because it was a game released in 2004, (ten yrs. old), the camera angles and graphics would be better than the game on the N64 (1996). I was wrong by a long shot.First, the &#34;New characters&#34; thing is stupid. It's a pain in the butt to have to switch from Yoshi to Mario and back to Yoshi for some stars. The &#34;pick up a Wario hat and you're now Wario!&#34; thing is lame because make one error, and you gotta start the whole level over again. I did not like this new feature at all. It's one area that the horrible N64 version is superior to the terrible DS version.Second, the graphics are a nightmare. The graphics look worse than on an N64! They bother my eyes, and you'll keep dying because you can't see where your going or where the goomba chasing you went! Three seconds later, he hits you and you have to grab a coin to restore it. Easy, right? Wait! I can't tell where the coin is! OK, I'm exaggerating a bit, but not by too much.Third, the controls are very confusing. The &#34;Touch screen&#34; thing is a fail. You have to drag your finger while looking at both screens at the same time!  If you are playing this on the old DS, your other option is the control pad. I never did good with control pads except on the Wii, so they might not be too bad. I'm glad I had a 3DS with the thumb-stick which is OK, I guess. But why &#34;B&#34; to jump? &#34;A&#34; is a much better fit for this! They used &#34;Y&#34; for sprint(good) and &#34;A&#34; for punch(bad). The controls overall are a complete mess that is not necessary.Third, the sound is horrible. That annoying music! Poor sound quality! That stupid sound Mario makes when he punches! These are all in here.Overall, Super Mario 64 DS is on par with Super Mario 64(N64), which both suck. Super Mario 64 is not how 3-D platforming should be done. For the price of 30 US dollars, this is not worth it. Rent it before buying it. It's not worth one cent to me. If you're looking for a 3D Mario game on the go, buy Super Mario 3D Land, with charming graphics, nice music, and good controls & gameplay. If you want a list of Mario games in order, here it is:Best:1. Super Mario Galaxy 2 (Wii)2. Super Paper Mario (Wii)3. Super Mario Galaxy (Wii)4. Super Mario 3D Land (3DS)5. Paper Mario (N64)Worst:1. Super Mario 64/Super Mario 64 DS (N64, DS)2. Super Mario Bros. 2 (NES)3. Super Mario World  (SNES)4. Super Mario Bros. 3  (NES)5. Super Mario Sunshine (GCN)Overall, for this, buy the far superior Super Mario Galaxy 2. This game may be fun at first, but you'll fell yourself exploding with rage due to bad music, bad graphics, bad controls, and the game being simply TOO HARD TO BE FUN. the graphics suck, boring game","Starts out fun, gets TOO hard after 15 stars"

As for me, I am only good enough at the game to complete one of the modes, and what I see just isn't enough to keep me playing to improve.  Four modes - that's what this game has.  The goal is slightly different in each one.  But each one has just two stages - Mario falling, and Yoshi carrying Mario.  And once you take a single hit from an enemy, it's game over and start from the beginning (or midpoint).If you want this kind of stylus gameplay guiding the hero and keeping him safe with the stylus, get Kirby: Canvas Curse for DS.

That means that the microphone level, for example, has you blowing into the microphone over and over, regardless of what the microgame is.The unlockables aren't nearly as good as they were in the first Wario Ware, either. It was really cool to be able to unlock the full version of Dr. Mario. It's not as cool unlocking a metronome, calculator and yo-yo. There are more unlockables, but they're really only worth playing with once.Overall, this game was a big disappointment. Fortunately, Wario Ware: Twisted is coming out for Game Boy Advance next month, and it sounds like it will be much better.",Way Too Easy

    Nintendo",2,"Basically, what we have here is the same game.Seriously. Intelli Sys recycled like 60% of the content from FE1(7 in jpn)? The only ""new"" things here are what you'd already expect in a sequel anyway: a new plot and new character designs.Why would anyone pay full price to play exactly the same game all over again? It boggles the mind. On the pc we have what are called ""expansion packs"". This ""sequel"" does nothing new what the previous game hasn't already done. And the previous one, which I've reviewed, wasn't that impressive either.In short, go ahead and buy this if you liked the first one and want more of the same. If the previous Fire Emblem didn't do much for you however, don't expect anything different.","As a game, Sacred Stones is average. as a sequal, its a joke"

    Nintendo",1,"I really like this game- it can be frustrating at first to figure out how to control a constantly rolling ball, but it's fun and not too difficult to figure out. That said, I had collected medals and moved on several stages when the saved file disappeared. I didn't erase it or save over it- I just turned it on one day and it was gone. Nintendo's return policy for it's own games states that you must have the receipt within 90 days to return -which is ridiculous- why would you keep it? You can't return new games! I think it would be also ridiculous to spend $30 on a used copy on Amazon (or $40 for a new one!!) and have the same glitch happen.

    Nintendo",2,I really wanted to like this game.  It looks gorgeous and the plotline intrigued me right from the start.  Where did it go wrong?  Was it the fact that the puzzles were so obvious that they functioned as merely timekillers?  Was it the fact that most of the touchpad interaction seemed tagged-on and ultimately useless?  Was it that the plot turned out to be predictable and cliched?  Was it that the game was so linear that I couldn't have gotten lost if i tried?Maybe it was all of the above.,Not worth it.

    Nintendo",2,"Sigh.......what can I say about this game Trace Memory? Well,this is not your average DS game. For one, there is absolutelyNO KILLING on your part (which is good). This is a VERY casualgame. This game is meant to be played in your free time, on thetrain to work (in my case), on your break, but DO NOT expect anyaction or draw dropping suspense. This is a casual game.Which is NOT bad. In fact, if you're tired of the games out withall their fancy graphics and complicated physics and high-reflexrequirements, then this game is a breath of fresh air. Really.Now that said: I actually liked this game, sort of. I should sayI didn't pay for it, if I had I would be very angry at mypurchase (like I was with Kingdom Hearts). In this you're a 13year old girl (Ashley) visiting Blood Edward Island  (nice namehuh, that's just to grab you) to see her long lost father. Alongthe way you encounter the ghost of a boy who died on the island57 years ago. She gets a device to help her along the way (savegames and item collecting) that looks exactly like the NintendoDS, called a DTS for Dual Trace System (original, huh?),and uses cards that look exactly like the DS's game cards -called DTS cards (hph!). The thing I didn't like about this gamewere it's expectations. Your lead to believe that the ghost boyis somehow interwoven into the overall plot (more on that later)& that the things you learn about the island and its previousoccupants are relevant. They're not. Trust me.They serve as a side story to distract you from the game itself.Which is rather boring. Because 98% of the game takes place in amansion, that for some reason, unlike other mansions only has 1(one) story (floor). Not only that but the floor plan is juststupid!Allow me to explain.The foyer is the main area where you start out in this mansion(you *actually* start the game by leaving the boat andexploring through the island before getting to the mansion)beyond that are the bedrooms for the two main side-storycharacters, Henry & Leonard Edwards, along with the Butler'sroom. But that's not the stupid part. It begins with the gametaking a cue from Resident Evil and forcing you to go back andforth to each room to find little items to unlock secret doorsand open locked drawers and stuff to find more items. In orderto open the doors to each bedroom Ashley has to find hidden keysstashed in the statue in the foyer (for one bedroom), and thekey to other bedroom is hidden in the Butler's room ????? Allthe while you pick up DTS cards with messages from your Dadwhich turns it into a cruel goose chase:[*]""I know you came to look for me in this room, I can't wait tosee you""[*]And then later ""Hey Ashley! I'm glad you came to this room tofind me, but I'll be waiting for you in another room deeperinside the mansion""[*]Then later, ""Hi Ashley, I miss you so much (yeah it shows)that's why I'm not in this room but in the lab at very back ofthe mansion. Can't wait to see you!!""What kind of Father has his daughter going from room to room insearch of him on her 13th birthday? Although it seems cute, butit's not, especially since in order for her to get to him shehas to unlock all the secret doors that he locked behind him -whereas said keys are hidden in cryptic puzzles (like reflectivemirrors, music boxes, magic bookcases). Which brings us back tostupid part - why are there so many locked secret doors withstrange locks involving little drummers, books, and turn of thecentury technology?Why would anybody build a mansion like this? Why build one whereHenry's daughter's room is hidden behind a secret door behind abookcase in the piano room??? This secret bookcase door turnsinto a hallway where the Frannie's room is located is also whereone gets to an artist studio, and other rooms - but wait at theend THIS hall way is a strange curvature that looks like adoorway with candelabras on each side, which, guess what: opensanother secret doorway. What's behind this hidden doorway: thedining room! Why is the dining room hidden behind a doorway?Beyond this is another hallway with access to the kitchen,library and more rooms with secrets.So you're probably asking what's this game about and what doesthe ghost boy have to with it: nothing. In fact, the Ghost Boy'sstory has nothing to do with the plot at all, it's just adistraction. In fact, this distraction is woven into the gameplay. Because as you progress through this ""mansion"" you uncovertidbits about the Edward's family; historical information thatyou are forced to pay attention to because at end of eachchapter there is a quiz which asks questions related to theEdward's family history which has nothing to do with Ashley andher Father. But you are lead to believe that uncovering theEdward's family secrets will uncover the secrets to the GhostBoy's death - but guess what? I finished the game and NO!!Ghost Boy finds out his name is Daniel and that Leonard was hisfather. During the Ghost Boy side story you pick up one of hisshoes in a cellar hidden the liberty, and later towards the endof the game you find his other shoe in the cave. Are you givenany explanation as to what this means: NO! Daniel the Ghost Boydoesn't get his memory back and you are left just wondering whyeven have this secondary character was in the game at all whenthe game could have done fine without him. Sad, since his storyseems to be the most interesting, except having to read all theletters and notes left by his grandfather.The game does make use of every possible DS interactive feature.But don't think you'll figure them out yourself. Here's a hintfor you: GameFAQS. Yeah, without that treasure you will NOTsolve at least three of the puzzles. One involved closing the DS- good luck figuring that out on your own. The other involvesblowing on the mic, and others have a lot of scratching on thetouch screen - better have screen protectors in place.While this game is good for the VERY casual gamer, unfortunatelyit doesn't offer much in the way of game play and the story hasso many possibilities, but falls do short of being intriguing,especially since there is no action or killing. The last Chapterby the way:  Gives a very NEW defintion to ANTI-CLIMATIC!IMPORTANT - if you want to save in Chap-- oh wait , yeah,the game has only 6 Chapters. While it took me 10 hrs3mins to play (I had to close the DS and it in sleep mode whileat work, but the game clock kept ticking anyway, so the extra 4hours don't count) the game can be beaten with about 1 hour ofplaying time per Chapter - not very long. However, you can playit again to get different DTS card messages and a code at theend of the game. I didn't play it again, I just read about the2nd play-through in a FAQ. I had no interest in playing thisgame twice one was enough.Back to the Chapter 6 thing: if you don't save now you willNOT be able to. So, after the Chapter 6 title, go backinto the Trace lab and walk up to the Trace Chair and click it -you can now access the menu to save the game. Why? Because thelast chapter is.....not playable. You just click thorough abunch of dialog. Hint :turn off the music early on as it theMOST uninspired music ever. During the last Chapter there's aVERY tense scene between the characters but the music is softand flaccid. This game is indeed for casualers who needsomething to during a long train or plane trips. But if wantaction and in depth story look elsewhere. Trace Memory will notbe memorable for anyone, except for how dull it was (dependingon your pint if view).Sent via BlackBerry from T-Mobile Paul J.

I search each map extensvely and sometimes there is just nothing there at all, why bother having huge area with nothing in it.  The music gets very tedious after awhile; everytime an enemy approaches you get the same annoying music. I expected a graphical and musical extravaganza, but received mediocre graphics and sound.

The game looks good, sounds good and is big and adventurous -- nearly everything a Zelda player is lookiing for, but, not on GC.First they lied and said the delay was because of tweaks to the game, no, it was because they wanted to release the Wii version with the Wii system and not have people playing the GC version a year earlier.The control on the GC version is substandard after Windwaker and even the updated N64 games are more fluid. It's obvious this was ment to be played on Wii.Also, the graphics are only 4:3 aspect ratio. The [...] go so far as to give you a screen with 3 squares so to calibrate your TV, so if you have a widescreen you set it to make the game a little square in the middle of your big set.There is no excuse for the GC version not the have a 16:9 widescreen alternative, except, they want you to buy the Wii.

    Nintendo",2,"This is a joke, right? The dozens of 5-star reviews have got to be from people in some weird club that gives glowing reviews to boring games for the sole purpose of annoying people. Look, I'm not some anti-Nintendo person; in fact, Nintendo is my favorite developer. And I'm giving this 2 stars overall because the technology is amazing. But this game is no fun, and here are my reasons why.First off: Nothing to do! How can one reviewer say that he/she was ""playing it nonstop"" when your options are exhausted within minutes!? Hasn't Nintendo seen the excellent ""Petz"" series by P.F. Magic, where there are literally hundreds of places, toys, breeds and outfits? Here, all you can do is take walks, enter contests, teach tricks, and buy things (I'll talk about these more later).My second complaint: Extremely aggravating voice control. Look, the voice recognition is really cool. The dogs really recognize individual voices. The problem? Well, after you teach your dog a trick, it will only respond after that if you say the command in the EXACT same way. Therefore, I found myself saying ""sit"" over and over in different ways, trying to find the ""right"" way. How is this fun!? The game should allow for you to vary the way you say the command at least a little bit!Third: The game takes far too long to ""open up"". Let's say I want to buy my dog some cool toys. Oh wait, not enough money! Hmmm, how about entering a contest to earn some cash? Nope, my dog's not well-trained enough! Well then, I'll take it to the gym to train it. Oops, not enough stamina to get to the gym and back! So what CAN I do? Play with the 3 toys I have available, wrestle with the painful trick-teaching system, or watch my dog wander around my empty house. What a joy.Number four: Not enough tangible effects. The only things that are tracked on your puppy's ""stat screen"" are hunger, thirst and cleanliness. Playing with it does not make it happier; there are no stats, such as speed, strength, intelligence, or even appearance, that you can raise. So basically, nothing I did had any impact on the game. What's the point in throwing a tennis ball over and over if your dog seems to forget about it the minute you stop? Beats me.This game is aggravating, boring, and a good concept wasted. The dogs are cute and the technology promising, which earns this 2 stars overall, but there is no entertainment. The only imaginable use for this is to show little kids who beg for pets how boring it really is.",Sit. Sit. Sit. Sit. Sit.

    Nintendo",2,"After playing through half of the single player mode and obtaining a Rank 3/5  on the online component of the game, I have decided to warn everybody about this game.#1. The single player mode is BORING.  It is REPETITIVE.#2. The bosses are RECYCLED. Hooray for fighting the same boss 3 times with another cheap gimmick added in to make it more difficult.#3. Weapons: they are TERRIBLE.  To be blunt, there are THREE useful weapons in the game (Imperialist, Missiles, and that freeze gun).#4. Out of most of the people I play online, I gathered some data of different players and found that approximately 67/104 players (~65%) would rather chase people around in their alt-form (morph ball, etc.) rather than have a firefight.#5. Balance: the other weapons (with the exception of the 3 weapons I mentioned above) are peashooters compared to those three.  I will explain this is detail later.#6. Glitches: I have counted over 20 different glitches that can be used to give an unfair advantage of the glitcher.  For example you can fire a missile at the floor and launch yourself through a wall.  From there, you can safely 1-shot everybody without having to worry about getting hit by gunfire because they cant hit you when you are behind a wall.#7. Matchmaking: Frequently I find myself being matched with rank 5s (highest rank), which basically means good game for you (loss).  You are either matched with a) completely new players or b) top ranked players.#8. Communication: The 'friend-code' system is completely unnecessary, and not being able to do anything but a 4 player Free-For-All on Wi-Fi just gets plain repetitive.#9. Exploiting: Using the freezing gun I mentioned earlier (forget the name), and the hunter 'Noxus,' you can use his affinity weapon to freeze people who are nowhere near you, and three shot them with the freeze gun to their head.#10. Levels: There are 3 levels that are nearly identical to 3 other levels, but just have an extra room or have the weapons relocated for further frustration.#11. Hunters: Two of the hunters COMPLETELY SUCK.#12. No variety. I have once gotten into 3 separate games in-a-row that everyone picked the trigger-happy hunter, Trace.#13. Level Design: absolutely HORRIBLE.  Levels like Head Shot or Weapons Complex just make me want to drill a hole in my game.  It's almost as if Nintendo never thought of designing levels SPECIFICALLY for capture or survival.In conclusion: I find this game extremely frustrating, and nowhere near rewarding for completing goals within the game.  If Nintendo had thought more and looked at other FPS games for inspiration and ideas, I think this game would have been five times better.

    Nintendo",1,"Okay, PLEEEEEAAAASE don't get me wrong people... go ahead and check out this game, heck, i'm sure its worth it. Well, I've lost allot of faith in games anymore... metroid prime hunters... what can I say? Its typical anymore--loss of imagination. People who make games... they do it for the money, and lose heart in the making itself anymore. I AM A HUGE METROID FAN!!!!!!! HUGELY OBSESSED!!!! But, i'm just not feeling into the game spirit anymore. The action wasn't there... compared to zero mission and fusion, i just didn't get the feel. Metroid prime for the game cube gave me the same pessimestic, but true to heart feeling. Maybe its because i'm too use to classics... or that i can only play games as side-scrollers... games like this anyways. I honestly don't know what to say to tell you the truth. I know there are allot of people who love this game--and games like it. I just feel things have gotten a bit too different anymore. I didn't like how this game looked cartoony. The other hunters did anyways. Sure, the graphics were outstanding, but there was just something missing I didn't know what. Okay, i'm just trashing this game... that's not what i'm trying to do though. Like i said, I love metroid!! Just not this one, or any of the newer ones out there. The fun of it stopped at Metroid Zero Mission. Fusion was cool. Super Metroid was the bomb! Hunters? Corruption? Prime? Echoes? I just got bored. And now, here's hunters, i played it, and got the same feeling. But I'm going to keep the game just because its metroid and I like metroid, and I don't ever want to change the fact that every game system I have ABSOLUTELY HAS TO HAVE A METROID GAME IN IT! So, i still make an acception. I just hope that Samus returns to  side-scrolling and this third-person stuff ends. Or! Both... both would be fine too. Because people who like her in side-scrollers can enjoy her there, meanwhile the third-person fans can enjoy her as, well, in third-person. It wasn't a horrible experience though, Michel Jackson's moonwalker was. No game could ever be that bad EVER!Okay okay, its just how i look at it sure. The monsters were more vicious sounding in the older games, looked more nastier, meaner, full of hate; prime, they looked like shiny forms of graphics. Computer-generated animation. Well, OF COURSE!!! ITS JUST SO DARN NOTICEABLE THOUGH!!!! That's it! That's what bugs me, older games and even the ones on game boy advance were animated for a ""COMIC BOOK"" feel. With that, I was actually hooked. That's what I miss, that old comic book feeling while I visualize the game itself as A SIDE-SCROLLER!!!! Metroid Fusion had it. Hunters doesn't. Well, people will argue with me, I'm just waiting for the comments. Not welcomingly, but i know there coming. Hard core fans of hunters would definitely bark at me for this one.

    Nintendo",1,"From personal experience, this is an awful game. But, I'm aware a large number of people gave it Five Stars, so I'm forced to conclude that they either have some type of superhuman ability to cope with the funky controls, or they're masochists.I waited literally years to play this game. The promotional videos looked incredible, and the prospect of encountering, and controlling, other Bounty Hunters was enough to make my mouth water. I bought the very first Metroid Prime back for the Game Cube, a game which was hard, but GOOD.  Metroid Prime: Hunters might have been good, if they had bothered to release it for the Wii, a console which is several orders of magnitude more suitable for this style of game.The controls kill this game. A game should be difficult because of the challenge inherent within the game, not because of the challenge of using the controls. It has four control schemes that I am aware of, and none of them worked for me. Two of them are Left-Handed. It boggles my mind why they didn't design one of the control schemes to switch the Fire and Jump functions. Tapping to Fire just seems much more practical than tapping to jump, albeit at the cost of rapid fire, but they really should have taken all the limitations of the DS into account before they put this game into production. What's worse, they removed the lock-on feature, which is present in every single other Metroid Prime game I have played. Did they honestly think the touch screen aiming was enough to offset the loss? This leaves me to decide between two control schemes, one where Aiming is slow and fickle, and the other where I move like I have an inner ear infection. Plain and simply put, there was no way of establishing a reasonable facsimile of the Metroid Prime controls on the DS handheld, and it should not have been attempted on any game they wanted to actually Sell.I'll confess, I only made it to the second boss, and it was only because the game itself seems to realize how awkward its control scheme is. The first boss was very forgiving, and I managed to defeat him with mostly just determination and patience. The second boss, however, slowly whittled down my HP with a near constant sweep of lasers. I tried Fickle-Aim control the first few times, and couldn't deal damage fast enough to wipe out the boss. I then used Inner-Ear-Infection, and did a little better damage, but had trouble dodging the lasers. Mind you, these are SLOW lasers.  Dying to them was humiliating, but couldn't be helped.This is a game that really should have been the first Wii tie-in to the the Metroid Prime series. Nintendo has a weird habit of incorporating whatever new gimmick their latest system advertises, regardless of whether or not it works for the title or the game mechanics.  But, the Wii's manual point and shoot is a far more intuitive approach to First Person Shooters, and I'm surprised it's not implemented more frequently.Maybe you'd be fine if you had the manual dexterity of a neurosurgeon and the reflexes of a fighter pilot, but us normal human beings have to rely on the patience of a Saint and the Tenacity of a Badger. the graphics suck, boring game",I wanted to like this game

    Nintendo",1,"This is one of those few, rare games that I completely regret buying.First of all, the game doesn't really feel like a metroid game.The single player game doesn't really have much excitement or exploration.  You go forward, you kill the same handful of enemies (sometimes with a different color) and you move on.  Most 2x4's have a more stimulating plotline than this game.It's pretty obvious that the multiplayer is (supposed to be) where it's at in this game.  Unfortunately, it's fairly unrobust.  You get to choose between a wide variety of different Hunters, and by wide variety I mean about 3 that are worthwhile.  The maps are shoddy and poorly designed and with little variety between them.Now, all of that might be forgiveable if the game was at least fun to play.  Unfortunately, this game has what could possibly be thought of as the worst control scheme ever invented by a man.  You use the stylus similar to how you might use a mouse in a traditional PC FPS.  Unfortunately, you've got about an inch and a half area on the screen to move the stylus before you start bumping into other buttons and randomly changing weapons/switching into alternate form.  I have yet to discover a way of handling this game that doesn't result in wrist or finger pain after about 30 minutes of use, but fortunately I rarely play that long before I turn it off in disgust.I can't really think of very many merits this game has.  Its boring, poorly designed, unbalanced for multiplayer (and has a number of level design glitches as well).  It's unfun to downright painful to play.

I love the fact that there are many more species of life in the DS version, namely the saltwater fish.  I caught a shark yesterday and it was too cool!  I do see where the GC version is better than it's DS counterpart but that's no real biggie b/c it's still a blast for item collectors.  There are once again so many things to collect and catch and such.  The one thing in this game that really ticked me off is that I found out that I cannot get Tom Nook's Nookington's with the barber shop in it due to the fact that I am not connected with wi-fi and such and I only have one DS as well.  I also only have a dial-up connection in my home.  So it appears that the main store with the barber shop is off-limits for my wife and I.  That is really really so irritating to me.  Hence the 2 star overall rating. To me this was unforgiveable since the GC version I had no trouble getting the department store all by myself with my one copy of AC.  Nintendo should have thrown in another way to get Nookington's for those like me out there in the gaming world.

When you start back up, you have to listen to this long in-game lecture about how you're supposed to save at your house first, so that you don't undue anything that might have happened in the course of playing. I can see the logic in that, since it involves online play, but still, it's annoying. I don't need scolded by my own game.Then there's the online play. Online play is just about the only way to make this game interesting. It allows you to connect with other players and visit their towns, ect. But the problem is, you can't go online unless you already know someone's 'friend code.' And how exactly can you find out someone's friend code, if you can't go online an meet them? No one else I know owns this game (which says something in itself,) so I guess I'm out of luck.This game is going in my 'resell' pile, that's all there is to it. Maybe other Animal Crossing games are better.","Boring, unless..."

    Nintendo",1,"I loved the game when I was 10 years old. Then I loaned it to my autistic brother (8 yrs old), and it seemed like a good idea.I thought that making freinds with animals could really help his social skills, and he really liked the Wii version. However, hedid not know how to save on my DSi so he just cut it off. Every time you ""reset"" the game, a mole named Resetti comes outto lecture you. I never really cared much about what he made ME do, but he made my AUTISTIC brother type in""I am a loser.""! His therapy instructor is currently working to teach him not to say things like that, and then one of Nintendo'sstupid characters forced him to type negative stuff in! This game could have been a major step for him and me, but now I'm getting my copy back.And here is what I thought of the game:If you decide to purchase this for a more self-confident child or yourself, this is the worst installment of the Animal Crossing franchise. The whole point of Animal Crossing on the Gamecube was for your family to interact together in a virtual town, which can be pretty neat. That dosen't work out on the DS because it is a personal system, the Gamecube was a family system. Nintendo also tried using wireless connections for multiplayer, but that does not work out either. ""Local"" play makes me wonder what Nintendo thought about how many DS systems each family was going to have. Even that is not the social level the Gamecube / Wii provided. Then Wifi, the same thing as local play only over the internet. Friend codes... You work hard to get a friends randomly made number, then you will never know when they are online. Years later you upgrade from a DS lite to a DSi which requires a completly new friend code. Then you upgrade to a 3DS 6 months later... new code, your friends DS lite breaks, new code for him! Of course if you are really desperate you can always share a game card with your family, but then you have to share a house! In the Gamecube version they gave you a little square with 4 houses... one for each player. In the Wii version they spread the 4 houses across the town so you don't have to look at your sister's ugly roof! But on a Nintendo DS, you share a house. My brother and I barley get along in City Folk on the Wii, so we really can't get along in 1 house! Our houses in the Wii look completly different! My brother enjoyed putting fish (because he loves fish) in his house with a nice gentle song playing. My house is filled with 8-bit mario pieces (because I love Mario) and gold sofas with a rock tune playing. It would be kind of hard to combine fish with a bunch of Mario items and have room to spare. If you prefer to play Animal Crossing alone (I don't blame you), you'll have lots of other problems. The animal's AI is really annoying. They walk around, walk some more, and then say the same thing over and over. I was able to talk to Nibbles and then hear Sally say the same thing Nibbles said 5 minutes earlier! It really gets annoying because most of the animals are either jerks or poets. As mentioned earlier, the mean nieghbors were the main reason I stopped letting my brothers play. The rest are pretty much poets. I love poetry, but not in a Nintendo game. One example is that they use big words to describe the weather, when they could say ""I wish it would stop raining"". After having a conversation you heard within the week from somebody else, you would expect your nieghbor to do something else besides use complex metaphors and talk about dieting (FOR CRYING OUTLOUD THIS IS A CHILDREN'S GAME! WHY WOULD A CHILD CARE ABOUT DIET CUSTARD?), but they don't. In the Gamecube version you could do chores for the animals, and they occasionally built igloos and went camping. In this version all that they do on a normal basis is walk around. And forgot NES games, I know that is something that some people bought the game for. No classics in this version though, not even Super Tortimer.Overall, this game is weak compared to the versions on Gamecube and Wii. The mole is an insulting monster who made my Autisic brother type in negative things about himself. The Gamecube Resetti was much more amusing and less severe. The DS Resetti made me want to smash the game when my brother told me what happened. I am a HUGE Animal Crossing fan, but keep newer and younger fans away from this.",The mole IS A JERK TO MY AUTISTIC BROTHER!

    Nintendo",1,"Mario Kart DS has got to be the most overrated game on the DS. It feels like it keeps the classic Mario Kart gameplay, but very downgraded. Most of the tracks you race on (about 90%) are very boring and uninspired. These are probably the worst tracks I've ever seen on Mario Kart. The items aren't that great either, which makes the overall gameplay suck. The graphics really stink, too, they're very blocky, even for 3D DS graphics, but that's not a real problem (I shouldn't make a big deal over graphics). My biggest complaint about this game is its replay value. When I first got Mario Kart DS, I was bored after playing it for about 40 minutes. It's the only Mario Kart I didn't want to play for at least a week. Also, all the extra things in the game (mini-games, or whatever you'd call them) are less entertaining than the already lousy gameplay. Mario Kart DS overall is terrible, but I recommend playing any other Mario Kart game besides this one that you can get your hands on. Every other Mario Kart besides Mario Kart DS is worth buying. I would rate Mario Kart DS only 35 out of 100 points, due to its poor-quality gameplay, replay value, and graphics.","Incredibly Overrated, the Worst Mario Kart"

    Nintendo",2,"First of all, let me preface this review by saying that I have never been a fan of the Mario Kart series. But back in early December (2005), I bought a Nintendo DS and didn't have any games to play on it. I had subscribed to Gamefly so I could start renting them, but wanted something to play until the games from my Gamefly subscription started rolling in. Even though I'd never been into Mario Kart, I kept seeing rave reviews for this game and people were going nuts over it, so I figured why not? Maybe this game was somehow better than the MK games that came before it. And even though Mario Kart DS apparently combines the best aspects of the versions that came before it, at the end of the day, it's still Mario Kart.My biggest problem with this game is its sense of speed ... basically, there is none. If you're used to playing racers like F-Zero and Burnout, this thing moves at a snail's pace.  I heard that it speeds up once you unlock more cars, but you have to plod through a bunch of races using the crappy cars in order to get to that point, and that's just too much work for me. My next gripe with this game are the weapons. I can deal with the banana and green shell, but some of the weapons (*cough* lightening *cough* blue shell *cough*) are just cheap ... these are the kinds of weapons that you have no chance of avoiding. You'll be in first place and get nailed by a weapon that you had *no chance* of dodging, and suddenly you findyourself in 4th or 5th. This makes the entire game tedious and annoying to play. Another gripe in this game is the audio. Nintendo seems to have a knack for including the *worst* music possible in a video game. I'll be glad when portable gaming progresses to the point where custom soundtracks become possible, because the music in games like this just makes me want to turn the volume all the way down.So what about the WiFi feature? Well, I don't have a wireless router, so I went to my local McDonalds hotspot to check it out. The setup was extremely easy and I was playing online in less than 2 minutes after starting the game. However, playing against other humans seemed pretty much like playing against the computer, cept that the humans were a lot better. I think I came in last every time. The service itself is great ... it's just too bad they kicked it off with such a shoddy game.In the end, I just don't understand the draw to this game. To me, it seems like a pretty lame racer with cheap weapons and cartoon characters. I'm still waiting for a DS port of F-Zero. F-Zero is not the be-all/end-all of racing games, but it would certainly be better than this.",I don't understand the appeal ...

    Nintendo",1,"Fire Emblem is too hyped. I've played other Tactics games but Fire Emblem is the worst of the crop. Don't know why people think that a game that you can lose you character at anytime of the game forever is fun. There is no levelling up that you can control in the game, you have to go with the story flow but your enemies outgrow you in immense pace so your character will be eliminated in no time and having that annoying face showing up on the screen telling you he / she is dead. Even when you character levelled up , the stats is so random that sometimes he / she just levelled up but with no improvement in stats at all. Since most of the time they only level up inside the game, if their stats don't go up, tough, they are doomed on the battle field. The number of enemies you usually have out grow you so much that they can basically kill your characters in one or two hits. If you don't want to lose your character, time to reset and do the battle all over again. I have no idea why people find this kind of game fun and challenging. Disgaea and FF Tactics are fun because you grow with the characters. They can die but you can revive them so you won't be losing your hard work. But in Fire Emblem dying forever is just as easy as drinking water. That sucks man.Also I could not believe that even up to now, Nintendo is still forcing people to read all the long winding dialogue instead of having actual cut scenes. The limited cut scenes in the game are pretty budget in terms of graphics.I personally think Fire Emblem doesn't deserve the fame and hype around the franchise.

    Nintendo",1,"If you collect Gameboys, this is the perfect thing for you.  However, if you just like playing the games, I honestly must say for you to pass this up.  For reasons that are pretty obvious.For one, everything GOOD about the Gameboy Micro, can easily be seen in the GBA SP.  This screen is backlit and easily fits in your pocket, and plays GBA games.  Alright, that's fair enough.  But come on?  The GBA SP was just like that.  With the GBA SP there was a backlight with a rechargable battery, and if you folded it down then it went into your pocket with no problems at all.  I do like all the different custom face plates though.  They're easy to use and don't leave any of that sticky residue.The GBA Micro is, of course, for those who do not already have a GBA of any kind.  If you don't have a GBA, go with the SP.  And let me explain why:1. You cannot protect the screen of your GBA micro: If you stick it in your pocket, you'll pull it out only to see several scratches on the screen.  Needless to say this is a big problem.  With the SP's fold down LCD Screen, you could easily protect it.2. The Screen is Actually Smaller: This is true too.  The screen is smaller and the games are not properly brought down to scale.  It's very annoying!3. You can't play older Gameboy games and Gameboy color games: The same thing plagued the DS, but the DS I could live with.  This I cannot.  Part of the reason I still have my GBA SP is so I can play older Gameboy games.  You can't do that with the Micro.4. The list price is too high: I don't know about you, but I certainly don't want to spend one hundred bucks on this when the SP has more to offer in terms of quality.  The SP is cheaper and easier to work with.  With the hand-held console war advanced off to the PSP and DS, paying one-hundred dollars for this is almost shady.Overall: If you are someone looking for a decent Gameboy system, get the SP.  You get all the qualities of the Micro and more.",This is NOT worth it

    Nintendo",2,"This game is entertaining enough. However, it doesn't have the best playback value and gets old pretty quickly. First of all, I don't like the new graphic style of the game. When I turned it on the first thing I thought of was Dexter's Laboratory. It has a very cartoonish (American-style cartoon) look to it and doesn't feel like a Pokemon game at all. Second, what's with that story? You play as some girl who is a secret agent out to get people who are trying to steal Pokemon...probably the dumbest thing Pokemon has done since...well since forever. Since when does the world of Pokemon have secret agents? It just doesn't seem to go well.The gameplay is pretty fun. I love puzzle games, and this one is challenging and it makes you think. You control rows and colums of Pokemon that fall from the top of the screen one by one (entire rows don't fall at once, Pokemon do) and try to match them up. This is a lot like Tetris Attack in some respects, except you move the entire row or column instead of switching individual places. You have to try to clear the screen of all Pokemon. You control the Pokemon from the touch screen, but the top screen is also part of the level. If the top screen fills all the way up, you lose. Dittos are wild, and there are rare Pokemon that only appear in the levels every so often, some of which disappear quickly if you don't combo them right away. Since you have a Pokedex, the rare ones go into that collection.I'm not really a fan of the new-school Pokemon - I liked it better when there were 151 of them and they were more creative (come on, what the heck is PINECO??). That gives me a bias against the new games to begin with. However, as a puzzle game this game is really not all that creative. It's fun for a few days and then it gets boring. You fight different ""Bosses"" and collect Pokemon for your Pokedex. It's fun, but this is nothing new.

    Nintendo",1,"Firstly, the interface is a bit flawed. On many many occaisions I would say the correct answer (the Nintendo DS/DS Lite has a mic that this game uses), and it wouldn't register my answer being correct even though I was speaking the correct term. So, actually I was correct but the game thought I was wrong and gave me a poor rating. This can be very frustrating and seems unfair when it displays the color Blue for example, and you clearly say ""blue"" and it doesn't even register.Secondly, it relies on how fast you can write with the stylus. A lot of people may be very quick to think the correct answer, but may not be that good writing on the screen with the stylus, which can be awkward since to play this game, you have to hold the DS or DS Lite turned on it's side like an open book. It will give you a bad score just based on this, even though you knew the answer.Thirdly, the sayings that are on the screen during game play are strange and condescending. I think they are supposed to make the doctor virtual character seem powerful and superior, but really a lot of what he says doesn't make much sense. There is no way to turn this off, which can be a bit annoying because you have to sit through or click throw his sayings each time you play.This game should not rely so much on stylus and voice input and it should be redesigned to use the buttons more. As it is designed, the buttons are virtually never even pressed!The game is more frustrating than fun not because I can't answer the exercises quickly and correctly most of the time, but because the game doesn't recongize my correct input as correct the majority of the time. What good is that?The premis of the game is empty-it's supposed to exercise your brain but in reality, playing Super Mario Brothers (or any other game) probably exercises your brain just as much and is a whole lot more fun.I give it a thumbs down. the graphics suck, boring game","Flawed implementation, problematic"

    Nintendo",1,"This game pales in comparison with the Sudoku found in Brain Age. The only reason to play it on the DS instead of in a cheap paper book are the electronic features. But if the interface is awful, why bother?PROS:The only nice feature this offers over pen and paper Sudoku are 2 minimal improvements: Double clicking on a number will highlight all instances of that number on the grid. And when a number appears 9 times already on the grid (not including the jotted notes) then that number fades out and you can't input it anymore. Ready for the bad parts? Keep reading....CONS:The interface! Here are the things I hate about it:1. The total grid takes up about 1/2 of 1 Nintendo DS screen. The upper screen mirrors the grid on the lower screen... and at the same size. There is absolutely no function for the upper screen. All it really offers is a timer. Too bad you can't turn it off to save power.2. The temporary numbers you use to indicate possible numbers is tiny. I'd say a 4 point font. If you're over 40 years old... save your eyesight. Now imagine that font with a dim screen (since you're using an old DS model or saving power since the upper screen is sucking it all away) ... and imagine it while moving (like in a subway or car).3. The tiny temporary numbers don't disappear when you indicate the actual number you think fits in that cell. Each cell holds up to 4 temporary numbers. So you'll have to click on the tiny corners of the cell and manually delete them.4. No option to be alerted if you enter the wrong number in a cell. (Brain Age has this option).5. Lousy music. Guess this is a plus too since turning off the speaker saves battery power.6. More bad interface.... This happened to me one time: I was resuming a saved game and made a mistake when I filled in the puzzle. I wanted to go back to where I last saved.... it's not possible except by restarting the DS. I chose to return to the main menu, hoping I could do it from there. And guess what? It didn't just delete my unsaved information but it tossed out my save too.",You're considering the wrong game!

The grid navigation and number entry system are very intuitive. The only issue is there are a set number of puzzles.I wish the designers of Brain Age would put out a dedicated sudoku game with the same interface, but one that generates new puzzles.I'd stay away from Gridmaster.

    Nintendo",2,"My wife will swear that Sudoku is fun, but coming from a background of more epic stuff Mario and Zelda, you can understand why I don't see her point. True enough, Sudoku has its fair share of supporters, but whether it warrants a video game on its own remains questionable. That, however, doesn't stop the tons of Sudoku-related games on handheld consoles over the past few months. The likes of Go! Sudoku and Dr. Sudoku have made their rounds on the PSP and GBA respectively, and even the immensely popular Brain Age has a section devoted entirely to the game itself. Sudoku Gridmaster, released as a budget title, is the latest kid on the block.As the core gameplay of Sudoku never changes, the things that separate Sudoku Gridmaster and other Sudoku video games are therefore purely cosmetic. You won't find any groundbreaking graphical presentation here, but at least the game tries to reduce the blandness by offering a small variety of backgrounds for the player to choose from. The soundtracks are also changeable, even though they tend to be rather distracting when the going gets tough. And trust me, the puzzles in Sudoku Gridmaster are tough. The game offers over 400 Sudoku puzzles spanning four difficulty levels, and the higher level ones may stump even the most seasoned player. If you go into the game expecting to breeze through the levels, be warned.The game allows two modes of input. The first is the direct writing method, which is popularized by Brain Age. In fact, this method of input is very similar to Brain Age's. The player basically touches a square, and writes the answer on it. Unfortunately, the usual recognition issue does surface here though. For example, the game doesn't quite recognise my ""7"" properly, and treats it as a ""3"" instead. This is why a second method of input is included, I guess. This approach allows the player to choose a square, and then choose a number to be keyed into it. This will suit players who have problems getting their handwriting to work on the touch screen, but it's somehow less fluid as compared to just writing the numbers in.Regardless of which method you choose, you will play each puzzle with a timer. You'll then be ranked according to how well you do. There's also an option to save and exit a puzzle at anytime, allowing you to return later to have a go again from the saved point. This is perfect for a handheld, since you'd expect plenty of on-the-run play.For all its efforts to make Sudoku more fun than your usual pen and paper game, Sudoku Gridmaster has a fundamental flaw. A player can easily cheat by stopping the game, sorting out the puzzle on the top screen, and then resuming and keying in the answers on the touch screen without sacrificing in-game time. Although this defeats the purpose altogether, the fact that a ""feature"" like this exists may just be tempting enough for players who simply want a high score for every puzzle.The sheer number of puzzles available in Sudoku Gridmaster will satisfy fans of the game. For others, however, the game may be less enjoyable. Backgrounds and soundtracks aside, Sudoku is basically just Sudoku. If solving Sudoku puzzles is all you wanted, stick to pen and paper instead.",Run of the mill

    Nintendo",2,"I haven't played a new Mario game since Super Mario 64, and my experience with that game left me feeling like it was an unexceptional and overrated game, with the biggest complaint being there were simply WAY too many empty areas throughout the game resulting in too much pointless roaming around to do.  Lack of enemies severely hurt Super Mario 64.Well, more than 12 years later, I'm now playing Super Mario Galaxy that I received for Christmas... and uh oh.  The same exact problems I experienced with Super Mario 64 have returned, and in most likelihood, those problems probably never even left in the first place (so I'm definitely not kicking myself for ignoring every new Mario release over the last several years).  It appears like I didn't miss anything special about the Mario series at all the last 10 years.  Unless utter disappointment and frustration qualifies as special?  Didn't think so.The number one biggest complaint with Super Mario Galaxy is that it's VERY hard to control Mario's movements.  You think I'm terrible at video games?  Guess again- I've been playing video games for over 20 years and learned to deal with a variety of different movements, many of which were *really* downright confusing and discouraging (such as a fair share from the NES console for example) but nothing has EVER given me as much frustration as this game has.First of all, Mario doesn't move with *nearly* as much speed as he did in the older Mario games, and in fact, there's not even a run button.  Why is this?  I have no earthly idea.  When you take away the speed, you inadvertently take away the crucial element of ""fun"".  Simple as that.Furthermore, a lot of times the camera pans out so you can barely even SEE where Mario is going, or what Mario is even doing!  This results in a *lot* of unfair, cheap and untimely deaths.  It's ridiculous that I keep falling over the edge (and into that huge orange/black spinning black hole of instant death that constantly lurks below) simply because I can't see what Mario is doing.Oh, and no- it's NOT my television screen either.  It's perfectly fine.  My eyes are fine too.  The fact that Mario's movements are so slow and stiff also contributes to many unnecessary deaths.  This is NOT why I fell in love with the Mario series back when I had an NES and Super NES either.  Had Super Galaxy been my first exposure to the series, I would have thrown the game in the trash after giving it 5 solid hours of my precious time.I wish the movements were as precise and fluid as the ones found in the Spyro the Dragon series, specifically the *original* Spyro the Dragon series that appeared on the Playstation One console.  That particular series did 3D movements perfectly, not to mention it was a heck of a lot more fun running around collecting gems, completing mini games, interacting with many unique characters, and checking out more interesting/creative environments than the ones included here.Certain objectives later on in Super Mario Galaxy require *exact* movements in order to complete, and if you're off just a tad, you will fall to your death over and *over* again.  It's quite annoying, and to be completely honest -despite what people think- even the hardest of the old-school 2D Mario games such as Lost Levels and Yoshi's Island were significantly less frustrating than this.  At least I knew what I did wrong when I died in the older games, and learned from it next time.  There's no learning here- you either land safely or you don't.  Not much in the way of a learning curve.Oh, and those levels where you're positioned on top of a huge clear rolling ball and forced to use the Wii remote to steer it around correctly are, in my opinion, the biggest annoyance I've EVER had to deal with in a video game.Overall, do NOT buy this game for your kids-  Super Mario Galaxy was designed in a way that requires gaming skills of near perfection.  If you don't have the patience to perfect your skills, surprise surprise- this game will have you throwing your Wii remote/Nunchuk at the TV screen countless times.  That's a promise.","Mario in 3D- oh boy, it never gets better"

However there are a lot of extremely irritating levels,that send you plunging to your death, over and over. I don't mind dying fighting something, but falling to my death, after the 20000th time, is just iritating and not fun. This game would easily be a 5 star must have video game, if they would drop the iritating and not fun at all plumet to your death scenes. If you buy this game, you will probably love an awful lot about it, but I do believe there have got to be a lot of people like me, who can only take falling to your death, so many thousand times in a game. After another month of playing, I have to drop my ratings down lower. Somebody ought to tell the makers of this game, that the number one goal is fun. Not nit picky demands on very precise movements, with controllers that are anything but suited to such things. This game could easily be a 5 star game, if not for the countless fall to your deaths, daredevil levels, that are hard and frustrating enough, to make a person hate video games altogether. They could make a difficulty setting for this game, and fix everything. Easy for even a 5 year old. Normal, something that a 12 year old should be able to win eventually, hard, and if they want to they could even add a criminally insane difficulty level, for those who enjoy making no progress, over, and over, and over again.

This game is aimed at a much much much younger audience(Ages 4-10 at the least). Not saying that Mario is an adult game, it has always been a children game, but its difficulty level made it a challenge for everyone. Super Mario Galaxy holds your hand to the very end of the game. The game almost feels like no challenge at all. There is no striving to get that 1up, that special star, or anything really. It's all almost given to you.

In this I was absolutely neither...matter of fact I barely did anything to get there. This game was hardly a challenge at all. Most Mario Games are known for their level of difficulty as Super Mario has never been a breeze to walk through(unless you spent 100hours on it like the Mario pro's). I was dissapointed to see that Nintendo had eased up on the game for the WII release. Of the later Mario games I would say Super Mario 64 was probably the best. It was difficult, challenging, and you had to really play it to beat it.

    Nintendo",1,"Yes, because Metroid is one of Nintendo's most long-running and successful gaming franchises, Metroid Prime 3 had no choice but to be created and released. But you know, it's certainly nowhere *near* a classic because it's basically a watered down, less interesting sequel but with slightly improved graphics and sweet-looking explosions.  Actually, the explosions aren't necessarily better than the first two Prime games, but I found myself admiring them more this time around (perhaps because I was bored out of my mind in so many other ways).Remember the original Metroid on the NES, Metroid 2: Return of Samus on the Game Boy, and Super Metroid on the Super NES? These games were released a long time ago, and what made them so fantastic was how the gameplay emphasis on each of them was on ""exploration"".In Metroid Prime 3, you predictably go through one hallway after another shooting whatever you see. While it's somewhat fun, the lack of exploring hurts the game a LOT and prevents it from having much in the way of replay value. I also hate how it takes such a long time to defeat some of the bosses in the game. It was never like that in the past (playing the 2D Metroid games, I mean).  Are you kidding me?  20-30 minutes to completely eliminate ONE boss battle?  Why in the heck does it take so darn long???  This complaint holds true with the previous two Prime games as well.  That's a major, unforgiveable problem.Also, and this is a pretty big complaint, the regular enemies you encounter while going through these numerous, one-way hallways are usually small, horribly animated, and just boring to watch/fight.  NOTHING compared to the enemies in the first two Prime games.  We're talking dreadfully boring enemies to the point you sometimes find yourself just preferring to run past them and not waste a single moment fighting them.  I'm extremely disappointed here.  It makes me think the third installment in the series is an obvious milk job by Nintendo.Besides the first hour of the gameplay being extremely tedious and boring because you're doing nothing but talking to soldiers like it's a borderline RPG game, exploring generic computer rooms that we've seen to death in thousands of other video games, and admiring constant blue/grayish colors throughout *every* single wall located on *every* single hallway (yes that's sarcasm) the game eventually changes so you're exploring different areas of land by way of your spaceship.  Too bad each of these lands ends up missing the mark and looking rather dull compared to the previous Metroid Prime games.  Actually it's more like a poor imitation of previous efforts.That's not quite the biggest issue I have with the exploration feature however.  The BIGGEST problem is that the game is nothing more than a lengthy series of miniature and narrow hallways constantly taking you to even MORE miniature and narrow hallways.  You're probably wondering why I keep saying ""narrow"" and it's because, for the most part, the hallways are exceptionally tiny and uninteresting.  It's like so much effort was put into the background graphics (which are overrated by the way- the game doesn't look *that* great) that the development team thought they could get away with slacking off on the level design.  I don't think so- if a game's not fun to play, it's not worth my time.  Basically no matter where your ship goes small hallways will definitely be in store for you.  The areas that are actually fairly beautiful are usually either too short so you never feel obligated to stop and take notice, or appear like an obvious rehash of the places you were already fascinated by in Prime 1 and 2.Ice missiles are a really bad idea.  Yes, you can freeze the lava and make a walkable platform for yourself.  Who cares?  These aren't the kind of improvements that take advantage of the Wii's capabilities.  It's not the kind of improvements to shell out money for either.  Grappling doors and enemies isn't very fun either.  In fact, you might even say it's downright cheap.  While grappling an enemy, most likely another enemy from off-screen will shoot laser balls at Samus and drain a good deal of your health.  Meanwhile you can't do a darn thing about it because you're stuck in the grappling position with the first enemy.  Oh sure, this entire process only takes a few seconds (by either letting go of the grapple or going through with it and removing the enemies shields) but SEVERAL of the space creatures in the game are frantic laser ball-shooting maniacs, so it only take a few seconds to empty good chunks of your life energy.  This means you need total preparation to deal with these tough enemy situations but unfortunately the unfair and relentless nature of their ways makes it a needlessly tough task.Lock onto enemies, fire repeatedly until they die, rinse and repeat.  It's predictable and boring now.  This is exactly what you'll be doing the entire way through.  You'll most likely be doing it while being forced to deal with unavoidable laser ball blasts by the space creatures.  I prefer the 2D games where you actually had to aim and practice your skills to eliminate the bad guys.  With enough practice you'd actually be able to *master* the games.  This is probably not entirely THIS games fault- but 3D games in general.  Ugh, enough is enough.Speaking of the Wii, who's bright idea was it to make the game so you actually have to turn and pull on the Wii remote to do certain commands involving opening doors and whatnot?  Yes, I'm referring to grappling again.  No, you don't have to do these commands for EVERY door you walk through- just specific ones.  It's still a terrible idea and it's more annoying than anything else.Speaking of doors, why in the WORLD does it take 10-15 seconds to load a door?  Are you kidding me?  This game was released in 2007 (not 1996) so it's absolutely pathetic that we have to sit there and wait for the doors to open, especially when this wasn't even a problem in the first two Prime games.  Ridiculous.  Also -while waiting for a door to open up- make sure you've taken care of all the enemies in the room (and I mean ALL of them).  They WILL find a way to sneak back into the picture and blast Samus from behind.  Such a dreadful gameplay flaw.Another enormous gameplay problem are the puzzles that require the gamer to deal with infinitely spawning enemies while trying to accomplish a task.  Many times, after spending more than 20 minutes trying to finish a task and being unable to do so thanks to the enemies being a frequent problem with their recurring ways,  I just shut the game off and say ""I'm done with this BS"".  I strongly dislike the way the puzzles are designed in this game.  I can't tell you how many times I was *almost* finished and an enemy became a distraction and I either couldn't finish the puzzle or died.  Frustration to the highest extent.The one positive is that Hypermode is pretty awesome.  No, it doesn't actually speed up the gameplay (like I originally thought when I first read about it).  Instead, Hypermode is the name of a really powerful laser beam-type weapon that blasts the living heck out of anything that moves.  It's pretty awesome.  However, there's a certain degree of complexity involved in using it properly that's a bit overbearing and therefore annoying.  It's only a slight learning curve admittedly because once you figure it out you'll be fine after that, so I can't complain about it TOO much. I can however, complain about something else- that being, when you immediately enter a room and become overwhelmed by enemies and therefore become corrupted right away, and you have ZERO time to react and therefore you die immediately.  Cheap, uncalled for, and severely flawed.The first three Metroid games ever made for the NES, Game Boy and Super NES were REALLY different from each other and that's another thing that made each of them appealing to gamers everywhere.  Alright, so the first two Metroid games aren't THAT much different (besides the obvious color and graphic differences) but certainly Super Metroid is a drastic step in a significantly different direction.The first three Metroid Prime games however, are all basically the same. It's *really* not like Nintendo to ever milk a series (with the exception of Mario perhaps) but for some reason, they're letting it happen with the Metroid Prime series. It's probably time they stopped working on making Metroid games and focused on another creation, because innovative gaming in the Metroid series is probably now a thing of the past.",not worth your time no matter what anyone says

OK, you can memorize the patterns and the next time it happens you'll be ready for it, except now there is another new pattern you have to figure out. OK, so you memorized this new pattern and now you're ready again, I bet you feel real smart for memorizing the developer's patterns don't you? Are you having fun now? NO! Because this is what developers could do and get away with in the 80s, but it's been two decades of video game growth since then. In the 80s when video games were zygotes, the developer created a pattern which the player had to figure out, once the player figured out the pattern, the dev would make a new pattern, and the player would figure it out and master it again. This method quickly becomes repetitive but when video game technology was in it's infancy and designed to eat up quarters at arcades, the developers could get away with it. But now everyone has a cell phone, the Soviet Union is no more...you know...things change. Today, the developers ask themselves, ""what would be fun for the player, what can we do to make it challenging without loosing its fun, and how do we constantly innovate?""Retro studios fulfills half of that, and then shoots itself in the foot. For every great idea they have, they balance it with a bad idea. I was hooked on this game from the start. You begin in the cockpit of Samus's ship, even though you don't get to fly it, you can manipulate the ship and explore the interior. It's immersive. The puzzles are fun, the controls work well although the menu system is clunky, the combat is fluid and smooth even though the Wii-mote is fidgety, the narrative is just good enough to push the action along, and then you'll get stuck and can't figure out where to go. You'll back track and exhaust all ideas and then look for an online guide and then find out that you have to bomb out an obscure part of a wall to gain access to a tunnel.  Sometimes you'll run around a room and can't figure out where to go and after 20 minutes, you'll realize that there is a muddy looking ledge that is semi hidden in the shadows. The art design is superb, but this game really needs a HD upgrade for better resolution, shadows and textures.Despite all these flaws, it's still fun enough to keep enduring the pain...until you run out places to put a hole in your wall and then you have no wall left to put a hole into and you just can't go on anymore. If you have enough space on your wall, however, you're in for a real treat. This game can rival the best of today's franchise titans such as God of War, Halo, Call of Duty, and Mass Effect.",Dirty old tricks pull down a great game

    Nintendo",1,"I have played video games for over 25 years and have loved every minute.  I have played the past two Metroid games and they were GREAT.  This one....while the Wii bells and whistles make gameplay really cool...the makers just made boss battles and mini-battles completely tedius rather than innovative.  You must hit a specific place at a specific time with a specific weapon consistantly correct for up to 20 minutes at a time or else the boss suddenly regains all past power and health and you must start again from the beginning.  This is the only way they get anything over 20 hours of gameplay out of the thing.  This is a growing trend amoung those creaters that just don't care about much other than getting our money.  We don't really want to add any more rooms to the game so let's just make the normal 10 minute boss battle last 2 hours.....not out of anything new, just out of tedius hit this spot, hit the spot next to it, hit a different spot, oops....half a second late, start again....great game system, great franchise, bad game, bad developers..... the graphics suck, boring game",Tedium is no excuse for longer game play....

    Nintendo",2,"Being a big fan of the original Metroid on the NES, and after reading all the reviews of the game, I had high hopes for this title. Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed. This game could have been great, but the technical issues and poor control scheme and UI made it nearly unplayable, at which point I completely lost interest in the game. I still finished it because I wanted to see what happens, but it felt more like a chore than a game. Overall I give this a 2/5. Read on for details.Graphics--------Samus, the ship, the monsters, the cutscenes and the environments are all beautiful to behold, but the poor lighting and confusing color scheme made it nearly impossible to navigate some areas. Paths around corners were way too easy to miss because the walls all blended into each other. Due to the lack of shading in the graphics engine, I spent way too much time muttering, ""There's supposed to be a path here somewhere"" than actually going from room to room. Nevertheless, despite this shortcoming, the graphics themselves are excellent. I give it a 4/5 for graphics.Music / Sound-------------The music was very well done. It was subtle, and you won't recognize many of the themes, but they added real atmosphere. Like a great movie soundtrack, you don't really notice it while you're there, and only really appreciate it in retrospect. The sound effects were all appropriate, with lovely explosions and beam noises and stereo effects. I find no faults with music nor sound. 5/5.Controls--------This is where the game really starts to fall apart. With the lack of a calibration system, you can't just point your Wiimote at the screen and expect it to aim where you want; you have to be able to see the cursor. Unfortunately, with all that's going on, you can rarely see it, so half the time you have no idea where you're aiming. The Z-targeting, if anything, makes it MORE difficult to aim. When you go to/from the ball, it often shifts your perspective around. This is extremely inconvenient when navigating in tight situations where there's no room for the camera. I never got used to the three different 'helmets' in the game, and I was always going into the wrong helmet for various tasks. I give it points for the space boost and the screw attack control scheme - that part worked pretty well. Overall, though, the controls were frustrating at best. 2/5.Gameplay--------Metroid should be fun. This was not fun. Going from place to place took FOREVER because doors wouldn't open when you want them to (due to a long-standing bug - they have to load the adjacent zone before the door will open). Looking up things in the menu system was incredibly frustrating, and the fetch quest at the end was contrived and pointless. The plot was uninteresting and convoluted, and about half-way through the game I no longer cared why I was performing these tasks - not that I could follow it anyway. The 3D map system is horrible. It's nearly impossible to read and using it is often more confusing than just looking around the room you're in. Between the poor load times, the frustrating control scheme, the monsters that just kept coming back over and over again (didn't I just kill you? what the...), the INCREDIBLY LENGTHY boss battles, and any number of things that robbed the game of any fun-factor it had at the beginning, I can't give this game more than a 1/5 for the gameplay.Replayability-------------Even if this game were replayable, I wouldn't want to. When you finish the game, it does allow you to go back and play it in ""hyper difficulty"" mode, but why would you want to do that? 33 hours of frustration later, and you want to leap back into it? I think not. 1/5.",Huge disappointment - shoddy controls and frustrating gameplay

    Nintendo",2,"I was looking for a good ""racing"" game for the Wii.  All over the web it seems that this one is most highly praised.  This review is for someone looking for a racing game where the vehicles behave even somewhat realistically.  The cover of the box reminded me of 4X4EVO and 4X4EVO2 which are games I played on a PC with steering wheel control about 7 years ago.  I really like those games and was hoping this was similar.This game does allow you to race.....that is true.  It can also be a lot of fun.  The problem is this.  I can't begin to tell you WHAT you are racing.  Maybe if we called it a hovercraft or a jet truck or a spaceship/truck hybrid, it might help.  Any resemblance to the way a real truck, or any real world vehicle for that matter, behaves seems to be out of the question with this game.  The graphics are good and scenery is very realistic.  That is when you can see it.  The trucks move at an impossible pace.  They have turbo boost and when you play against the computer trucks, you will find that if you do not use your turbo boost to the maximum, you will not keep up.  This causes the truck to move at relative speed of what seems to be 150 miles an hour through what is usually woods.  Almost nothing stops the truck as far as terrain or turns in the road.  Trees will stop you.  Trees will ALWAYS stop you.  Any tree you hit will make the truck crash and cause you to wait until you can resume.  Now, on to the flying part.  If you really compete with the computer trucks, you spend anywhere from 30% to 50% of the time in the air.  You can control staying in the air longer or shorter (HHMMMMM what is the physics of that?).  You can STEER in the air???!!!!!  You can land after being 50 yards in the air and just keep on going as though that would not cause any damage, but don't hit that tree....you will stop dead in your tracks.This is definitely a very fun ""jet car/truck flying amphibious hovercraft spaceship"" racing game.  No realism to speak of.",Fun but needs better classification

    Nintendo",2,"OK I admit I'm not a big fan of racing games.  I liked Burnout 2 on the Xbox, but that was mostly because of its crash mode.  How much fun can you have driving in circles over and over again?  Yeah the courses change and there is the competition aspect, but really in the end you are just sitting there holding down the accelerator button and tilting the controller.  There's no real strategy, suspense, or thinking.  Oh and the physics are weak.  Explain to me how a car can turn in mid air with no wheels touching the ground?  This may be fun for parties for about 5 minutes at most.","Decent use of the Wii controller, but gets old fast"

    Nintendo",2,"All these five star reviews seem to completely lack objectivity. Everyone keeps saying it's amazing and is the best Zelda ever. This just isn't true. First of all, amazing compared to what? GTA, Final Fantasy, or Shenmue? The game has midi music, no live voices, average graphics, and an unrealistically small overworld with 1-3 street towns, forests without any trees in your way. Is this ""amazing"" compared to a whole state with three cities composed of dozens of blocs, hundreds of people and vehicles, like in GTA: San Andreas? This game pales in video game standards compared to even Shenmue I, Final Fantasy X, and GTA 3 which came out 5-6 years before it.Futhermore, the game seems to ignore most of the progress the Zelda franchise made since LttP. LttP had 12 dungeons, 4 swords, 3 shields, 20 items, and magic power with lots of spells. TP only has 8.5 dungeons, 2 swords, 2 shields, 12 items, and no magic at all. Ocarina introduced integration of a musical instrument to the gameplay. This element is lacking in TP. Majora's Mask introduced very extensive gameplay before you enter the dungeon, and extensive character interaction and sidequests. All of this is significantly scaled back in TP. Also, whereas in MM, you could transform into three different forms that could hover, roll, or swim rapidly underwater, in TP, you only transform into a wolf that can't do much. Wind Waker introduced an overworld that was realistically large and integrated, meaning it was all one piece--not a bunch of areas with load times between them. TP overworld is smaller than WW's, is fragmented into small areas, and often doesn't match. For example, if you look at Hyrule Castle from the ground, the rooftops you scaled to reach Zelda aren't there. Finally, most Zelda games had a unique feature/ability. MM had masks, Oracle Games had seeds and rings, Minnish Cap had Kinship Stones, etc.  TP has nothing like that.  So how is it that a game that came out years after its predecessors on Nintendo's most powerful console yet actually REGRESSED in amount of equipment, number of dungeons, overworld size, etc.!? LttP made a huge leap over Zelda II, and OoT made a huge leap over LttP. These games were among defining for their time. TP made little progress over N64 games or Wind Waker, and feels a generation behind contemporary games like Final Fantasy XII or GTA: San Andreas.The story is strange, too. You don't really learn anything about the Legend of Zelda/Hyrule. The story is all about Midna and Zant, which is frustrating, since TP was supposed to be the spiritual successor to the OoT. Also, the weird cybernetic twilight world with floating square particles, wormholes, and Zant's castle that looks like inside of a computer REALLY clashes with Zelda's medieval theme. Other than the postman from Majora's Mask, there are no characters from other Zelda games, no fairy fountains, no pissed off chickens, no magic, nothing recognizeable, really.  So it just doesn't have much Zelda charm. WW was a tropic island adventury with cartoony graphics, but with recognizable Zelda elements, a new chapter to the Hyrule legend, and strong interaction between Link, Zelda, and Ganondorf, it felt like a Zelda much more than this one.Also, there is little innovation here.  Other than the horseback combat system, which was awesome, nothing here is really new.  Also, collecting three things, and then collecting five more things is getting pretty old by this point, especially on a 3-D system.  Can't Nintendo come up with a more involving storyline?Finally, this all would have been okay if the game were really fun. But it's not. For the first three dungeons, you discover big new areas, but the action is boring.  As a wolf, you run around deserted black-and-white areas killing bugs.  Human action is a little better, but there's little of it.  Soon after the third dungeon, you don't go back and forth between twilight and light, and you barely play as the wolf.  Also, the action between dungeons becomes shorter and shorter. After fifth dungeon, you don't discover any new places (except one one-street town) and don't do anything except maybe a couple of really tedious fetch quests or repeats of the early quests. The dungeons themselves are okay. Only walking on walls and ceiling in the Goron Mines and the enitre City in the Sky felt above and beyond what we've seen before. Otherwise, they're too strait-forward and the puzzles too simple. Also, the design isn't very crisp and their theme (interaction with fire, water, etc) isn't developed as well as before. The fire dungeon is a weird combination of mechanical mines, caves, and docks, and the water dungeon has only slightly more water in it than the fire dungeon. The Temple of Time is a complete rip off of the Wind Waker's Tower of Gods. The mini-bosses and the bosses in this game are the best of any Zelda games, although too easy, and they still just wait for Link to hit them.So, overall, for me the game was a disappointment. And before people discard my opinion because I don't love the game and write how I must be an Xbox or PS fan or that I haven't actually played this game, know that I don't even own these systems and that I played almost every Zelda game, including this one (2.5 times). However, I find it frustrating that whereas Zelda games were among the most cutting-edge on the market in the 90s, Nintendo has not only fallen this far behind the industry standards for RPG/adventure games, but it has fallen the standars set by its own games many years ago.",A disappointment

    Nintendo",1,"This is the least inspired of all the Zelda games. It's as if the developers decided, ""hey, we got a great formula here that just prints out cash for us"" so they just plug in X variable into the Zelda formula and outputs Y results which then bags them instant $. The player goes from mini-game, to puzzle, to fetch quest, to puzzle, another mini-game, over and over again. Some gamers like this formula, but how many fetch quests can you really do?The biggest crime this game commits is it's repetitive tasks. I spent a good amount of time collecting small pieces of crystal shards to form a nice big gem, only to have it yanked away and then have to find more pieces again. Why? It breaks the contract between the player and the game. If the player has to do certain repetitive tasks, then the developers have to reward the player in some way, not make the player start all over again. It feels like I've wasted my time and effort. If you like fetch quests, this is the game for you. But if you like doing repetitive tasks, then maybe you should gold farm in WOW and get actual cash in return for your effort. If I kill 500 wolves I should level up and not have to kill another 900 squids just because it's the next thing to do.In contrast Wind Waker felt like a breath of fresh air, it had a wonderfully new vibe, a narrative that guides the story along as well as innovative gameplay. What does TP have? Wolf form...so you can sniff the ground to do more fetch quests. The wolf form and twilight realm reeks of a cheap gimmick to fit the Zelda formula for new gameplay. The first few dungeons/puzzles are OK, but soon they become bland. For some reason people hate the WW cel shaded Link, what do they want Marcus ""Link"" Fenix? WW's Link FITS the fresh new world, he's not just another bland space marine. TP feels like the same bland Link, with bland dungeons, and bland world.Playing this game felt like I was holding my breath the entire time. I kept thinking to myself ""It'll get better, I'll turn around the corner and it'll be fun again, all I need to do is solve this puzzle and then it'll be fun"" ...but no... The usual Zelda charm remains, however. The game is polished to a sheen and the art direction is beautiful. But I can't keep holding my breath waiting for something that will never come.If you're a Zelda fan then you'll like this game, otherwise skip it. The developers are banking on their tried and true Zelda formula to bring in the big bucks. What is a Zelda game with uninspired gameplay and bland dungeons?  Hopefully the next Zelda Wii game, Skyward Sword, will learn from TP's mistakes and give the faithful Zelda fans what they deserve - an inspired gameworld, and fresh, innovative gameplay. the graphics suck, boring game",Same ol' Zelda formula X+Y= $

    Nintendo",1,"I just finished this game a moment ago, and boy, all I can say is booooooooring. What was with that ending? Hyrule Castle and final fight. Too short and rushed. Like the latter half of the game as a whole.The ending of Wind Waker was LEGENDARY! I yawned once I finished Twilight Princess.Listen, this game had a wonderfull beginning. I liked the cutscenes and the first time I transformed into a wolf I was in awe. But then I hated how weak and rushed the plot became. Why the hell did those orcs just drop the kids somewhere? And around the time Ilia got her memory back the plot fizzled completely. Also the plot in this game was too little about Triforce, history, the world/land of Hyrule etc. They were touched really superficially.The plot and dialogue were *extremely inferior* compared to Wind Waker.Twilight Princess was boring, choppy and jumpy after a great beginning.And the dungeons. Something was severely lacking. In the beginning they were ok, though nothing great, but then they got horrible. Like the City in the Sky and Twilight Realm. Horrible.I guess they went for quantity not quality. The dungeons were boring and repetitive, the puzzles old and they lacked any atmosphere.Also if I remember correctly in Wind Waker you had to use many of the items you had acquired in different places. Not here.This game was also *WAY too easy*. I'm not a good player, honestly, but I never once died during the game. As a matter of fact I was near perfect health nearly all the time. Once you got the Master Sword you just needed to swing the nunchuk and the enemies would vanish. I mean I'd want standard enemies that would be at least as tough as Ganon was in the final swordfight.The bosses were also very easy and somehow lamer than in Wind Waker.I liked the Wii controls and they were well planned and easy to use. But I have one complaint. Circling behind an enemy's back really didn't work that well. First you had to sidestep and then roll. But guess what, most of the time the roll (+sidestep) brought you around the enemy to where you started. It was irritating (though not by any means impossible) to hit the enemies in the back.Oh, and why did most of the characters have to look so retarded? They showed with some models that they could make neat looking ones as well...Riding on the horse was the greatest part of this game!You should really buy Wind Waker instead of this. People complain about the graphics but they're quite nice once you get used to them. And did I mention that the dialogue and plot are awesome. The Triforce Hunt is the only annoying and tedious part of that game. TP felt the same all the time after the beginning. Just scores of poorly designed dungeons and a choppy and weak plot. the graphics suck, boring game",What happened after the beginning???

    Nintendo",1,"The Wii version of Twilight Princess absolutely must never be played by anyone who has experienced the smooth, easy, and fluent controls of the GameCube version. The Wii version will make you so mad and frustrated once you find out how much you were lied to by the frauds at IGN and Game Trailers who constantly raved about its ""perfect controls"" and ""exciting gameplay"". Please! In this version of the game there is a floating fairy that corresponds to the position of the Wii Mote with the TV and Sensor Bar, and you are required to keep this fairy dead center in the middle of the screen or else Link will walk off in another direction, constantly falling off annoying small and big ledges, causing you to lose your balance and slowing you down immensely. Your wrist will very quickly become strained from having to aim the Wii Mote dead center in the middle of the screen continually during gameplay. Sometimes in the heat of the moment if you accidentally aim the fairy too high, too low, too far to the left, or too far to the right of the screen, you have to struggle for a few seconds to get the fairy pointing back to where you want it to be because there's a major lag when it goes to one of the ends of the screen. THIS MAJOR FLAW RUINED THE GAME! The fairy ruined this game! The game became unplayable because of this major flaw and I refused to play past the first dungeon because of this major flaw with the controls. The game is unplayable!The frauds on YouTube constantly boasted about how perfect this game was, making statements about how wonderful the Wii Mote controls are and how good it feels to swing the sword around. Total BS! Total BS. You don't swing the sword around at all. All you do is flick your wrist around and Link moves the sword in correspondence to a predetermined set of directions. You can't aim where the sword goes, it goes either in an upward/downward slice, a horizontal left/right slash, or a forward stab. And nothing more! You can't move the sword around like a virtual reality game as it was advertised to be, you can't move the sword in any direction you want, the sword goes in a limited, predetermined set of directions.The shield was even worse, remember WindWaker, Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, you held a button when you wanted the shield and let go of the button when you didn't want the shield. This added an element of challenge and fun to the Zelda franchise. When Nintendo designed Twilight Princess they decided to remove all elements of challenge and fun from the game in both the GameCube and Wii versions. In the GameCube version, when you pressed the L button to target an enemy, the shield will be constantly in use and you will never, ever get hit by an enemy, making it the easiest Zelda during the time with no challenge, no fun, no strategy. The Wii version, my goodness, it's the exact same problem except that when you need to hit an enemy with the shield, you had to punch at the screen with the nunchuk in hand and the annoying wire connecting the nunchuk to the Wii Mote would flicker about when doing this. That's a good reason not to advertise the Wii Mote as a wireless controller because it's not wireless when you have to connect the nunchuk to it.The annoying challenge when fishing in Ocarina of Time from having to hold down on both the R and the A buttons has become even worse in this game. Imagine those same issues, except you have to cast with the Wii mote by flinging it in a throwing motion across the screen, than when a fish bites, having to pull up for long minutes hurting your wrist as the Wii Mote vibrates with its built in rumble feature. Bad enough? How about this, you have to rotate the nunchuk in a circular motion hurting your other arm simply to reel the fish in. This doesn't feel like real fishing, STOP LYING TO YOURSELVES. This was by no means a successful execution of a fishing simulation.Horse back riding was destroyed by the Wii Mote and Nunchuk since you have to keep the on screen fairy dead center in the middle of the screen or else the horse, like Link, will also move in another direction slowing you down where it takes forever for her to regain momentum and balance after running you into obstacles and cliffs. Just flick your wrist to make Link slash at enemies making the onscreen fairy move all about, causing you to lose balance just so you can fight the only three boar riding moblin archers in all of Hyrule field.Same thing when controlling the wolf. Controlling the wolf is even more annoying, having to flick your wrist with the Wii Mote to make him attack in the direction corresponding to the onscreen fairy. In the GameCube version the wolf is very well balanced and doesn't usually fall off annoying cliffs if you don't move perfectly. In this version it's much worse because you have to keep the fairy dead center in the middle of the screen while moving the wolf, making him jump from cliff to cliff, or when flicking your wrist to attack enemies. All of this makes the wolf controls needlessly challenging in the Wii version.This is awful, this was the worst experience I've ever had playing Zelda. Bottom line, all the same problems that are present in the GameCube version with the lack of challenge, really easy to kill enemies and bosses are in this version but this version is much worse because of the controls of the Wii Mote and Nunchuk. I only bought the Nintendo Wii just to see if the Wii version of this game was superior to the GameCube version, as I was lead to believe it was more challenging. The only challenge came from the atrocious controls of the Wii Mote and Nunchuk. the graphics suck, boring game","Please, for goodness sake buy the GameCube version instead"

    Nintendo",2,"Overall, the game graphics are good and worthwhile to spend your free time challenging yourself.What really annoys me are instances in the game where, when you die and restart at a checkpoint, you start off without having the necessary tools or resources to move on. Near the start of the game, for example, when you are chasing a monkey that the kids are going after. In order to catch the monkey, you need the horse to jump over a gate. When I was killed at a point beyond the gate, I started at a checkpoint where I had no horse and there was that same gate in front of me. Well, I looked around for the horse but found nothing. So I figured the horse must have ended up somewhere beyond the gate.So I quit after not finding the horse to go over the obstacle. You may encounter similar glitches throughout several points in the game. It's not much of a game when you can't move over obstacles, not because it is challenging, but because you are unable to.",Good storyline. Can get stuck with absolutely no way to move on.

    Nintendo",2,"Okay so I bought a Wii, and Zelda was the must-have launch title, right? Wrong! To those who are crazy in love with this game, they are welcome to it. To all others, I say ""Don't Believe the Hype.""First, there's the Wii control scheme. In the product description, it says:""This new control scheme allows for much faster and more accurate control than on previous Nintendo hardware. For example, waving the remote in the air will result in Link performing the same move with the sword. To fire off on arrow, players ""pull back"" on a virtual controller string as the Wii remote's speaker lets players know that the projectile is ready for release.""Okay, waving the sword does NOT make Link do the same move. That's not even possible without the Wii Motion Plus. And ""pulling back"" an arrow? Since when? I never had to pull back on anything.This is obviously a Gamecube port. The Wii controls are tacked on. That's okay though, because I love the Gamecube! But forget the controls. What about the actual gameplay?This game is very linear. And it holds your hand for far too long. I found that 10 hours into the game, I was still being tutored - for no reason. You'll feel like one of the goats you get to herd in the game. Oh yes, the goat herding... You are Link, the awesome chosen hero. Who fights evil by herding goats.And that brings me to something else that drives me nuts about these newer Zelda games. Why is it that you have to spend HOURS doing stupid menial tasks at the beginning of the game? It's a definite turnoff to any new player. I persevered, hoping it would get better. But after chasing monkeys and running from bees and finding a lost cat and reading dumb cut scenes involving a bunch of whiny kids, I kept thinking, ""For God's sake, just give me a dang sword and let me get on with it already!"" It's like Nintendo punishes you for wanting to fight by making you do a bunch of stupid stuff beforehand.PLEASE Nintendo, learn something here. Give people a sword AT THE BEGINNING. Throw them in the action, and let them figure it out as they go. I mean let's face it, the story always boils down to collect all pieces of whatever in the dungeons and killing Gannon. Why make this complicated? What else is there to understand?But it's not all bad. The graphics were wonderful. More along the lines of Ocarina of Time, and definitely an improvement over the Windwaker. But too bad Twilight Princess's realistic landscape was completely populated by ridiculous, annoying, cartoony characters.I also liked the music, particularly during some of god scenes. Very well done.The use of the portals was very good. Definitely an improvement over Windwaker, where you used to set your sail then leave the room for an hour while you waited to finally get there. I was thankful for that!And I've got to say, the wolf concept was awesome. Playing as the wolf is one of the coolest things you get to do in the game. I really enjoyed that part. It's too bad it is tainted somewhat by that stupid midget riding on your back.Which brings me to one of the worst things in the game: Midna. Never has a sidekick ever been so annoying. Do you like to be mocked and told what to do all the time? And her pseudo-Japanese baby-talk voice was awful. That got really obnoxious after a while. Why does Link need a sidekick, anyway? Can't he just figure stuff out on his own like in the original NES Legend of Zelda?The dungeons were fun. Well designed, but a little too linear. You don't really have any choice in how you beat them. There's pretty much one path to take and once you've figured it out, that's it.The gameplay was a major step back. Or a step down, if you will. The enemies were the worst. They were complete pushovers! In other games like Windwaker or Metroid: Prime, you get a sense of dread when a giant enemy fills the whole room and towers over you. Not in this game! Here, you can just laugh at them because you already know that you are going to beat them without dying once. I couldn't believe how easy it was. At first I thought it was annoying that it took 5 pieces of heart to make a heart container instead of 4. Seemed like a lot of work. But in retrospect, why bother anyway? You'll never need more than about 6 hearts to beat the toughest boss.Last night I finally realized that I've had it with this game. I had spent over an hour - AN HOUR! - literally searching for an ant. At that point I realized that I did not want to waste any more time on stupid side-quests and mini-games. I'm already over 40 hours into the game, and I'm wondering if it is ever going to end. I think I've got 3 dungeons left to go. But right now I'm not so sure that I can summon the will to continue. This game has a way of sucking the life out of you. But I am a POWER PLAYER, so I shall endure!GOOD:GraphicsMusicPlaying as a WolfBAD:Most obnoxious, annoying sidekick everGoat herdingSumo wrestling (has our hero really been reduced to this?)Menial tasksBORING cutscenesSmall world to explore, compared to other gamesEnemies are a total pushoverI wish I could recommend it, but I just can't.

    Nintendo",1,"My family and I are Super Smash Bros. Addicts. We played the N64 version almost daily, and when Melee appeared we happily switched to it. So needless to say, when Brawl came out, I snapped it up. I even bought a Wii for its sake.I am so foolish for not renting it first.Something struck me as odd about it from day one, but I still played it religiously, seeking to amass the entire roster and earn every trophy, sticker, and level. For a while, this manic pursuit hid many of its glaring flaws from me. But I finally realized when I earned Jigglypuff that this was not the game that I had fallen in love with in middle school.First of all, don't play this with the Wiimote. You need to move precisely, and for that, you should get a Gamecube controller.Story Mode outright stinks. It's a platformer, straight and simple--and what a sucky platformer it is! Not since 8-bit adventure games have I died more times because of surprising death traps hidden just off screen or character-killing abysses that magically appear at the worst moments. The story is all kinds of goofy and far too long. It's only fun if you play with a friend. As far as being introduced to all of the characters in the game--it's a good idea. But other than that, WHY would you want to play it?Online Mode also stinks. You have to play with anonymous random players, and you can't play with friends unless you have their codes. Also, if you're playing in random online matches, you can't sit with your buddy in the same room and play in a random online match together. What?! Why?! You can do this when you're connected with a Friend, but it's just not the same thing.There are now so many items that it is crowded and overly complicated. Some items are so small that you have no idea what you have grabbed until you chunk it at someone. These are problems I never would have foreseen. Smash Balls are irritating, merely a way to disrupt game play. The appearance of one starts everyone on a wild chase across the level, until one annoying sod grabs it and then starts nabbing cheap KOs.It's hard for me not to compare the rest of this game to Melee, because Melee did it so right. My family have played Melee for seven years. All other games were beaten and set aside to gather dust; we played this one every day. So please excuse me as I contrast and compare.Brawl is a great deal like Melee, but has some small differences that make a big impact on how the game is played. In Melee, every character played differently and had to be learned, and it was difficult to kill a good player by button mashing. But in Brawl, they all play the same way. You can button mash very successfully. I knew something was wrong when I could switch around from character to character and, regardless of who the character was, play them all equally well.Also, for some reason it seems like the ""heavy hitters"" don't do a lot of damage like they should (like Bowser, King Dedede, Donkey Kong--all characters I prefer). Take Bowser. A well-placed headbutt in Melee, and I could kill somebody pretty quickly. Now, it takes two or three good headbutts to finally kill somebody. Whether this is because the levels are higher and wider or the moves are weaker, I'm not certain. They've also neutered some of the more powerful moves, like Jigglypuff's Rest and Rollout.In fact, just the way they've knocked off Jigglypuff as a power player really irritates me. I used to play her all of the time to freak people out, because in Melee it was very difficult to control her and use her powerful moves. If you mastered the moves you could be terrifying. I can only imagine that the game's developers had friends who were good with Jigglypuff, because now she is basically useless. Rest is just a good way to have a Smash Attack centered on your fat fluffy head. Rollout is like being lightly tapped by an old woman. And Sing doesn't put anyone to sleep longer than two seconds. Why did they even bother to put her on the roster?One of my pet peeves is the way you fall in Brawl: you float gently down to earth like a fairy angel. In Melee, every character had a certain weight/gravity and fell in different, ""realistic"" ways. This does affect how you fight--how quickly you can jump back into battle, and how easily others can aim for you. Jigglypuff's slow falls in Melee made her an excellent target for Link's arrows and Samus's rockets; Fox, who practically smashes into the ground in one second, is another story.Now let's talk about the levels. You remember the Ice Climber level from Melee? You know that one you didn't play because you have to think about jumping up to the next level every five seconds? What made them think we needed MORE levels like that? In Brawl, several of the levels are just fricking annoying. You often have to concentrate more on dealing with the problems that the level gives you rather than fighting other characters. For example, in one level all of your directional buttons are switched around so that you have to play with ""opposite buttons."" I cannot stress enough how UNBELIEVABLY ANNOYING THIS IS. Several levels have so much going on at one time that it's mind-boggling. Not to say that environmental peril can't be fun--it is. And yes, some of the levels got the right balance of environmental peril and character play right--but very few. The Pirate Ship, Pictochat, and the Wario level are hilarious and awesome, for example. Nothing like chucking your enemy into a bomb on the Pirate Ship!Long story short, Brawl is easier to pick up by new players, plays more like a fluffy arcade game, and seems to be geared for little kids who aren't used to disappointment. This can be good and it can be bad, and obviously, if you've never played the other games in the franchise, you may not give a care. But for an old Melee player, this feels like nothing short of a tragedy. I suppose it's all right, in the end; my family and I STILL go to Melee over Brawl. the graphics suck, boring game","If It Isn't Broken, Don't Fix It"

    Nintendo",1,"When I first got this game, I probably would have rated it higher. It's got an all-star Nintendo cast with a couple of special guests from third-party titles and an interesting adventure mode.My problem with this game (and I realize I'm in a small minority here) is that the controls are just plain terrible and ruin the overall experience. I managed to get through a lot of Subspace Emissary (or whatever it's called) and unlocked most if not all of the characters, but the game does not allow the save data to be backed up, and when my Wii broke down for some unexplainable reason, those morons at Nintendo repair erased all the data when they fixed te console. Having to unlock everything again is not fun. It's the opposite of fun. It's a crap-fest with lousy controls that can make simple tasks like hitting switches and even jumping from on platform to another a frustrating chore. I don't know who thought requiring analog controls for side-scrollers was a good idea, but that person should be banned from having any input for game design. The d-pad can be used for moving, but only when using the Wii remote alone, which has more limited buttons; with a Classic Controller and GameCube controller (which only works with older Wiis), it's control stick only while the d-pads are used for taunting and, if you can somehow pull it off, changing Samus' look.The occasional auto-scrolling in the adventure mode that I originally saw in Super Mario Bros 3 also adds to the frustration.Now I get what some of you might be thinking: &#34;This guy sucks at video games and is blaming the games for his problems.&#34; I need only wait for some comments to confirm this. If you don't find the controls terrible, then you'll probably love this game, but that doesn't mean everyone has to.And in case you're wondering if this is some sort of Sony fanboy rant, I don't care for PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale either; that game is little more than a piss-poor clone (albeit with different characters) that blatantly reminds the player of the premium add-on content he or she didn't buy on the selection screens.I may edit my review from time to time, but I'm not changing my mind no matter how much flaming backlash I get.",Awful controls ruin the experience.

A shame because I truly love the Zelda games, and the game would probably be very good if they didn't force these ridiculous controls on us.

    Nintendo",2,"It kinda sucks writing reviews about games that have already been reviewed by a bunch of people. For one, less people are likely to read another review about the same game, just to hear the same story blah blah blah ...So the sum of the reviews is that Children of Mana is a mediocre game, and that is no lie. I can't say much about the Mana series, because the only other Mana I've played was Secret of Mana, and I absolutely loved it. Then again, I loved every single RPG on the SNES.Children of Mana is addictive in the beginning, but only in the way that most character developing games are addicting; you want to level up you character. Something in your gaming soul drives you to want to level up your character, in the same inane way you want to ""Catch Them All!"" or level up your Pokemon for hours upon hours for no apparent reason whatsoever. To which you'll soon discover the horrible redundancy of this game.Children of Mana is a dungeon crawler, and a horribly made one at that. Simply put, the title ""Pinball of Mana"" would have been more befitting than Children of Mana. Hitting monsters causes the monster to bounce back into some other object in the dungeon which in turn begins to bounce around, and at some point in this pinball-like movement, you get hit and you start bouncing around until you finally hit something and stop bouncing. Then you repeat the process all over again.I was extremely disappointed, since I had taken such a long hiatus from gaming and was looking forward to my first Mana title since Secret. The main story is drabby, and chock full of long boring dungeon crawling. The side quests, which make the game infinitely longer, are more boring, more elongated dungeon crawling. It seems like there's no end to the redundancy.Still, some people like that, and it could consume hours upon hours of brainless hacking and chopping and bouncing around. If that's what you're into, this game was made especially for you. But please, don't buy it for the retail $29.99.Hopefully Heroes of Mana will redeem the Mana series... I've heard some disappointing remarks about the other Mana titles, and would love to see a great followup to the legendary RPGs of the SNES...Yes, I am calling for a DS Chrono title, or a Gaia title, Lufia title ..

    Nintendo",2,"Children of Mana is the latest Squenix addition to a long line of Mana RPG/adventure games that have moved into the Nintendo handheld world - this one being a game for the DS. And out of all the mana games I've played, it is by far the worst, and possibly one of the worst RPG games I've played. From story to game mechanics, this is almost a complete lemon, so if you dislike negative reviews, just skip this. I'll try and summarize the paragraphs so you can get my main points without having to read my entire tirade.Complete lack of utilization for the DS hardware.The first thing I noticed about the game is the complete lack of stylus play, and the poor utilization of the dual-screen system. There's all this fantastic hardware for DS, and most of the games I've played have used it to some good effect, but CoM almost completely ignores it, opting to use one screen for maps/status when in most cases, your maps and status aren't really needed. After the opening screen, the stylus is not used at all. In fact, I have to wonder why they even put that one touch-screen in there.Complete lack of character story.Even in the last GBA handheld installment of the series, the story had depth. Your characters had a history, and a reason why they met. And the supporting characters had some really touching material. In CoM, the village priestess is kidnapped, and all the village elders and warriors get together to discuss what must be done. Your character, who seems to have no real station in the village, voulenteers him/herself to go, and everyone is just like ""bai. the potions shop is to your right on your way out of the village."" Not even a ""no, it's too dangerous!"" or ""let me teach you how to fight before you go."" And that's only the first of many such oddities. Either the localization team has completely butchered and removed whatever insightful dialog existed, or it just never did.Complete lack of storySort of ties in with my last point. At the end of each zone, you fight a boss monster, and someone comes out to tell you ""good job"" and give you the tiniest scrap of explanation and some artifact that allows you to access a new area of the game. You go back to the village, speak with the veteran, and he asks you to go scope out another crisis. Of the handful of zones I've been to, that's been the extent of it. Sidequests are available through a shop, but you never meet who you're helping, and the fun of discovering the sidequest is eliminated because they're just handed to you. So far (though I'm assuming this changes later), there are no towns to explore, and no benefits to talking to people.Weak character developmentAnd by character development, I mean level progression and the like. Most of your development happens through the aquisition of new weapons and armor, and the equipping of various gems you find. You can fuse gems together to create new gems with special powers. But that's pretty much it - no points to spend of any kind. All of your weapons and armor can be purchased from the shop, so questing for special weapons and armor is pointless. Furthermore, all wares have a level requirement, so apart from gems, there's no good way to max out a particular stat.Shallow and frustrating gameplay elementsYour 8 espers exist, but you can only take one of them into a dungeon with you, as opposed to previous games, where you do work to find the mana, and then its unique powers are available to you through the rest of the game. You cannot access the weapons, armor, or gems you pick up while you're still in the dungeon, or swap out your esper, until you've reached a save point. Each dungeon has multiple levels, and if you leave or die, you have to start the dungeon over again (or simply restart your game from your save point if you reached one while in-dungeon). The new gameplay mechanics are not always explained in the best way, such that I had to actually look up how to use and switch my espers.The only positives...There are four weapons that allow you to complete some puzzle-aspects in the dungeon, and you have the ability to dual-wield so you don't have to keep switching weapons, which is nice. The graphics are cute - the whole game definitely looks just like a mana game, and there are even a few anime-style cutscenes. Your performance in each dungeon section is scored off how many monsters you kill, how many chests you find, and how fast you do it in - and from this, you can get special rewards. There's a multiplayer option, which is new and supposed to be pretty fun.The lowdownI was surprised to find this used so quickly, considering it only came out a short while ago, but now I see why. By itself, any one of these flaws wouldn't be enough to ruin the game, but this many annoyances and shortage of RP aspects together make it an almost worthless pursuit. It's fine for a dungeon crawl, but with so little rewards, why not just replay a more compelling dungeon crawl game? I recommend D2 for solo play, and Gauntlet, Zelda Four Swords, or FF Crystal Chronicles for really fantastic multi-player dungeoncrawl. And, if you're interested in how the Mana series is done well on a handheld, pick up Sword of Mana.","Dungeon Crawl with Little Reward, Creativity"

    Nintendo",2,"C'mon, I tried to come up with that title pun for about five minutes.It's been almost 17 months since a new Pokemon game came out. Pokemon Emerald, that last game, wasn't an all-new adventure but it featured a few new touches to the same old Pokemon formula, and that kept fans playing the game. So much time has passed and Pokemon fans like me were left wondering when they'd be able to feed that Pokemon craving. Nintendo, Creatures, and Game Freak let Chunsoft take the reins, and the product was the multi-platform Pokemon Mystery Dungeon series. That last statement is quite possibly the knife in the back of this year's only new Pokemon release: Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, in both the Rescue Team Red GBA version and the Rescue Team Blue DS version, is a repetitive game that lacks the life, charm, energy, and fun of the rest of the games in the ever-growing Pokemon franchise.In Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, you assume the role of a human-turned-Pokemon. What Pokemon you are depends on your answers of a few personality-based questions at the start of the game. The ""twist"" here is that there are no humans in this Pokemon land, and you communicate with other Pokemon to partake in rescue missions throughout the land. Sadly, few of the Pokemon have anything interesting to say that doesn't pertain to rescue missions, so the game feels like a linear affair. Take rescue missions, beat rescue missions, and repeat the process until the game's over and you can go to some of the ""secret"" and more dangerous dungeons.The dungeons themselves are extremely boring. I absolutely hated them. They're big, randomly-generated maps with freely-roaming and constantly-respawning wild Pokemon to battle. You can find items and traps throughout the dungeon as well, but that's very generic for the random-dungeon RPG genre. The random designs don't include any sort of interesting environmental attributes, so you're mostly running down hallways and looking for the stairway to the next floor of the dungeon. As the game progresses, the dungeons get bigger but never better. After a very short while, I just started looking for the exit to each floor as quickly as possible, which made leveling up a difficult thing to do.The battle gameplay is very similar to other Pokemon games, but it's all done in a touchy real-time system. You'll run up to monsters, select an attack, and wait for the opponent to die before moving onto the next one. Unfortunately, since this game has freely-roaming enemies, it is possible to get surrounded by enemies, which makes everything even more frustrating. The battles aren't fun and with each wild Pokemon I found, I simply wanted to move on as quickly as possible. Since you can't capture Pokemon (you're not a trainer, after all), there is almost no fun to be had while battling monsters in this game. You'll get more Pokemon on your team as you go through the game, and there are specific areas where certain Pokemon can join your team, but you won't be able to catch and raise them as you please. There is some depth to developing your rescue team. For example, you can change their A.I., IQ, and battle settings. Because of this, CPU-controlled Pokemon can interact with the environment and different situations in a more intelligent fashion. This doesn't make the battle system any more interesting, though, ultimately making Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team a sickening dud when it comes to gameplay.Getting to a Game Over screen has never been okay in a Pokemon game, but Pokemon Mystery Dungeon takes that frustration to a whole new level: if you die, every single item in your 20-item inventory toolbox is lost and you must restart the dungeon from the very beginning. This makes the repetitive, generic dungeons even more frustrating to get through and the dull battles even duller.Visually, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team is a GBA game at heart. DS owners will be very disappointed with the basic sprites, horribly dull environments, and lackluster attack animation. The only saving grace visually is the art, which is quite nice. The sound effects are as generic as they have been since Pokemon Blue and Red, and the music is less catchy and more annoying.Fans of random dungeon hacks might find a little to enjoy here, since Pokemon Mystery Dungeon is a very generic random dungeon hack-and-slash RPG. But Pokemon fans should tough it out and wait for Pokemon Pearl and Pokemon Diamond to come out next year, because Pokemon Mystery Dungeon is like nothing you've played before, and it's nothing interesting, either. There are so many better GBA games out there and so many better DS games coming out that dropping $35 for either version of Pokemon Mystery Dungeon is a waste of your hard-earned cash.",Rescue Team Red and Blue -- a Don't-Duo.

All these RPGs were simple, yet for some reason delightful to play.  Now Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Red and Blue come out, and it seems I had my hopes up for this one.  It's no where near as interesting, and it's even sadder that even on the Nintendo DS the game just didn't go above and beyond.The basic premise of the story is, like every Pokemon game, rather simple.  You're an aspiring trainer who one day falls asleep only to wake up as a pokemon.  The pokemon you wake up as depends on how you answer the questions at the start of the new game.  You'll also be able to choose a pokemon partner who will be the one that awakens you.  You and your partner will find yourself in a world completely full of pokemon.  Unfortunately all is not safe.  You and your ally will soon discover that other pokemon are always in need of help in this new world.  So it's up to you to answer ditress calls of other pokemon, go to the specified dungeon and save them.  It's basic.  It's simple.  And throughout your journey you won't see one trainer.  Ever.Since there are no trainers, one has to wonder how to expand upon their party.  Well, you still get new pokemon from the wild as you did before, but it's slightly different.  When you defeat a wild pokemon they will offer to join your team.  Learning moves however is almost exactly the same as previous games.  By leveling and through TMs.  You can also team up and perform moves as well.All these things are really engrossing, and they've got some neat things going for it, but it doesn't separate from the things you begin to notice as you trek through the game.  The first being that most of the game is just boring.  The dungeon floors are randomly generated and sometimes the exit will be right next to the entrance.  Although that's not such a bad thing when battling is a fairly uneventful task anyway.  The AI of your allies is horrible, yet they can still hold their own in a battle against an enemy.  Even bosses are easily taken down by your party.The worst part may very well be that the true core of the gameplay doesn't come out until you've completed the main story.  More abilities become available after.  You're finally able to take control of other Pokemon after.  Your Pokemon also won't evolve until you complete the main story.What would a Pokemon game be without two versions?  There's the Blue version which is on the Nintendo DS, and then the Red version which is on the GBA.  Don't be fooled, however.  They're basically the same game.  Just like every other set of Pokemon games, though, each version has exclusive pokemon.The saving grace of this set up, however, is all the connectivity features that can be done.  If you insert both games into your DS at a time, you can import Pokemon from one game to another.  This is an easy way to get all of them. It's also really neat that you can trade items, missions, and pokemon this way.  In addition, if you get KO'd in a dungeon and your party gets wiped out, you could send out a message to your friend and he/she will have to come and rescue you.  The connectivity features are very engrossing.  And of course, you can hook up via wireless (for DS owners) or link cable (GBA owners) and battle with your friends.Pokemon Mystery Dungeon doesn't really look all that great.  It's no surprise, Pokemon games never look fantastic graphically.  If you want to know the truth, the DS version looks exactly like the GBA version.  There's hardly any difference between them.  The game is certainly colorful, but there's just not enough variety in the environments and there are hardly any 3D effects brought out.  For the Nintendo DS, which has to compete with far better looking games it's really hard for it to hold it's own here.Worse than the graphics is the sound, though.  A lot of the sound effects and such come directly from the normal gameboy games that are almost ten years old.  The music itself isn't so bad, but it is quite repetitive.  Again, however, it's no surprise because as usual, Pokemon games don't usually push a system to its limits.It's hard to suggest Pokemon Mystery Dungeon.  It's a Pokemon game, but it's a rather bland Pokemon game.  It's neat that you can finally play as a Pokemon, but the game as a whole could've been presented far better than it actually was.  There's little variety to it, actually, which is really sad considering how big and expansive previous Pokemon games are.  It's got plenty of rescue missions, but after a while they're much more repetitive than exciting.  I can't suggest one buy this.  Even the most die hard of Pokemon fans will have trouble getting into this game.On the positive side+You actually play as the Pokemon and not the trainer+There's plenty of connectivity stuff to be done between both versions, mastering the game as a whole will take a really long time+There's never an end to rescue missions, even long after you've completed the story modeOn the negative side-Battles are too easy-The AI for your enemies and allies are bad, yet the game is still easy, and your AI controlled characters are still competent enough to get through the battle without you-Most of the more interesting tweaks of the game are available only AFTER story mode is complete-Graphically the game doesn't hold up-The sound effects are absolutely terrible",This Game Itself is a Mystery

    Nintendo",2,"I'm a longtime fan of the traditional pokemon games (like Pokemon Pearl and Diamond), so when I saw this spin-off, I was pretty excited.  Unfortunately, it took me a long time to actually get around to playing this game (various reasons I won't go into).  It seems with Pokemon Ranger that they were looking to emphasize the RPG gameplay a bit more than the monster-raising aspects.  Well, I was excited to play this, but unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish the game.  I normally do not write reviews for games I haven't finished, but I feel I need to write a review on this to warn people who may be unable to finish for the same reason I did.  Just check the gameplay section for those details...  Since I got roughly half-way through the game, every other category's judgment is based on that experience.Graphics (score 7/10): Graphics aren't too bad at all.  In fact, they look better than the traditional Pokemon games, even the most recent Pokemon Black and White.  The character models are just more detailed looking and actually have more animations.  Compared to games on the DS in general, the graphics are pretty average looking; nothing too special but also nothing bad.Music (score 7/10): Once again, ""average"" is the word of choice I'd use to describe this category.  The music is pretty standard fare for anyone who's familiar with Pokemon games.  It's just simple, but pleasant, ambient RPG-esque tunes.  Nothing irritating, but nothing that stands out too much either.Characters (score 7/10): Well, as is par for the course for Pokemon games, the characters are pretty simplistic.  You have your ubiquitous ""Professor"" character, and several NPCs.  You can choose which gender you prefer to be, but either way, your protagonist doesn't have much personality.  The rest of the characters have a bit more personality, but not much compared to real RPGs.  Of course, the pokemon series was always aimed at children, and as such, have pretty simple characters, so I can't really mark off too many points in this category.Story (score 7/10): Well, I've only managed to experience half of the story, but I've played all the traditional pokemon games so I already know what to expect.  Basically, it's the same old formula with your protagonist, a criminal organization (the Go-Rock Squad) who's hilariously incompetent, themes of friendship with pokemon, etc.  The story is moved forward by going on missions.  Basically, you are a new Ranger and the Ranger Station just gives you missions to complete.  These missions will consist of something like ""go into the forest and rescue a lost person"".  Once you finish one mission, the story moves forward and you get another mission.  That's about it.  The story is sub-par compared to the average RPG, but for a pokemon game, it's pretty average.Gameplay (score 4/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  Well, here it is - the category that made me stop playing the game.  This pokemon game differs from the traditional ones in a major way - there are no turn-based battles.  Instead, you can capture ""friend"" pokemon using the stylus by drawing loops around them on the touchscreen.  You also don't get to keep any of the pokemon that you capture.  They stay temporarily as you work on missions and leave once the mission is done.  You'll also need to capture certain pokemon to clear environmental obstacles (like using a cyndaquil to burn a log blocking your path).  As for the stylus capturing method, this is really what got me.  At first, it wasn't bad at all.  In fact, I thought the new gameplay mechanic was fresh and interesting.  However, as soon as I got to the section with the Jungle Relic and the trials, the difficulty spikes immensely.  I really was caught off guard.  You can't use any friend pokemon to help you in here, leaving you with only your partner pokemon who's completely ineffectual for these difficult captures.  I've tried about twenty times, and I just can't do it.  I even went seeking some FAQs to see if there was some great technique I was missing or something, but they all just said things like ""be fast and good luck"".  Yeah, thanks for that.  I physically cannot go any faster, and I'm afraid to just go crazy with the thing anyways lest I scratch my lovely DS screen.  I've had the thing for five whole years now and there isn't a single scratch on the screen, and I'll be darned if I cause one now!  I'll be honest here, maybe I'm just a crappy gamer and that's why I can't do it.  I've primarily been a connoisseur of turn-based RPGs and point-and-click adventure games up to this point since I just don't have good reflexes.  While I have a large number of games in my collection and count myself a serious gamer (I've finished and reviewed over sixty games), I just can't play certain types of games.  Normally I'd just chalk up this game as not being bad in and of itself, but just too hard for me.  No hard feelings and such.  However, this game is specifically aimed towards kids.  I feel that the difficulty level is unfair for them regardless of whether I can finish the game or not.  Not to mention, even if it didn't get so difficult, the gameplay would soon grow pretty stale and repetitive since it's a simple mechanic without much depth to it.Overall (score 4/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  I don't normally dock a game score this low when there's not much wrong with it, but being unable to finish a game really detracts for me.  Plus, I really just can't recommend this game to anyone.  Kids are quickly going to get frustrated with it's difficulty, and fans of the deep battle mechanics from the other pokemon games are not going to find much here to satisfy them.  The storyline isn't going to win any awards, and the gameplay (even if it isn't too hard for you) is just repetitive and tedious.  I find myself unable to really recommend this to anyone.  If you are a long-time fan of the pokemon franchise, just play Black and White until a new generation comes out and skip Pokemon Ranger altogether.  If you are new to pokemon, definitely don't start with this game.  Try one of the more traditional pokemon games; you'll have much more enjoyable gameplay that will give you a much deeper, more cerebral experience as you plan teams and battle strategies and such.  Just pick up Pokemon Black, White, Pearl, Diamond, Platinum, Heart Gold, or Soul Silver instead of this spin-off.  I guarantee one of those will bring you a much more fulfilling experience than Pokemon Ranger would.","Sadly, I Wasn't Able To Finish This Game..."

I do not have arthritis, and am far from old, but this game made my hands cramp so bad because you have to use the stylus AND the buttons throughout the whole game which is extremely fast paced, so apparently an octopus invented this one.

    Nintendo",2,"I was hoping for this Mario sports title to be as good as others in the past. It isn't. Its gameplay hinges on using the stylus for everything except moving. That's never good.To dribble the ball, you have to continually tap the screen, which gets annoying after too long. You also have to memorize which way to swipe the stylus to make any shot, so if you're like me, you'll just memorize one shot and keep using it till it goes out of style.You pick three of your favorite characters to be on your team and face off 'tourney-style' against 3 other groups. That's kinda nice, but unlike Mario tennis or the other Mario sports games, your computer team mates cannot interact with the ball. You have to press the 'L' or 'R' button to switch to different members, and then control them to pick up the ball. Again, this gets really old really quick.All in all, I didn't find it much fun. Maybe I'm in the minority, but I can't really recommend this to anyone.","Eh, not horrible."

I am only writing this review now because Amazon sent me an e-mail recommending it.This game is just terrible, an insult to the legacy of Yoshi's Island.  It is best summarized by probably its biggest issue: this game uses both screens of the DS for gameplay, but the space BETWEEN the screens is also used, meaning that there is a blind spot in the VERY CENTER of the gameplay.  It is nothing but frustration when you keep getting hit by enemies that come out of nowhere from that blind spot, and especially when you play the levels with moving platforms you find yourself being force to play with your character in that blind spot.Any platformer that thinks it's okay for your character to be invisible knows nothing about good platforming.I also remember disliking the bosses, but it's been so long that I can't quite remember why.",Why did Amazon recommend me this title?

Elite Beat Agents uses either unheard of or ancient songs such as YMCA. Basically, it seems like they just looked for the cheapest music licenses they could find.

    Nintendo",1,Owned since the release of the console and it's still mint. The controller is poorly developed that I wouldn't recommend it to anyone at any price. The first thing that needs to be known about this controller is its awkward design. It does not fit comfortably in your hand at all. The rear button springs take a bit of effort to push in as you can't exactly just tap them. They are so stiff that you can actually hear the springs. The two analog sticks are extremely close together. You'll be rubbing your thumbs together more than anything else... and aside from all this the worse feature is the location of the attachment cord. It is always in the way since it faces you. This controller is the worst design I have ever used in over 20 years of gaming. The original nintendo controller with its square and jagged shape that cut into your hands after hours of play was better than this.When the classic controller PRO was released I felt relieved and it should have been made sooner. If you need a classic controller skip this and get the latest version it's worlds apart and all the features I just mentioned have been changed. The new controller features softer trigger button springs so now you can gently tap buttons as you play. The center analog sticks are further apart so your thumbs have space now. The best part of all is that the cord is in the back where it belongs! Out of your way and off your lap. My favorite part about the CCpro is that it has palm handles and it feels so comfortable to use. The Classic controller shown here is nintendo's mistake. Make the right choice and get the improvement with the classic controller pro.,Awful....absolutely awful.

videogame director/creator/producer THIS is the game that should change your mind about that.Majora's Mask's game world and design utterly radiates Aonuma's total lack of charisma and incompetence throughout.From the goofy stupid moon above (which Aonuma/Nintendo fan lemmings constantly scream is ""OMG MATURE AND DARK!!111!!"") to the obnoxiously nasty remixed music of The Legend Of  Zelda: A Link To The Past's overworld theme this Aonuma Zelda offering, (the first of far too many) began the viscious cycle of Aonuma becoming the turd in The Legend Of Zelda's proverbial punch bowl and thus the Zelda series began it's steep decline in sales as it slides down Aonuma's creativity colon into the commode known as the bomba bin, where it then is flushed and deposited in the septic sewer of unsustainability.This game is the penultimate game for non entities and Aonuma's fellow traveller charisma deficients to cling on to and claim is oh so great in a pathetic attempt to make themselves look artsy, edgy and cultured as a result because *wink wink* reader, they know something about Majora's Mask that WE don't know...or so their asperger's syndrome/autism addled minds makes them think.Yes indeed followers, lemmings and mental defectives are Majora's Masks main audience ie hipsters, liberal geldings, guys who get barb wire tattoos on their biceps because they think it makes them look tough etc. THOSE are the kind of weirdos that are drawn to defending Majora's Mask on gaming forums and making it out like it is the second coming when all it is in reality is Eiji Aonuma's second attempt at playing game designer.Well his first attempt with ""Marvelous"" failed abysmally and his constant inability to learn his lesson (and quit while he's ahead) has unsurprisingly resulted in another sales bomb for him with this trash known as Majora's Mask which I am reviewing for you Amazon's game customers now.The internet lames petition to have Majora's Mask made into a 3DS game has predictably and utterly (not to mention gloriously) failed because Nintendo knows what I know and that is Majora's Mask was a dud when it originally launched thus its not like its suddenly going to light the world on fire if it's re-released now.Oh the Nintendo fan lemmings and Nintendo damage controllists continually make their excuses for why the game failed ie they'll say that it failed because it was released at the end of the Nintendo 64's lifespan and required an add on to work, etc.Yet the truth of the matter is the game failed because it was a different game altogether than a Legend Of Zelda game.It was a completely different game that simply featured Link, the setting was uninspiring and the NPC's were bad as is typical of Aonuma Zelda games.The Nintendo fanboy excuses for why Majora's Mask failed don't hold water because a truly epic game, a game that creates a phenomenon like the original Super Mario Brothers, Halo or Ocarina Of Time for example...it wouldn't matter if such games were released at the end of a console's lifespan, or if they needed an add on or both, fans would move both heaven and earth to secure their copy and get whatever add on they needed to be able to play it.Thats the kind of motivating power true gaming phenomenon's possess and Majora's Mask just didn't have it because it wasn't the game the true Zelda fanbase were looking for at the time which was a true genuine sequel to Ocarina Of Time.People argue and even Nintendo says that Majora's Mask was a sequel to Ocarina Of Time as it used child Link from Ocarina Of Time but these damage controllists and Nintendo simply do not get it, get what people wanted out of a sequel to a game like Ocarina Of Time.We wanted a game that continued the sandbox/open world exploration of Hyrule and it's themes and lore, a non linear game world featuring Hyrule's forests, fields and rivers, lakes and lost woods, Ganon, Zelda, Gorons and the whole nine yards of what the true Zelda experience entails, just even more epic than Ocarina Of Time's experience was due to the idea that Nintendo would learn something about creating midieval sword and sorcery fantasy adventure epics that feel so good to play they are damn near like having a religious experience and we'd think they'd of learned as much from having made Ocarina Of Time, Link To The Past and even the very first Zelda game on the NES but NOOOOO!!!!Nintendo had to put Aonuma in charge of Zelda instead of who they should have that being Kozuimi and because of that this effeminate geek/dweeb non entity hack Jimmy Fallon of Japan, pretentious, egg headed, left brained high IQ beta male whose never gone on an adventure or taken any big risks in life who can't identify with regular everyday normal people has just got to prove his worth and show us just how ""creative"" he can be by using the Legend Of Zelda IP to vomit out his second modern art/art house flop disaster Major Embarassment...oops I meant Majora's Mask...(or did I?)And the result just like his first game ""Marvelous"" was a sales flop.NO SURPRISE THERE!Anyway Ocarina Of Time fans wanted Nintendo to take things to the next level instead of giving us garbage like the world of Termina and it's boring circular field and its incredibly boring and lame Clock town and a boring goofy looking totally non threatening moon overhead and a closet homosexual manchild named Tingle to mock true Zelda fans with as Kojima mocked Metal Gear Solid fans in a similar but far less offensive way with Raiden.Nintendo please for sanity's sake fire this guy already or if you can't bring yourself to firing Eiji Aonuma at least switch his role in the company to something that'd be more befitting his skill-set which in other words means he should be cleaning the corporate toilets or bringing donuts and coffee to people, if not rice and octupus (whatever corporate types in Japan prefer for breakfast).",The game that proved beyond a shadow of a

I'd say the shooting game was the most fun for me--the ping pong had the potential but the controls were a bit awkward and even once I got the hang of it I couldn't find anyone who wanted to play that could control the darn thing well.  The tank game is okay, the fishing game is okay, the pool game feels awkward with the way you move the remote...I could go on, but the point here is that these games just aren't that much fun.  Even with the few amusing minutes I had when I first put the game in I've found the replay value here to be pretty low, and haven't played the game since that first time.Now the big question: is it worth the money?  Well, if I had it to do over again I'd just buy the Wii remote and save the 10 bucks, but I guess if you're looking for some simple games that let you use the Wii remote in various ways this game might provide that.  Just don't expect great amounts of entertainment.","I'm not impressed, but you get what you pay for"
37747,Nintendo,1,"to sum this up, the games are more boring than the wii sports. its just a updated wii sports. wii sports is fun to a degree but this is bad. the wii remote is nice, but thats all you will ever use out of the box. so just buy the remote for 40 bucks and save the 10 extra dollars.",50 bucks for a wii mote
37774,Nintendo,1,"Many people are going nuts over Wii Play.It comes with a Wii Remote!Woopdeedoo.Put the Wii Remote aside and you have a 10$ game.  It is definately not worth buying.  Only one fun game exists on the disk, and that is the shooting range.  The rest of the game is quite terrible.  It is better to just buy a lone Wii Remote.  I do believe that Wii Play should only cost 45$, because I frankly don't believe that the game is worth 10$.  If you are looking for mini-games, you should probably get Mario Party 8 or Wario Ware: Smooth Moves.",Horrible
37777,Nintendo,2,"After playing sports resort where the games are a lot more fun and graphics more presentable, wii play just isn't up to par. I bought this because I needed another remote and since a remote costs $36 (nintendo) or $30 (nyko), I guess to pay a little more for a remote + game may be a better deal. Like many other reviewers have said, it's like a buying a remote for $30 and $10 for the game.However, not all the games are bad. I like the pool game. The shooting game is simple but passable. The cow game is also fun but pretty much for young kids. The tank game is ok. The rest is just plain silly.So if you need another remote, go ahead and get this. Otherwise pass on the games. Better off getting sports resort.",Only if you need another remote
37785,Nintendo,2,"I would not recommend this game to anyone. If you have a Wii, then you most likely have Wii Sports. Thats all you really need for wii/mii fun. Only about 3 games in the bunch are playable in wii play, let alone fun, and the fun ones lose their luster within five minutes. You want a lot of shallow minigames done right? get warioware for the same price. The games are just as deep (but there are over 200 of them). With that game, you dont need the extra controller to play with friends. Its just that wii play games are so increadably shallow and quick that you will see all there is to offer in less then an hour. The only game that might keep your attention longer than that is tanks, but even that loses fun after an afternoon. The only reason this gets two stars is that it comes with a controller, but honestly, you are better off just buying a controller and passing on the game and saving your $10 for a movie or something that will keep your interest longer then 5 minutes. i know 10 dollars sounds like a little, but if someone comes up to you with a steaming pile of fresh, soft-serve dog droppings and says its only five dollars when the rest of the doo-doo he sells is $15, would you buy it just because it is a deal? Nobody needs this game, therefore nobody should buy it just because it is cheap.",Waste of time
37788,Nintendo,2,"A remote is a remote, but the wii play game is so bad, that I would not drop $10 on it again.  Get a $40 wiimote and save the $10 for a better game, like a cheap Wario or Rayman game.  Wii Sport is 3x as good as this 9 set of games.  While the physic isn't bad, the execution is lame and you lose interest within a hour.Save your $10 and just get a remote by itself.",Not worth $10

37829,Nintendo,2,I got this a while ago so i would have four remotes. I thought it would be a good deal because its only ten dollars more than a remote. But i should have just bought a remote because the game that comes with it is not very good. Its only mini games that is not even worth eight bucks. It does not even save it after u beat it. U have to beat it over and over again which it is kind of a hard game so its gets really boring. Even on multiplayer. The only good thing about this is the remote that comes with it.,Not worth getting.
37830,Nintendo,2,"We only bought this because (at the time) it was the same price for the Wii Remote as it was to get the Wii remote with Wii Play. I was stunned at how terrible the games were, and my expectations were not high to begin with after reading the other reviews. For example, comparing Wii Sports Tennis to Wii Play Table Tennis is night and day. The Wii Sports Tennis actually requires you to swing your arm, you can do a backhand stroke, and real effort is required. Wii Play Table Tennis on the other hand just requires that you slightly move the remote left or right to hit the ball. There are not actual swings and often your movements won't register, or won't register accurately. I found this to be consistently a problem throughout all of the games in Wii Play. My eight year old daughter does enjoy the fishing game, but the rest of them just didn't get played after a couple of days because they really are that bad.I did give it three stars though because the game included aWii Remote Controllerand that was our primary reason for purchase. TheWii Nunchuk Controller - White, is not included with this.",Worst game I've ever played on the Wii
37851,Nintendo,2,"I absolutely despise this game. What's the point? At least Wii sports has normal controls. The controls on this are TERRIBLE. A couple of the games are completely for toddlers. The other games like ping pong is ridiculous, the controls on it are terrible and the pool is idiotic w/ terrible controls also. Just for the heck of it, we tried EVERY game, so I know i'm being fair right now and we decided that we're never again putting this disc into my Wii... there is NO point!!! If you have normal games like Mario & Sonic at the Olympics, w/ good graphics, good controls and a lot of depth, why waste your time on this?I have this 2 stars because it comes w/ the extra remote. I suggest you buy the remote w/o this Wii Play nonsense. Also don't fall for the tricks of sellers everywhere who are writing 14 games... no no no 5 games on Wii Sports disc that comes standard w/ the console and 9 crappy mini games on this Wii Play. Everything about this game pissed me off, the controls and graphics and the games are not at all engaging and you never want to play them again. Unless of course you're a super casual gamer who doesn't care for playing a REAL game. Get Winter Sports or Mario & Sonic at the Olympics... those are REAL games that you and friends will have fun with.Overall, they just wanted to price the remote a little bit more so they stuck this little disc in, so you'd pay an extra 10 bucks for it! Not worth it. I wouldn't even pay a dollar for this game.","Completely pointless cheap games, remote is the only good thing"
37861,Nintendo,2,"Wii Play is a pretty big disappointment, especially considering how much fun Wii Sports is. Skip this game and get Wii Sports Resort instead.

Also a lot of the time you need to go to random places to advance the story, example (SPOILER ALERT) at ch 3 you know you are supposed to return a doll to the little girl, but when you go to her room the door doesn't open, well that's because you are supposed to solve this other unrelated puzzle first (the fountain pen) to advance the story, THEN you can go talk to the girl, which makes absolutely no sense.

    Nintendo",2,"I was so happy when I heard about ""Mario Party 8"", but I was so dissapointed when I played it. There are so many things WRONG with this game.First of all, this game should have been released for the Gamecube, not Wii. As a matter of fact, the whole game looks like it was completed for Gamecube, then quickly converted to Wii. Let's take when characters shop. The ""Yes"" and ""No"" options are at the bottom of screen. So usually when you point the controller so far down, the sensor bar looses contact with the control, so you have the ""re-aim"" the control several times. This was the design of the previos Gamecube games, but then you could just steer the controlstick and hit ""A"", here you have to aim and choose. This is annoying and frustrating, why couldn't they move the Yes or No to the middle of the screen?! I mean, when you choose what you want to buy, you have three things on the middle of the screen. Then when you've chosen what you want to buy, the options move to the bottom of the screen again - to ask you ""Are you sure you want to buy this?"" - ARGH!!! This was the design of Mario Party 6 and 7, so it's obvious this game WAS done for Gamecube first, then quickly converted. The same problem occours when that character with the hat asks if you want to hear a secret about the board you play, you have to AIM for ""no"".The minigames also suffers from the quick conversion. A lot of the minigames, you just turn the control to the side, use the plus for steering and 1 to kick/hit and 2 to jump. This is Wii, you'd expect to use the control like in other Wii games, not pretend the control is a Gamecube control!! And those games that use this control are so boring. Other games where you are supposed to steer, you ""tilt"" the controller either left or right. And some other games you turn the control, while it's up, from side to side. Why does the controls have to change so much?? Sometimes it's difficult to get contact with the sensor bar, even when you hold the control like you're supposed to. Take the game with the chimps, the game tells you to steer left or right to move the monkey. The game responds so bad, whether you move the control fast or slow, the chimp takes 2-3 seconds to respond. Bad conversion.There are a very few games which really feel like you play on Wii, like the ""Shaking Soda can"" minigame, or the ""Clean Chomp"" game. There's also a game where you should do 3 different things - saw, hammer and paint a wall. These games are easy and may seem boring, but they are funniest because you get to do something with the Wii remote, it feels like you are really playing. But believe me, the boring minigames are overload and they are regurlarly chosen instead of the fun minigames. I also felt the ""Battle Minigames"" were all boring, one game is impossible to be the only winner, because there's a limit on how much points you can get. And I HATE the cutting ropes game. It's totally random and I've never won it.It gets worse. In previous Mario Party games, especially in the first Mario Party, the easy computer players were so bad you were laughing at how badly they played certain games. I remember in the first game, I was laughing so hard watching Luigi play a memory game, he would run to the correct place, but then change direction and go to another place, then another, and another and choose wrong. Talk about stupid! In this game, I felt the easy players weren't easy, they play rather good for being supposed to suck at the game. So because they are easy, they play good at a slow speed or if the games requires a certain distance, they fail at certain distances. In previous games, easy computers was a laugh, here they appear really good.Anyway, let's say you play a game with a friend, you are forced to use 2 computers. You use them on easy, they never win a single minigame. That would make you a winner right? Wrong. This game is purely luck and walking fast. The computer players always hit 5-10, they land on all the bonus places and they can get 20-50 coins on a single turn. There is also a secret star area, when you hit a golden space, you get transported there. Me and a family member played this game, Toad was a computer player. Within 2 turns, he had already gone to the secret area. Then he went there TWO TIMES MORE. And yourself usually get to the secret area 1 out of 5 times playing a whole board game. So at the end, he got over 6 stars within 5 turns. That's just impossible to prevent, there is no chance time and duel only let's you steal 1-20 coins (I've only seen stars as a choice twice). So basically, the computer players never win a single minigame, but are so lucky they get coins and stars all the time.It gets EVEN worse. The boards feel uncreative and slow. The only way you get starts if you are quick enough, that means hitting 5-10 all the time. This what the computer players do. This is not what you do. Yourself get 1-4, if you're really lucky you get 10. I mean, sometimes I get 1 several times in a row and the computer player is almost at the star. To sum all the boards upDonkey Kong: Star is far away, so get there quicklyGoomba: Star is very far away, it's also free, so you just gotta get there quickly.Shy Guy Train: Star is far away, costs 10 (or 20?), get there Q U I C K L YKoopa Town: Only board worth it, you put money into hotels to be the owner. You don't need to be quick here.Boo's Mansion: Get QIUCKLY to Boo to get a star for 10 coins.It's all about walking fast, since you get so much money from bonuses, you don't NEED the minigame money. Basically, I can have 70 coins, but I only hit 1-3, then I don't have much to use the coins for, because I can't buy stars or candy if I don't QUICKLY get there.The 1 player Star Battle was pure torture, it was all about luck to win against the computer players.Another problem with this game is that there is a lot of dialogue and scenes you can't skip. Especially when the last 5 turns are announced, I button mash the A button like crazy, but each text box takes 1-2 to get rid of. Then it takes 1-3 seconds to show each player, then MORE dialogue. It takes 1-2 minutes just to get through this scene.And on the board, especially when you walk on the golden space, sometimes you need to be transported. You sit in a car and get driven to the place you need to go. It takes like 30 seconds to a minute to get there. And you CANNOT skip it. This slows the game down so bad!This game is only fun when you play with 3 friends, and even then the game can be boring. You can only win this game is you are lucky. Out of 20 times playing, I've won 2 times. I just don't bother doing my best anymore, because I know I'm going to loose anyway, just because I'm so unlucky in this game.One last warning, do not buy the thing that allows you to tease your opponents in the ""Fun Zone"". You CANNOT turn this off, so everytime you move your control the characters starts making the same sounds over and over. Even if you just move the control to put the control somewhere, the characters starts talking. For example, Peach can say ""I am the princess"" and ""Bleeeh!"". She says ""I am the princess"" 1 time out of 50. So when you move the control, just slightly, she goes ""Bleeh!"".""Bleh!"", ""Bleh!"", ""bleh!"". It's beyond irritating!",Only lucky players win

    Nintendo",2,"Mario Party 8 is essentially a collection of  (mediocre at best) mini games designed for the Nintendo Wii and the Motion Sensing Wii-Remote. What makes Mario Party unique is that it takes the form of a traditional board game, with players taking turns to roll the dice block and move ahead the number of spaces shown. The virtual game board has many different types of spaces players can land on, each producing different effects. The primary objective of the game is to collect more stars than the other players. The winner of the game is the player with the most stars after all the turns have been completed.As with most other party games, Mario Party 8 is best played with multiple, preferably four friends. However, the game can also be played alone or with less then four people, in this case the computer takes over for any absent player.Unfortunately, the game is not very engaging, making only limited use of the Wii-mote and moves painfully slow. This becomes a real big issue when playing the game as a single Player. In this situation the player is forced to sit and watch until all three computer controlled characters finish taking their turn. Overall, the game relays heavily on luck, which becomes frustrating especially when playing against the computer. Adding these shortcomings to the mediocre and often boring mini games makes Mario Party 8 a very unattractive game.",Mario's Wii Party fails to Entertain

Even worst is that the computers in the game roll straight 10's or they land on event buttons time after time, even on easy.

    Nintendo",2,"NOT WIDESCREEN! I've played every Mario Party. I've enjoyed them up until about 5. That's when they started making big mistakes. This is the worst Mario Party yet. I'll explain why.First, and most obvious, is the HDTV problem. This game is not in 16:9 widescreen at all. It fools you at first. The first screen and the menu is in full wide screen but the actual game and the mini-games are all in 4:3 format with horrible patterned borders on each side. A very cheap and annoying ploy by Nintendo. The graphics look great, but then when you start playing, it looks worse than Gamecube.TIP: Change your settings to 4:3 instead of 16:9 on a widescreen TV. Then just change your aspect ratio. This will give you the same game but without the annoying bars. You can still have it in 480p, it just won't be 16:9.Next is the controls. They are very far from imaginative. It's basically simplified WarioWare. You do very simple tasks to complete a mini-game and most of them are boring and dumb. Some games require movements with the remote that just don't work most of the time. You'll find yourself failing right away most of the time just because of the controls.Now we have the game boards. They are completely different this time. It's basically a race to see who can roll the biggest numbers. They give coins away like crazy so winning mini-games is almost worthless. I finished one game against the computer on easy and we all had 5 stars. Dumb. I won all the mini-games, yet the computer always had over 50 coins. Most of the boards are stupid and cheap and will just make you mad.Then we have single player mode. This is way different from party mode but you have to play it to unlock some stuff. The only problem, it's unfair. You play against the computer and they constantly get perfect rolls, tons of money, and tons of candy. I have yet to win the first match after 3 attempts.The game is unfair, barely fun, annoying, and has tons wrong with it. I was really close to just getting it from gamefly but I love Mario Party so I bought it. If you really want to play it, put it on your list. It's not worth the money in the same way Cooking Mama isn't. For the most part, it doesn't even seem finished.If you liked Mario Party 6 or 7, you'll feel let down by this one.

    Nintendo",2,"I'm sorry to say, but this has got to be the least fun pokemon game i've ever played.  After I get through the bad stuff tho, I will list some good stuff.  So don't skip this review.The game is fun, but, personally I think the online aspect ruins it.  You can get all sorts of stuff through trading that you usually won't be able to get too easily, and I find that a tad annoying.  Plus, The dialogue is terrible.  It's gotten extremely cheesy and at points i was shocked at how bad it is.  The bad guy team in this game was also really annoying, and the fact that half the members of it didn't seem to have a clue what was going on didn't help.  Theres also many new terrain types which are no fun at all, such as snow, fog, and swamps.  Fog you can't see a darn thing when you're walking around, and the only way to clear it is to use an HM move.  I don't like to have to remove my good attacks to put really weak HM attacks on my pokemon just to get further in the game, and this game seems to really emphasize HM's.The pokemon gyms have also turned into giant puzzles which take quite some time to figure out at times.  While this is probably welcome for most people as it adds a new level of gameplay, I personally prefer the walk in the room and beat up the leader approach of older games gyms.But what really killed it for me is the lack of stuff to do after you beat the game.  I love being able to continue playing a game after I beat it, and most pokemon games (especially gold and silver) have stuff to do afterwards.  Pokemon Diamond and Pearl do have stuff, but it is incredibly boring.  I continued playing for about 3 days after I beat it, and got bored and stopped.  I managed to get over 100 hours of gameplay out of pokemon ruby after i beat the elite 4.  (i had about 180 hours of gameplay before I started over, and it probably took 50 or less to beat the story mode)If you don't mind this lack of fun after you beat the game, then by all means get it.  And if the ability to get almost anything in the game online appeals to you, then, you should probably already have this game.

I'm not bashing their name for nothing, I'll list you all the reasons why this idea is indeed based on something.Slap a new name on an old game. Pokemon diamond is almost the same old game as when it first came out. Being on the new DS, you would expect it to at least upgrade its graphics and utilize the DS's full potential more.

Nintendo ran out of ideas for pokemons decades ago so they go into the pictorial dictionary of our earthly creatures and make a caricature of it and slap a goofy name that sometimes relate to the animals real life nature or...not..and call it a pokemon. They are so desperate to make up more pokemons that they brought in everything from dinosaurs to petshop animals to mystical creatures like dragons. Its to the point where its almost ridiculous to look at.Pokemon in this game seem to attack you a lot more, probably also based on ur abilities. Playing this game would drive you completely NUTS if you didn't carry a lot of REPELS, which seems to be the only real thing that works to repel those obnoxious wild pokemons. Sometimes you can take 2 steps and get attacked. Think about it, you're trying to solve a clue to get your way out of a cave and you get randomly attacked every 2-10 steps that you take. Just take a minute out of ur day and think of that for a second and see how you'll feel. Buy some insurance for your DS because I almost broke mines.I know cheating is bad but this game literally begs you to buy an ACTION REPLAY or other cheat device. Why? Because through half of the game they keep having you encounter the same small variety of pokemons. Catch'em all they say? How can you if 90% of the DIFFERENT types of pokemons almost throughout the game belong to a trainer?!?! You can set up your team however you want, but that's really limiting when you can only catch a handful of pokemon, especially old pokemon from the first game, even through half way in the game?! What is really fun is to be able to raise a pokemon throughout the game. Why would I want to find a legendary pokemon at lvl 50 when I'm practically done with the game?What I really really hate is how nintendo gives you a lot of pokemon like machop, gasley, abra in the beginning. They're nice but they can only evolve to their final form by trading. That is sort of hard, I'm 22 and I don't feel comfortable walking up to a little kid and be like ""hey do you want to trade pokemons with me?"" this is when a cop arrests me and I become a sex offender. I'm not crazy enough to play this online either.2. DS Utilization: Okay, the DS has a much better graphics engine on it, so why not use it? Pokemon Diamond could have easily been done on the regular gameboy. Use of the stylus? It's okay but nothing extraordinary. Sometimes its almost more convinient just using the buttons. Don't expect a lot of interaction using the stylus, its very badly incorporated into the game, to the bare minimum almost.Graphics remain pretty much 2D. For those of you that say DON'T FIX WHAT'S NOT BROKEN, that's the kind of attitude that makes you sink lower back to the caveman era. Don't fix it, IMPROVE IT.3. MISSIONS and PLOTS: SAME O SAME O. Old game with a new name indeed. Missions are basically the same, start in a town, objective to be the best, go beat gym leaders, beat the elite four, then battle tower etc afterwards.The bad guys are back, only difference is their name. Everything is EXACTLY THE SAME. Same with your rival. If you were starting to get sick of pokemon emerald....this is almost the exact version so pick one and keep it.4. Battling System: EXACTLY THE FREAKEN SAME. NINTENDO, if you were going ot make the exact game and change it a little bit to trick a bunch of kids to buying your game and making you a lot of money, at least make the pokemon's moves look a lot cooler. The moves have a little more graphics in them but HARDLY anything worth mentioning.THIS IS WHY I THINK IF YOU BOUGHT THIS GAME AND YOU'VE PLAYED POKEMON BEFORE, YOU'VE BEEN RIPPED OFF REAL BAD. WHAT NINTENDO IS DOING IS WHAT THE MOVIE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN DOING FOR A LONG TIME AS WELL. ADD A LITTLE STUFF, ADD A LITTLE SUSPENSE ON THE RELEASE, SLAP ON A NEW NAME AND BOOM, GULLIBLE HUMANS EATING YOUR TRASH.Get a flashcart everyone! You can put all your games on a memory card and play it on ur ds. Saves you lots of money!This is the only thing I can think of now but I'm pretty sure there's more complaints to be said. Oh yeah, you can't trade in your pokemon from your other pokemon games until much later when its almost useless.Be prepared to be pissed off when your pokemon that has a 165 based attack power and is 10 levels above a wild pokemon and still can't KO it with earthquake and its a normal effective move. THat's how ridiculous it is, and that pokemon has a 70 base def too...RIPP OFF!!!","Have You Bought This? If You Have, You've Been CONNED"

    Nintendo",2,"I have not played an Super Mario Paper games and this is the first Mario game I have played on the Wii.  I did not buy the game, I rented it instead.Pros:Intergration of Wii remote functions:  The Wii controller is held sideways to simulate playing an old school Mario game but there are some twists involved.  For example, when using certain power-ups, you would have to change the position of the Wii remote to match what is onscreen.  The rumble function of the remote is used during various times of the game and adds a little, but not much fun to the gameplay.  You can point the remote at the tv to access important information about characters and objects.  Also, when the remote is pointed at the TV hidden objects can be found.Graphics: Several people have give the game a low rating because of the graphic but I find the game graphics comparable to a well done cartoon.  Although the graphics are not like the graphics of a PS3 or XBox 360 I still consider them better than that of similar games on a PS2.Difficulty:  The gameplay is pretty easy and the puzzles are easy to figure out most of the time.  If you can't figure out the puzzles, there are ways to get ingame hints.  Although I did not buy the guide, it may help some players outOfficial Nintendo Super Paper Mario Player's Guide.  The difficulty is appropiate for the ratings.Gamplay Options:  Mario can switch from a 2D to a 3D world.  Although some may complain about the time limit, I think the time limit works because it adds more difficulty to the game.  The ability to switch between characters adds variation to the game so one person does not always have to play Mario.Cons:Storyline:  For an RPG, the storyline is awful.  There is too much meaningless chit chat going on in the game that does not add any value to gameplay.  Although there are save points, there are times when you have to go through the same chit chat over and over again if you die.  I do not see the story appealing to anyone, not even little kids.  There is a lot to explore in the worlds but because of the dialogue, I just wanted to finish the game as soon as possible.Pointless Puzzles:  There are two that stuck out in my head.  The first one being having Mario hit a block or run in a hamster wheel for rubbies.  This takes no skill and was the most boring part of the game.  The second one being Mario go through 20 fighting rounds where it only takes one hit to kill the bad guys and then going through a bunch of doors to find the end of the level.  I would have rather had 3 rounds with more difficult opponents.Although I have listed more Pros than Cons, the weight on the cons is greater than the weight on the pro which is why I game the game 2 stars.  The Cons really do take away the enjoyability of the game.  I think Nintendo should make a sequal to this game and remove some of the unnecessary dialogue and puzzles.",Complete Failure

    Nintendo",1,"Wow, what an utter dud ""Pokemon Battle Revolution"" is. I cannot stress enough the embarrassment that Nintendo SHOULD feel at the completely lackluster presentation, or the monotonous single player mode. And while it is fun to play online, I can already do that in the Diamond that I own. But anyway, let's beginThe Good:1) Graphics - it IS fun to see all 493 Pokemon illustrated in this game (or at least 490, although I think Darkrai, Shaymin and Arceus are there as well). The 3-D graphics are cute (though hardly spectacular), although they are so similar to the designs in ""Pokemon:XD"" to warrant exceptional praise. I would have at least hoped that the characters would be more sharp than their GC predecessors. Nonetheless, the Pokemon are colorful.The Bad:1) Gameplay - Boring. Monotonous. Ultimately pointless. The one-player game is one of the most painful gameplay experiences I've endured, and I've played ""Alundra 2"". The fact is, the developers spent about five minutes actually thinking of this game.2) Voices - Annoying. The announcer says the exact same thing after each attack. Come on, now.3) In-game extras - OK, I'm happy that I can get a Magmortar and an Electavire (but only after entering a special code - you don't even unlock them through the game), and they even have the correct natures. And yeah, a Pikachu that knows surf is kind of nice (hearkening back to the days of ""Pokemon Stadium""), but let's get real. ""Pokemon Stadium 2"" let me play fun little minigames with my friends, and let me play the DS on the TV. Would that REALLY have been that hard to introduce here? The fact is, this games' extras blow chunks. Seriously. You can beat all of the trainers, and guess what? You get to fight them again! Hooray.4) Rental pokemon - Are you kidding? In ""Stadium,"" I could rent pretty much ANYONE (including Mew), and similarly for 'Stadium 2"". Here? I get one of the WORST starter sets imaginable, and I actually have to win with these losers to get other cards unlocked. The fact is, this game is nigh unplayable without your own copy of ""Diamond"" or ""Pearl"". Even then, it stinks, but don't even think of believing that this game can even REMOTELY stand alone.It should be clear. This game is terrible.",What a joke...

I didn't even know that until after I beat them all. I was excited for this game, and when I got it, I had fun. But since I didn't have any of the DS games at the time it was truly disappointing, and the game was basically useless. Except for looking at the pretty graphics and playing over Wi-Fi connection.

My original expectations were a bit too high.  While this browser is slow, the design is better than I orignally gave it credit for.  So if you are looking for a browser that is quite functional and are not in too big a hurry, then this is certainly worth the money. I am happy I got it.  Just wish it could be a little faster.I had really high hopes for this browser, especially since it was out months ago in Europe so I thought any weaknesses would have been fixed. Unfortunately that is not the case. It is very slow, poorly designed and has problems with the touch screen working. It is ok to browse if you have no other way of browsing, but overall is more of a pain to use than is worth it. I truly hope they have the ability to download patches to make this browser work even moderately better. Really surprised since the Opera Wii browser is awesome and the big reason I bought a second Wii. This one feels like it is only 30% complete.

I bought this so I can work on getting my brain back into shape.  When I say a disappointment I meant it. First of all, you must know how to play Paper, Rock Scissors, I do not know that game, I am from Brooklyn I recall something like eenie meanie?Well since  I do not know how to play that game to get me brain age I had to cheat. I wrote down what the game is and copy it.  Then the games or assignments are the same thing over and over.I have them memorized, it does not take a rocket scientist to see that the jumble words always start with Crew, then Flash etc.  they are always the same.  How do  you learn something if that something never changes?The guy is a pain in the neck, every time you start a game over you have to go passed all the pages of his nonsense before you can start to play again and he is so cheesy. what do these people think we are children?

    Nintendo",2,"From the previous chapter of Fire Emblem: This has taken a turn for the worst.The Storyline was way too-divided between '2 main characters' instead of one. On top of that, there seems to have been a drastic change in some of the character's relationships as well as just the overall theme and tone of the story.It would be okay to me if they just introduced new characters to add-on to the previous installment of Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, but for some odd reason that didn't happen.This game is harder than the Path of Radiance, however they changed too much of the game's mechanics in this one to the point where veterans would have to learn a whole new game - and that's not very fun. In addition, the ""supposedly"" transition of the data-file from Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance was negligible. Basically your heroes' stats would only be affects if they were a maxed level unit. (a level 20 promoted unit).They attempted to balance the Weapons Triangle so fiercely that I believe they took away the uniqueness of what each class is 'intended' for. For example, they would allow ranged weapons for every class now: Swordsmen, axe-wielders, and lancers that there just seems to be an overlap against mages and archers. They made it so that every-class was basically a generic-bland.Of course I'm making a biased review because I didn't like the ending.Replay Value: 3/10. After you beat the game, you will be given the option to start ""A new game plus."" Although you may be able to make some slight differences of the outcomes, ultimately the ending is the same. It kind of defeats the purpose of re-playing the game.",I don't like it.

    Nintendo",2,"It is non-stop 5 star reviews for this game, but for me, there was just not enough customization or replayability.Personally, I love SRPGS, Advanced Wars, Dynasty Tactics, Xcom, played them all.  Recently, a batch of great SRPG games came out, Jeanne D'Arc, FF Tactics, Disgaea on the PSP, all 3 had it's specialty.Fire Emblem - Don't see what all the hype and rave reviews are about.  After just 1 week, I've already put this down to play Disgaea, it's far more fun.Characters - too many, so many that you do not feel attached to them, and many of them are unbalanced.  Which means some are crucial to the gameplay, some it's better to just leave them or let them die.Customization - There is none, each character has specific powers.  You select a weapon, but there is nothing else you can customize, no armor, nothing.  Yes, there is the relationship build up and skill, but it's stil lacking.Story itself - This is not bad, it's worth taking the time to read thru the text.  Though by this generation systems, you expect a little more graphical power or design flair, it's a tad bit boring presentation.How to generate funds / bonus items -  It's done thru fixed talks with NPCs.  There's no point to read thru those text, just click + and skip to the end and receive the funds or item.  IMHO, this is done poorly.Gameplay - Some characters are absolutely critital if you want to advance thru the harder levels.  It's easy to get killed, and I think most of us would like to keep all charactere alive.  To do so, you will need to reload the game A LOT.  Here's the problem, there is NO LOAD GAME option, you have to quit to Wii menu and start over.  This alone makes the whole process painful.Overall - If this game came out at the beginning of the year where there was absolutly no SRPG games, then it would be a solid 5 star.  Just in these few month, you get 3 awesome tactics games:  Jeanne D'Arc, FF Tactics, Disgaea, Fire Emblem just doesn't hold it's own.  If you don't have a PSP and love SRPGs, then Fire Emblem is the definitely a good choice and only choice.  For sure I'll play it later when the SRPG games dry up, but for now, Disgaea is a far more fun.",Good only if you have played and enjoyed previous Fire Emblems

    Nintendo",2,"I played this game before its prequel: Path of Radiance for the Gamecube.In the beginning the story and characters seemed uninspiring, the dialogue wooden and juvenile. How could anyone care for the Dawn Brigade? Leonardo, Edward, Nolan, so shockingly poor characters do I seldom see. Also the whole presentation seemed flawed. Outdated graphics, unmemorable music, bad voice-acting, still pictures and lifeless images.Little by little I grew into the game, and after a while I was no longer bothered by the things which I mentioned. The story, characters and dialogue all improved as the game moved on, particularily in part III.A new to the series, the game felt immensely difficult at times, but it was mostly for not thinking ahead and trying to move too fast. On second playthrough even hard/maniac mode is a piece of cake.However, only after playing Path of Radiance, and then starting this game again, do I see how lackluster this game actually is.

    Nintendo",2,"I'm generally not a fan of PC style adventure games, which this basically is.  With all the great reviews though, I figured I'd give this a shot when I saw it on sale.I actually got a lot more enjoyment out of it than I was expecting.  The art style is generally charming.  The story (what I got of it) is fairly interesting.The puzzles range from very easy, to absurdly hard, though there's a general progression of easier to harder puzzles as the game progresses.  I found many of the puzzles fun, some annoying, but solvable, and a decent chunk either no fun at all, or impossible for me to figure out.The way the game is structured, one usually has the ability to skip puzzles that one is stuck on-but unfortunately not always.  I had to give up finally on a puzzle somewhere past the halfway mark.On a *very* ""nit-picky"" technical note, I did find the load time between screens a bit annoying as I progressed.  It's only a couple of seconds, but it adds up.Bottom line-if you're a fan of point and click adventures, or puzzles, you'll probably enjoy it.  If not, odds are you'll still have some fun with it, but you'd probably be better served buying something else (or buying it on sale).","More fun than I expected, though ultimately annoying"

    Nintendo",2,"It's a fun gimmick for about 10 minutes but then wears thin.  One of the Wii fit activities was jogging in place with the controller in your pocket, not even using the balance board, as you watch the bland scenery, ugly graphics, and annoying Mii's run with you.  Another was step aerobics.  An actual step DVD program would be more fun then this robotic and slow-paced step on, step off, step on, step right crap.  Graphics were bland and games weren't really that innovative in my opinion.I feel this is a fun little toy, (more or less an expensive scale) but overall, just another short-lived peripheral for the Wii, unless they can find some actual fun and innovative uses for it.  How many peripherals until we've had enough.  Anyone else tired of those Mii's yet, I know I am.",Another peripheral?!!?

    Nintendo",2,"Wii Fit, like all Nintendo Wii (and DS) products, is polished and immaculately presented. Its very approachable and friendly. The Balance Board is a tremendous piece of kit - rock solid and absolutely excellent at what its supposed to do.As a product dedicated to fitness, though, its pretty lacking. Now, don't get me wrong - it is far better than doing nothing (what I am used to doing), and actually has some nice perks to keep you going (like score tracking and an unlock mechanic). But it doesn't let you customize a workout, and progression advice is minimal. It literally just lets you do whatever activities at any time. Now, I could go to the gym and do exactly the same thing, but I still would want to get some advice from someone or something. Wii Fit doesn't do it!Another problem is that between activities, you have to stop and navigate menus. It'd be much better if there was a flowchart like menu for setting up workouts so you can go one after the other, keeping the heart rate up. This is a very serious deficiency and I wonder why Nintendo didn't put it in.All in all, as an introduction to fitness, its pretty good, and at $90 its really pretty affordable if you have a Wii already. but I really hope some other company comes out with a good fitness videogame using the balance board, with more workout and eating tips. That would really be a great thing.",Good as an introduction

    Nintendo",2,"Yeah, the Wii Fit is fun and motivational.  However, there are certain things about it that make me wonder if it's really helpful in the long run.  We've had it for 217 days now and here are the quirks I notice:1.  It asks you the weight of your clothing (estimated).  We all assumed that it took the amount you weighed and subtracted the estimated clothing weight to provide you with your weight for the day.  However, I recently started occasionally weighing myself undressed.  Every time I do that (even though I do tell it my clothes weigh 0 lb) it tells me my weight is between 1.5 and 2.5 pounds less than the day before, when I wore clothing.  If the next day I weigh myself clothed and tell it my clothes are 2 lb, it tells me my weight is between 1.5 and 2.5 pounds higher than the day before, when I was undressed.  I really do not believe my weight is fluctuating by 1.5-2.5 pounds a day, so I don't entirely trust the Wii Fit weight calculations.2.  During the body test, some days I'm good, and some days I'm not.  Just like most people, I suspect.  But some days I will be consistently off-balance across the testing, AND fakely higher in weight (see #1 above), and yet my Wii Fit age is 7-10 years lower than my real age.  By contrast some days I ace all the balance tests and have appeared to ""lose weight"" and my Wii Fit age goes up alarmingly.  I'm 45.  One day my Wii Fit age was 93!  The very next day it was down to 35.  So I don't trust the Wii Fit age calculations.3.  This may be because our Wii Fit platform is calibrated wrongly, or because everyone in my family is unbalanced (ha ha), but we ALL seem to have our center of balance quite a bit further back than the cross hairs on the tests.  All three of us find ourselves leaning artificially forward in order to hit the cross hairs, instead of standing as we normally do.  When we stand normally, we're back near the bottom edge of the graph.  But the Wii Fit doesn't tell us this is a problem.  So, why have the cross hairs if it doesn't count?4.  During running exercises, if you don't have a pocket, you're supposed to hold the Wii remote while you run in place.  We have tried it both ways.  Holding the remote makes it jiggle more, and it results in a faster time for the person holding it.  Anyone who puts the remote in a pocket comes in far, far behind on the running games.  So we're not sure which is more accurate.  The remote-in-pocket might not get as much movement as a person running really would have; on the other hand, the remote-in-hand probably gets shaken more than a person running really would.So, we use it as a fun and general measurement of how we're doing but it's not part of a serious workout or monitoring regimen for us.",Dubious calculations

    Nintendo",2,"I recieved this game as a Christmas gift along with a Wii. Having never played the Wii before, I was excited to try out Endless Ocean, and was quickly bored and somewhat disapointed. I'm not saying Endless Ocean doesn't have good graphics, I just am in that small minority pool of people who quickly got tired of swimming around and petting the fish.I think, in my case, the problem is this: I live in Florida. I go scuba diving, boating, fishing. I've been on reef dives, explored sunken boats, swam alongside the coral, and been spearfishing a couple times. I just...well I had a hard time getting a thrill out of Endless Ocean, where I struggled at first to even float, then seemed to swim in circles and see the same fish when I finally went into other areas. I literally saw humerphead wrase about a hundred and fifty gazillion times.And then I sat on my fake boat, walked around it, went back down, pet some more fish...got bored, and went to do something else.Not that the fish in the endless ocean aren't sorta cool. You click on them to find out there names and info. The game just didn't keep me interested. I guess it was the lack of any real objective except swimming around an endless ocean that bored me. Maybe if a shark were to come up to eat me, accompanied by Jaws music, I would have played longer. At least when I go diving for real, there's always that fear! Endless Ocean made me sleepy in contrast.Hmm...well, just saying this game's not for everyone. Some people will get bored. Others will be fascinated. I've never been the sort of person to much enjoy many museums either, so this learning/sea exploration game wasn't my thing, but plenty will like this underwater game.",A bit boring....And I'm a scuba diver!

    Nintendo",2,I purchased this game primarily on the reviews which led me to believe I'd be getting a free-roaming scuba simulation with a little game tacked on.Really though that isn't the case. Your ability to free roam is limited to a small circular area of a few hundred square feet which you can't leave. If you want to roam further you have to move your boat which then moves the boundary to the new point. But to get the use of the boat you have to perform several tasks first - in fact to get use of several items you have to perform these tasks.Perhaps later in the game the boundary gets bigger - not sure. The mandatory 'teach your dolphin to somersault' sub-game turned me off so much I doubt I'll return.Very disappointed.,Not quite what I was expecting.

While it sold very well, it wasn't even close to touching the surface of what other traditional Pokemon games have done. Blue and Red Rescue Team weren't that exciting, they had boring gameplay, were incredibly repetitive and just all around bland. Sadly, Chunsoft didn't really do a whole lot to improve a severely flawed game. In fact, it suffers from many of the same problems as the other Mystery Dungeon games.Just like the previous one, you are a human that one day wakes up as a Pokemon. You get a partner based off the questions you answer at the beginning. Same basic principle as the first. Then you'll go on missions where you will hunt down outlaw Pokemon or rescue other Pokemon. It's simplistic stuff. The story actually isn't so bad. It's a very slow story, but for Pokemon you're actually getting something good. You won't see a trainer throughout the game. At all. This is all about the Pokemon.On the other hand, the story and flow of gameplay is repetitive. Seeing the same cutscene before and after each mission over and over and over again gets very annoying when you just want to jump into your next mission. However, it's easily the gameplay that's the worst part of the game.Just like the Rescue Team games, the gameplay is incredibly stale and boring. You go into a dungeon and explore floors that are randomly generated until you get to your objective. The floors are all very bland and boring. The biggest problem with the random generated floors is when you enter the next area and you're right next to the exit. It happens from time to time. Then again, most of it you'll want to get through quickly, anyway. The environments are so bland and devoid of details that one floor doesn't feel any different from another. It's like walking through an endless dungeon. They have their own themes, but no real design.The combat is worse. When you approach a Pokemon, you'll engage them. There are no random battles, but that doesn't mean it'll play like an Action RPG. At first glance, combat really doesn't seem all that bad until you realize there's no strategy involved whatsoever. What makes the traditional games addictive, other than catching them all, is the surprising amount of depth that goes into each battle. This is exactly what the Mystery Dungeon series lacks. It quickly becomes a button mashing affair with no real thought or strategy. The game is also unbelievably easy. Even boss battles are an easy, button mashing affair to see who can get in the most attacks. Even though you're given a set of moves you can use, and there's a little bit of strategy here, you'll find that you never actually need it. There's hardly an incentive to pick moves over another. You'll go exploring with a party of four, and you can control their moves as well, but mostly, you'll find you need just one Pokemon to get much of the job done. Combat is just boring.Much like the previous one, you can get wild Pokemon to join your rescue team. You can only have four in your party at a time, however, but nonetheless you can still get them to join.What would a Pokemon game be without two versions? With this duo you have Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness. Much like all the duo's, the games don't have that many differences, but you'll need both to uncover and unlock everything. This means you'll either have to buy the other version or convince a friend to do so. Should the worst ever happen and you actually get taken down in a dungeon, you can send out a distress signal in hopes that a friend will come by and rescue you. Unfortunately, you're probably better off accepting your fate.Pokemon has never been a game to push graphics and sound. Mystery Dungeon is no exception. It's a very colorful game, but hardly takes the DS to the standards it can accomplish. Much of it looks like it belongs on the Gameboy Advance rather than the DS. And with the boring design of the dungeons, there's really nothing here to look forward to in terms of graphics. As I said, however, Pokemon has never been a graphical powerhouse. It doesn't really sound great either. Much of the music is forgettable.If you enjoyed Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Blue Rescue Team or Red Rescue Team, then chances are you'll like this one as well. It's essentially the same game. So if you did like Blue and Red Rescue Team, then you can very much disregard this review. If Blue and Red Rescue didn't do much for you, don't expect the latest release to turn you into a fan.",Incredibly Boring

44316,Nintendo,1,"My grading scale with Wii Games looks like this ...5 star = A must play. No improvements need to be made. Has replay value (this is very important). I do not give out 5 star reviews open-heartedly. I consider any game worth playing, and owning is a 4 star game (which is my way of saying its 5 stars). Im very strict on 5 stars.4 star = Even if its my favorite game for the Wii, I will hand out 4 stars to it cause I can view some improvements to be made. OR it does not have replay value (meaning I played it once, I loved it but Im not gonna play it again). Either way, it was a game I would prefer over its competition / genre. I like to give any great game 4 stars just so I can leave some room for a potential 5 star future improvement of the game.3 star = Playable and fun game, I would recommend it but there may be a better alternative (a game that received a 4 star in the same genre)2 star = Not worth playing. No need to purchase. Much better games out there in the same genre.1 star = Silly game. A waste of time. No need to bother.And now we can continue with the actual review for Wii Sports ... First of all, I am a 24 year old male. I am not happy seeing a lot of 4 and 5 star reviews for this game. Its as if no other games were played therefore the reviewers had nothing to compare the game to. I can understand that as Wii Sports comes with a new Nintendo Wii. This is not a hot launch title like Super Mario 64 was for the N64. In no way should this game have the same review rating as Super Mario 64. I would give this game a 1.5 as it is 5 games in one but ratings need to be lowered! As to not fool anybody out there that this is a hot product, because it is NOT. I am one that relies on Amazon reviews for a lot of the products I buy. So I do not want to be misinformed. People who purchase the Nintendo Wii spend their time playing hot titles like Zelda, Super Mario Galaxy, Metroid Prime 3, Resident Evil 4, Mariokart Wii, etc. THIS GAME, ""Wii Sports"" can be seen left in its packaging unopened by a Wii owner. If I could sell this game I'd be happy. If you purchase a Wii that does not have Wii Sports, please purchase a different game. As I'm sure you can always borrow this from a friend. In fact, they may very well give it to you. I would.So lets look at this game ... The title of this review is ""too much intrinsic ratings"". What I mean by this is the high ratings are given to this game because it has a strong relationship with the Nintendo Wii console. Nintendo Wii is of great success (and even having this Wii Sports game included with it, I would still offer 5 stars to Nintendo Wii). But this individual game needs to be reviewed for the game that it is. And not a psychological view that 1) it is mutual with the Nintendo Wii (dont want to give a bad review to the game that piggybacks with a remarkable console), or 2) it is often the first game played on the Nintendo Wii. In fact being the most handed out game (how often are hand outs considered popular?) this game has only received less than 20 reviews. Maybe its because hardcore gamers have no interest in this game, or never bothered to play it. As I had no intention playing this game when I purchased my first Nintendo Wii.So lets look at what it offers ... these are all short games. Nothing competitive, or innovative. An introduction as other reviewers have mentioned. This is more like a demo. Or a tutorial for the real version of the games. And is very PONGY.Baseball ... only 3 innings. Cant play defense. Use no thought. You just pitch, and bat. While the computer plays the fielders. No double plays can be made, no pick-offs. I consider it an 80's baseball version of pong. It is very simplicit. What I mean by this is when you hit the ball, as soon as the fielder touches it, it will tell you whether you received a single, a double, or a triple. Can you imagine playing a baseball game on an 80's computer? Where it tells you what happens. Yes, like that. You dont tell the runners where to go or have ANY interaction with the fielders. Its very basic. Pitch the ball by swinging down. Then hit the ball by swinging across. And thats IT. Let the computer take care of the rest. No buttons need to be pushed in this game.Tennis ... this game reminded me when I was in Las Vegas. I played a game called ""Ace Tennis"" on one of those virtual game touch-screen machines at a bar. Again, its very simple, just swing the remote at the right time. Doesnt take any thought. The ball seems to always go over the net and land in the same spot everytime. You can do this with your eyes closed. And not to mention but when playing single player, you play on a team of two. I played best out of 5 games, and best out of 3 games, the player on my team NEVER hit the ball. He was just a stand in, I did all the work. The same was true on the opponents team, he just slid back and forth along the net, didnt do anything unless I hit a slow one just over the net. And he'll finally pong it back to me. I literally spent 5 minutes going back and forth with the tennis ball. Just same ol same ol. Opponent doesnt make mistakes (he did once though I'll admit so consider it rare).Boxing ... first day I got my Wii (I had no other games) I couldnt sleep that night. So I got up at 1:30am. Didnt have anything to do at the computer so I played Wii Sports. I had played Wii Sports for over an hour earlier that day to get used to the game. It was kind of fun at first cause you're learning the game and wondering if this really is that 4+ star game!! ... so I get up at 1:30am and I really didnt want to play it but I had no choice lol. I searched through the game TRYING to find a reason to like it but I couldnt. Boxing is probably my favorite sport here. I spent an hour boxing. It gets harder after each fight you win. Eventually after an hour you get frustrated cause you cant get any punches through and it tires you out. The controls are a little tricky too. Punches I wanted to do would rarely register (the low or side punches). You can literally win rounds with nothing but high punches (which is keeping the remotes in front of your head and swinging down as if you're beating a drum). That simple. But the only reason I liked the boxing is cause it was a nice workout for the arms. After an hour you will feel a light sweat, become a little tired, you feel the blood pumping through your arm. So boxing is something I can consider apart of a workout plan. But there could be a much better option like Wii Fit, or a more in-depth boxing game like Facebreaker for example. In fact the mini games on Rayman Raving Rabbids gave me a better workout when I was beating a drum listening to a song. It made me move my body as I rhythm'd to the beat.Golf ... frustrating. I'm not a golf fan myself. This isnt Tiger Woods here, you cant customize, or play in competitive championships. Im sure Carnival games: MiniGolf is a much better option. Brings you more into the game. This golf here is very basic. You hit the ball in the hole, try to make par, and then you do it again lol. Very ""pong-y""Bowling ... bowling was hard for me. I didnt really master it. I had fun when I first played. Though having been without a game console for 6 months I was quite eager to play a Nintendo Wii again so I was thrilled no matter what I played =)And that sums up my review. This is a very PONGY game, as in basic / beginner / tutorial / demo. Its not your top of the line sport game here. I really hope this isnt viewed as a remarkable game for the Wii. I think the future of gaming has yet to come, Nintendo Wii being apart of that future and this game is just not it. Its pong. And you sure dont want to spend $30? on this game. Wow. I think the market is overpriced on that. Especially with so many in production it will greatly drop in value with time. I personally might play this game again. As I mentioned, boxing is a light workout. And Tennis is a virtual game I played at a bar having some drinks. So I wouldnt mind re-living that memory. And thats about it. Dont give yourself high expectations for this game coming from an adult perspective. For your child, they'll find more fun to it but still better alternatives for them ===",Very PONGY game. Too many intrinsic ratings!

    Nintendo",1,"After playing most of this game, I really don't understand why there are so many positive reviews here. I'll admit that the good reviews and the cool cover art is what lead me to buy the game. Even when I read G4's negative review, I still thought perhaps this was one of those games that the bigshots reviewed negatively, but that was actually a good game. Sadly, I was mistaken. This game failed to bring much of anything to the table. It's all bad controls, bad gameplay, bad graphics. Just bad. And I normally wouldn't bring up graphics when it comes to gaming. I mean, graphics shouldn't count for a whole lot. But these are really bad. It almost feels like insult to injury in this case. Even being the advanced gamer that I am, I couldn't always tell where I was supposed to go or do. Maybe there are people out there who really do like this game. But I have a feeling that most of these reviews aren't real. I can't see how they could be. My advice? Skip this game.",Where are the positive reviews coming from?

The game play was easy but you had to do some out of this world maneuvering just to get some stuff and that should have been saved for the harder levels. Even though this is an old game from 2008 I really think Super Mario Bros wii sets the bar for ""fun-factor"" and remote ""sensitivity"" in videos games. I think this game was meant to be a big deal but got pushed through quality and into our laps.Pros: Nice Box art, cartoon-styled graphicsCons: The first levels are too hard to start off with, too many extreme manuevers , when you shake the wii remote to get coins the sensitivity is low causing you to shake the remote too hard.",4 stars? puhleeze

    Nintendo",2,"After seeing 10 reviews and this having a 5 star overall rating (9 five and 1 four), I couldn't resist picking this game up for under 20 bucks.I'm a 34 year old male who usually enjoys sports simulations, rpg, adventure, and puzzle and family games.It feels very much like the I Spy games or Hidden Mystery games on the PC. It contains very little story with very short interactions with the suspects.  You do virtually nothing to 'solve' the mystery other than find random items within a picture and solve some simple puzzles.  The items are completely random and don't even go along with the story or setting (ie: within the garden you find a bundle of junk the millionheir left there)Then to top things off, you suddenly have to perform some silly task before you can get information from a suspect (like fix a clock or find some ingredients for a recipe).  I thought I was supposed to be a detective.It had a few nice tools, like the usage of a flash light, x-ray pen, and straw (microphone) to blow things around the screen.Professor Laytons Curious Village was a mystery / puzzle game that was much better than this.  It's puzzles revolved more around logic and reasoning rather than seek and find.  Millionheir feels more like a word search with pictures (I would choose this over a word search) that have little to nothing to do with the plot.I skipped the rookie mode and chose detective mode (you are given a limited amount of time to find the clues within a picture).  I had at least half the time left for each picture except one.  I never felt rushed to hurry and solve the task at hand even without using the hint button.  Upon completion, you do get more difficult settings if you feel like replaying it again...but I don't have an interest in completing a game just to find different items within the pictures.Other reviewers call this a 'thinking' game, but I find there are much better 'thinking' games out there (Professor Layton, Flash Focus, Brain Age, most adventure games, most rpg games, and most strategy games).Based on the reviews, there is definitely a population that enjoys it, so be sure to read their reviews to see if you have similar interests as I seem to be in the minority and not the target audience for this game.The nice thing about this game is the price relative to most DS games, BUT I would have enjoyed reading 3 new mystery novels for the same price (10+ used mystery novels).","Repetitive, quick & easy, prefer reading a book"

But this game only has twelve suspects, with only two screens of objects for each with four or five objects to look for on each. I'll be finished with this game in no time. I haven't received the other two hidden object games yet from Amazon, and I hope they're not going to be as short as this one.","Very, very short game"

Now and then there are 'puzzles' but with only one exception, they are simple and require no real thought.If  you're looking for a ""Where's Waldo"" type of entertainment, I highly recommend this game.  The detail is astonishing, particularly in X-Ray mode. As a mystery, it misses the mark.","Great graphics, not very interesting"

    Nintendo",2,"I absolutely adored the first Animal Crossing game for the GameCube. I'd play it every single day for about 2 years, filling up my catalog, hunting for bugs, fishing, getting all the fossils, trading items with friends, etc. I even went the extra mile and got the E-Reader accessory just so I could get surprises from the Animal Crossing cards that were made. For me, Animal Crossing was easily one of the top 3 GameCube games, and I put it in my top 25 favorite games list not that long ago on here. Then...the DS game Wild World came out, and I just couldn't get into it. The 'rolling world' effect was annoying, there wasn't much new content that was fun, and I didn't care to get another copy when it got stolen. When City Folk here came out a few years ago, it didn't look much different from Wild World, and I noticed that Nintendo was very disappointed with sales for the game, even after they hyped the whole voice chat accessory for it. Well, I've recently given this game a chance, and it hurts me to say that I can have more fun with the original than this newer version, which I almost just called an upgrade, but it's anything bur that. But before I get started, if you're new to the Animal Crossing games, you can change my ratings to 4 stars for both fun and the overall rating, as it'll be fresh to you.City Folk plays exactly like the previous games, where you start your life in a new city full of talking animals, digging up fossils, catching fish and bugs to fill the town museum, helping people deliver items to one another, and take part in town events like fishing tournaments and even holidays. When you enter the city, you don't have any money, and run a few errands for Tom Nook, the local shop owner. He actually lets you live in one of the little houses nearby, but you'll be in debt, and need to pay it off in order to get a bigger house, and for him to get a bigger store. And that's the main part of the game, more or less, though the game really doesn't have any objectives that need to be met, and it never really 'ends'. You can see the credits on saturdays when K.K. Slider shows up to play music, and the credits play while he sings.On paper, the game sounds really boring, but it's fun and engaging, if you're new at least. There are many different kinds of fish and bugs to collect, with many only being available at certain times of the day and during certain months. Some bugs are incredibly fast, and can take some players years to catch if they're not quick enough. Fossils are dug up, identified at the museum, and if they don't have what you brought in yet, they'll take it and display the bones in the appropriate section. Of course, you don't have do donate fish, bugs, paintings or fossils- you can sell them to Tom Nook, trade them with other villagers if they ask for one, or just display them in your own home. Decorating your house is one of the more fun elements in the game, as Tom Nook only has a couple of items for sale each day that you can put in your home, with new stuff coming in all the time. You'll want to pay off that debt fast, and make your house bigger and bigger so you can make room for the cooler stuff, as you home barely qualifies for a shack when you start out. Wallpaper, carpet, beds, couches, dressers, ninja swords, ponds, bonsai trees, there are hundreds of things you can decorate your house with. Some items are themed, like the Lovely series which has a heart design with everything, or the Kiddie series which resembles an indoor play area for toddlers, complete with elephant slide. You can have up to 4 different people in the same town, and can send letters to one another along with items to help them out. It's pretty fun competing to see who can get the most things in the museum. There's also the online mode which is like the Wild World feature, but a bit smoother of course.I just made it sound like fun, but the thing is- I just basically repeated what I'd say for anyone playing the GameCube game, aside from the online play. There are barely any new features here that I can say anything good about, and then there's another problem- there just isn't that much to do. I remember talking to villagers in the original, and they'd almost always have something for me to deliver to another villager, or want me to buy something of theirs. In City Folk, I'd actually be surprised when a villager would have me run an errand, since most of the time they'd just spew some cute lines or ask me to change their catchphrase. Unless you have a lot of friends with the game that you can visit online, there's not going to be much to do aside from the usual fishing/bug hunting. But what about the City, the key feature here that's even mentioned in the game's name? Very disappointing. Gracie, the stylin' uppity giraffe, now has her own store full of overpriced furniture and clothing. There's a theater where you can watch someone give odd performances, and walk out with a new expression for your character to do while walking around. The black market businessman Redd is back, but he requires both an invitation AND a bit of money to enter his shop now. And there's also a barber, shoe shiner, and Katrina the fortune teller has a building as well. It sounds like a lot, but it's usually a waste of time coming here unless you REALLY want to fill your catalog and spend a lot of Bells on Gracie's stuff. It's not much of a city, especially when everything's on one side of the street.My other problems have to do with minor things and the controls. The main complaint I have as far as minor things go (aside from the rolling world) is that when you run around on the grass, which is what covers the majority of your town, it deteriorates quickly, resulting in your town turning into a desert wasteland. You'll need to plant flowers over any dead areas in order to restore the grass, but it a lot of time. I guess this was made so that characters could create paths to areas they frequent the most, but when you're chasing after super fast dragonflies, you're going to be killing off a lot of grass quick. So...unless you don't care about how your town looks, you're going to be walking most of the time. But the controls are something that I couldn't get used to. The game uses the nunchuck for movement with the analog stick, and the Wii remote for selecting things from the item screen. Why? Why can't we just use the analog stick for everything?In the end, the whole game feels rushed, and I can't recommend this to longtime fans. If you've never played an AC game before though, you're in for a treat, as I have fond memories from getting into this series years ago and having everything feel so new to me. This is truly a unique franchise, but I hate seeing a lack of progress on Nintendo's part with this version. I hate that the best new feature to me was that you can take pictures in-game and save them to the SD card, but even then, you can only have one picture saved on the menu at a time.But you know what? The Wii IS backwards compatible with GameCube games...and the old Animal Crossing is cheaper than this. So...","Trust me, it hurts to give this 2 stars."

    Nintendo",1,"The original Animal Crossing is wonderful. I bought it shortly after it came out (several years ago), and yet I still play it! I bought this new version, expecting the same core gameplay, updated for the Wii. Well, that's what I got. Only problem is, as other reviewers have said, there are very few updates. That wouldn't bother me so much, but what has been changed has been changed for the WORSE! Instead of the simple ""acre"" system from the first game, you now have to walk on a round ""globe"". Personally, it made me dizzy, and it also makes it hard to find things. Everything must be controlled with the Wii remote. To do something as simple as open the menu, you have to raise your arm, move the cursor, and click on something (where previously you could just push a button); while walking around, I had to keep my arm raised CONSTANTLY. Very tiring. But the worst of all is that you can no longer ask your neighbors for jobs, etc! THEY will approach YOU if they want something; if you talk to them more than once in a row, they get annoyed and start yelling at you. This makes it much harder to find things to do. Just to add insult to injury, they now make you water the flowers. That's right, you must water EVERY SINGLE FLOWER, EVERY DAY. Otherwise they turn brown.  After two days of watering flowers and hanging around, waiting for the villagers to ask me for something, I got bored out of my skull and went back to the GC Animal Crossing. I have never been happier. End of story.","Exactly the same, only BAD!"

    Nintendo",1,"I missed the Gamecube US debut of AC, but I played through Wild World and loved it, for a while.  The thing about AC is how quickly you become addicted to it, then how quickly you burn out.  By connecting to other players' towns, you can quickly collect millions of bells you never earned, as well as all of the other fruits, and even some rare flowers if they're willing.  What this does is let you pay off your multiple mortgages almost instantly, which defeats the entire purpose of the game.  Once I had the biggest house, and the biggest store, there was nothing left to do except hunt for the UFO.  Now, Nintendo has basically rereleased the same game on Wii.  Sure they moved several NPC dealers to a separate screen i.e. ""the city"" but nothing has really changed.  You still need to trade annoying friend codes, you still need to coordinate multiplayer via a third party instant messager, cell phones, etc.  This game is great for players who have never stepped foot in the AC world before, which I guess is the majority of Nintendo's new expanded audience, but for the experienced player, avoid this until they actually do something new with the franchise.",Basically a Furniture Expansion

    Nintendo",2,"Wii Sports Resort is fun, but unfortunately after playing it for a little less than an hour I felt like I had done all there was to do.  The game is as shallow as can be, there's no story, no depth or reason to any of the mini-games.  It's just a menu, and a handful of games, and that's it.  Some games are fun, others feel way too gimmicky and aren't very responsive.  The graphics are beautiful if a bit simple.  Great colors, and the island setting is lovely.  One thing I really hate about this game is the loading.  For games that are so simple, and over so quick you have to sit through way too many loading screens, island panning camera shot intros, warnings about wrist straps, warnings about remote gloves, warnings about seizures... it goes on and on!  You end up sitting through about 3 mins of warnings and loading screens to play a mini game that lasts 2 mins.  It's very tiring.  If you're playing a game as simple as Wii Sports Resort everything should be instant in, instant out.Ultimately, I found this game pretty disappointing, especially at $50.  The price tag wouldn't have been so bad if the Wii Motion Plus was actually being utilized by more Wii games, or if this game had more depth to it, but it's not and it doesn't.  There are only a handful of other games that use the accessory, and most of them are not very good at all.  Nintendo has really been cranking out a lot of under utilized accessories for the Wii, and that's very disappointing.  Note to Nintendo: I don't want or need any more piece of white plastic in my house for your system, I need more first party games!  hat's not to say that there isn't fun to be had with Wii Sports Resort, but don't expect to hold your interest for very long, especially if you don't have a friend or two to play with...","Gets repetitive very quick, Motion Plus add-on not really used in any other decent games."

    Nintendo",1,"Lately, the word Nintendo has almost become synonymous with thinking outside of the box.  First they released Wii Sports to the glee of consumers, which played a major role in increasing the size of the casual market.  Next came Wii Fit, which also sold like hotcakes despite having a ninety dollar price tag.  These unique gameplay concepts appealed to people, because they could partake in non-strenuous physical activity in the comfort of their home.  Pick up and play games have become increasingly popular, and Wii Music has been designed in the same mold.  Unlike the previous two games however, Wii Music fails to deliver an experience that will captivate most consumers.  The marketing behind Wii Music will likely trick your average consumer, but the gameplay behind it will probably disappoint most people once they get their hands on it.  Swinging a racket in Wii Tennis was a lot of fun, because it felt similar to the real thing without being overly complex, but Wii Music's gameplay feels as if it were made for those not yet ready to enter grade school, even though it is an experience made for everyone.Admittedly, the concept behind Wii Music is a good one--the game claims to have 60 playable instruments, but in reality, that isn't entirely true.  While there are 60 instruments, there are only four control methods, so you are basically playing the same four instruments the entire game.  Sure, they sound slightly different--close to their real life counterparts with a diminished sound quality, but using them feels the same.  One of these control methods has you holding the instrument like a recorder--you hold the instrument close to your face and alternate pressing the 1 and 2 buttons.  You'll do this for most wind and brass instruments included in the game.  The next control method has you playingguitar-like instruments by holding the Wii-nunchuk steady in your left hand, while moving the Wii-mote up and down as if you were strumming a guitar.  Unlike the recorder-like control, this doesn't feel much like the real thing.  The third control method has you playing instruments such as the piano and drums by moving your left and right hands up and down as if you were hitting a drum.  Many of the instruments use this control method, so eventually this gets tiresome.  I often felt like I was a baby throwing a tantrum.  Actually, if I was a baby, I probably would throw one because of the boring, repetitive gameplay.  Finally, the fourth control method has you holding your left hand steady while moving your right hand horizontally and simultaneously pressing the B button.  This movement is meant to simulate moving a bow across the string as you would with a violin or cello.  These four methods are decent during your first thirty minutes playing Wii Music, but they quickly grow old, and don't give you the feeling that you're playing real instruments.Not only are the control methods flawed and unoriginal, but the core gameplay is lacking as well.  Unlike Guitar Hero and Rockband, there aren't scores or ways of capturing how well you play.  In jam sessions, where you can play with up to four people, there are note charts you can look at, which tell you the optimal places to play the notes, but you are also encouraged to use improvisation to give the pieces you play a unique flair.  This is a cool feature, but your pieces will never sound as good as you hope, due to the low quality sound in Wii Music.  It would be nice if the pieces featured CD quality sound, but I suppose that won't be a huge issue to kids just looking to have fun.  Still, the game definitely feels lacking since it doesn't really have a system in place to help you perform the pieces the way they were meant to sound.  Like other reviews have said, Wii Music is really more of a toy than a game.  There aren't many objectives to complete, and the gameplay is extremely simplistic for the most part.Wii Music does have its merits however.  While the song list doesn't feature pieces that are popular today, it features many well known American classics, as well as world music.  I heard many of these songs as a kid, and it was cool to experience them again despite the poor quality audio.  Wii Music contains very little video game music: the Mario theme, Zelda theme, Mute City from F-Zero, and a couple Animal Crossing songs.  Well, it also includes the Wii Sports and Wii Music themes, but to me they just sound like elevator music.  It would have been great if more Nintendo songs were included, but the song list is still a good selection for general audiences for the most part.  Wii Music has many famous songs such as Ode to Joy, Minuet in G Minor, Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star, Yankee Doodle, and The Loco-Motion.  There are also international songs like Frere Jacques and Sakura.  The fifty included songs will keep you busy for awhile, but it is a chore unlocking them.  You have to go through many tedious ""training"" modes as well as watch many saved videos of your performances in jam sessions.  Even when you unlock all the songs, the repetitive nature of the game will quickly set in due to the lack of gameplay goals.Besides single and multiplayer jam sessions, Wii Music includes a variety of other modes.  If you have a Wii Balance Board, you have the option of engaging in a special drum-training session that utilizes the board.  It is fun to mess around with in  a regular jam session, but the training mode is far too difficult due to the unintuitive nature of the control set-up.  A full drum set includes many parts, so it is understandable that this mode isn't easy, but Nintendo could have made it a little more intuitive.  It is difficult to manage using your feet on the board and waving both arms in a variety of ways, while holding or depressing buttons at the same time.  Some of the motions do drastically different things depending on what button you're holding down, so it all just becomes too much to keep track of.  If you have a board, just mess around with it in jam sessions.  The other modes are less complex and are generally more enjoyable.Handbell Harmony is an entertaining mode that has you using your rhythm skills.  In this mode, your Mii holds two different colored bells at the top of the screen.  On the main section of the screen, you'll find colored bells scrolling by, and when your colored bells enter a bell shape contained in a bar on the center of the screen, you swing your arm that is holding that color.  In this mode, you are graded on how well you do, so it is fun challenging yourself to see if you can get the correct timing when the mode is set at high tempo.Pitch Perfect is another fun mode, but it is more in lines with music education than actual playing.  For those who have perfect pitch or have played an instrument in the past, you'll probably find this mode fairly easy.  I managed to breeze through all the lessons but one without losing, and that one loss was due to a minor mistake.  This mode could be useful to those who are new to music, but it may also be frustrating to those who lack patience.The other two modes are fairly disappointing.  One of them, Mii Maestro, has you conducting a symphony.  To conduct, you simply lift your arm then bring it down at whatever speed you wish.  This allows you to control the tempo and volume of the orchestra.  It doesn't feel very accurate however.  I used to be in a symphony, so I have witnessed a conductor on multiple occasions, and conducting is much more complex than a simple up-and-down hand motion.  It didn't feel very accurate, and even though I knew some of the pieces and have good rhythm, I still couldn't figure out how to get a high score for some of the songs.The final mode is a set of lessons for various styles of music.  There are lessons for rock, jazz, reggae, classical, and Japanese music.  Each of these lessons teaches you little tricks for using certain instruments, but the techniques given are difficult to remember, and you'll quickly become bored after playing Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star over sixty times.  It was nice to be able to hear each instrument and learn what instruments go well together, but the way in which the techniques are taught will make you wonder why you are wasting time with this game.Lastly, I will briefly mention Wii Music's presentation.  The presentation is similar to Wii Sports and Wii Fit--the interface is simplistic, and a minimalistic approach is used with the graphics.  This likely won't surprise anyone who has played other casual games for Wii.  I like how the interface is simple, but there are some design flaws.  For one, the musical maestro who teaches you everything is extremely annoying, and someone who observed me play this game commented that he sounded like he was speaking gibberish with Mario's voice.  He quickly becomes annoying, and at times there is far too much text.  One aspect of the presentation is impressive however--I like how you can send videos of your performances to friends online.  While sharing videos is a cool feature, it doesn't do much for Wii Music since it is such a boring game.  It is unlikely that your friends will want to yawn at your videos when they are already bored to tears by their own.I am extremely disappointed with Nintendo's latest casual game for Wii.  As a long time supporter of the company and Shigeru Miyamoto, I was surprised at how mundane this title turned out to be.  I was definitely expecting more in the gameplay department.  There are many other casual games that are more fulfilling than Wii Music.  Nintendo has gotten lazy recently, and to keep them in check, I recommend that consumers avoid this title and make better use of their money by purchasing one of the great original games that have been released this year.  I mean come on, would you rather spend fifteen dollars for a masterpiece such as World of Goo, or spend fifty dollars on a noisemaker?",Relive Your Rattle-Shaking Days

    Nintendo",2,"I haven't played much of this game, but what I have played I really didn't like.  I was skeptical of this game from the get go, but now that I've seen it in action, I can definitely say it is not the game for me.  The gameplay is extremely simple, except for the simulated drums using the balance board, which turned out to be a little too complicated and awkward.Overall, a lot of the motions and actions are kind of fun, but the game honestly feels like one decent mini-game idea that could have been pulled out of Mario Party or Raving Rabbids.  Then the mini-game became bloated, over-hyped, and then was slapped with a [....] price tag just in time for the holidays.  In fact, if parts of the next Mario Party or Wario Ware titles were to include a Wii Music mini-game, I think that I would enjoy them in small bites.Most disappointing is the selection of music and the sound quality.  It's not terrible, but it definitely isn't great either.  Part of that probably has to do with making the game so flexible with the types of sounds that can be used to play a song, but the music is rarely emotionally satisfying.  A lot of classic Nintendo tunes I was hoping far aren't even in the game and everything else just feels kind of tacked on, although I admit having fun messing around with the Zelda theme song.I can see the appeal that this game may have for children and families, but as a male adult gamer without children, this game has very little to offer me.  I'm glad I didn't buy it.  If my were friends playing when I visited them I would probably join in for a few minutes and have some fun, but the overall experience feels full of potential, but ultimately lacking and definitely not worth the full [..].  This almost feels like a pack-in product, a game that should have come free with every Wii this Christmas like the Wii Sports game.  It's not bad, but it definitely isn't great.I personally recommend either Rock Band 2 or Guitar Hero: World Tour instead if you have the extra cash to spare.

This game just isn't consistent in moving the ball in the direction that you hit it. I tried the game because I enjoyed Wii Sports Tennis so much. I thought it would play like that game, but with more features and details since it's a stand alone game. But I was disappointed in that I wasn't able to have the same amount of control over the ball as I had in Wii Sports Tennis, and for me that's the point of the game.

    Nintendo",2,"It is! It's my fault for being desperate for a good JRPG on my DS. I'm so desperate that I'll pick up the aggressively mediocre spawn of one of my favorite portable RPGs, and you know what? I'll probably even play it to the end. Golden Sun: Dark Dawn is a disappointment, made all the more so by the excellent first installment of the series, which came out way back in 2001. The sequel, Golden Sun: The Lost Age, well-reviewed but unplayed by me, came out back in 2003. I'd always wanted to pick it up if I found it for cheap, but haven't had the opportunity. Now I'm not so sure.The gameplay of Dark Dawn is fairly standard turn-based RPG fare, which is just fine with me. There aren't enough games of that description coming out anymore, and even Square's Final Fantasy series doesn't really fit the mold anymore. The problem isn't with the underlying system, which hasn't evolved much since 2001 and doesn't need to, but the balance of the game. Somehow, and I have no idea how this happened, Dark Dawn manages to have very few random battles and simultaneously be easier than just about any RPG I've ever played. I'm not asking the game to make me grind, but at 15 hours I have yet to use an item for healing. I also have yet to have a character knocked out. The last 2 boss battles are the first ones where I've needed to heal at all.I never thought I'd complain that an RPG had too few random battles, but here it is; Golden Sun: Dark Dawn has too few. Since they're so easy, one can blow through them by tapping A over and over again to use the regular attacks with no strategy, no peril, and no challenge.And that's not getting into the lack of boss battles. It used to be standard procedure- finish a dungeon, there's a boss. The bad guy shows up? Fight his underling, and/or him. Creepy plant look at you funny? Kill it dead. But for some reason, modern RPGs miss this, and Dark Dawn is a particularly bad offender. Somehow, the developers thought that after a long conversation with the game's villains, we would be all geared up to... exit the dungeon and return the world map. How hard is this? Color swap some late-game enemies, add a single line of dialogue (""Enough talk! Face this thing I found under my sink!"" or some such), and cue the special music. You can even skip a couple of those steps if you're lazy. Just give me more bosses! Or stronger regular enemies! Anything to make the game more challenging!The basic strategy for any boss battle can be summarized by this; unleash all your djinn, cast the highest-level summon you have, and if the boss is still alive, attack until the djinn are reset and repeat. I've fought one boss so far that lives through the first step. I assume the game thinks that unleashing djinn is a trade-off to the increased stats that they grant, but honestly? I never even noticed. A risk-reward system of this type would be an interesting was to improve on the old RPG formula, but it's a wasted opportunity here.And that's not even touching that statuses hardly have any affect on gameplay; I've been ""wrapped in delusion"" more times than I can count and I still don't know what it does. Locking an enemy's psyenergy sounds useful, but why bother, since the game is so easy? And once again I have the question of why regular attacks don't wake sleeping enemies or party members. The game also seems to think that packing dungeons with items that heal these will somehow balance this, when really it just makes me think, ""Aw, I wanted new armor.""AND money is a joke. I never had to sell equipment or anything else in order afford new equipment, and the one time I couldn't afford new equipment for everyone, it didn't even matter because the game is so easy. Since there's no point in buying healing items, and the statuses that actually do something (like being haunted) can't be cured with items anyway, I am sitting on a big pile of money that can't be used. The buying and selling interface could be better, too, but it's a minor complaint among these others.But let's step back from all that. Golden Sun: Dark Dawn's dialogue is wretched, even by JRPG standards. I expect some of this. I expect people to talk too much in these games, as a rule. I still don't know what happened throughout most of Final Fantasy XII. But that game was great. There's a sequence in Golden Sun: Dark Dawn, in which the characters indicate that they are rushing to save someone's sister, and that she will be boiled alive if they fail (really). During this section of the game, the characters WILL NOT SHUT UP. Forgive me if I can't sweep this under the rug of ""RPG conventions,"" but can ANYBODY play this sequence and doubt for a second that the sister will be rescued? Can anyone think that their actions will matter in the slightest as to whether the sister will live or die? There are times I can buy this; I understand that Sephiroth's Meteor will hit earth ""sometime soon"" even as I endlessly force chocobos to mate for my amusement. But there are sequences in that game that involved real urgency, where the player's actions could actually make Cloud and friends fail.It doesn't stop there. Dark Dawn's dialogue endlessly repeats itself, even when it writes in sequences that seem designed to avoid doing so. An example; the character Sveta can read minds, and once she does, what does she do? Repeat the same thing that all the other characters in the room, we, and everyone else in the game world ALREADY KNOWS. AND THEN THE OTHER CHARACTERS, WHOSE MINDS HAVE JUST BEEN READ, REPEAT IT TOO. Who can defend this writing?The game's puzzles are marginally better than its dialogue. That is, until one picks up the ""Insight"" psyenergy, which literally puts a filter on the screen that shows you the solution to puzzles. Some of them overcome this by being about positioning and/or some other cleverness, but they are the exception when they should be the rule. Stuck? Use Insight. Now you're not.The looks great and sounds pretty good (though many of the tunes are less memorable than in the first game, and the color palette seems a bit muted compared to that, too), but art design can only go so far. At this point, we need better than competent and good-looking. The only reason to consider Golden Sun: Dark Dawn is if you're like me; starved for a traditional JRPG on a portable system. Lord knows I won't blame you for picking it up, but if you do so before getting the infinitely superior Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 4 remakes, you've lost your will to be entertained.","It's my own fault, really"

Most of the game is spent twiddling your thumbs while you travel to different locations, much like WindWaker.

The controls are the same from Phantom Hourglass like the stylus touch. This game had one crappy feature blowing to the microphone of your DS lite, DSI, or 3DS and I had a hard time to blow to get the right tones of that stupid flute. The dungeons are short and not challenging like Phantom Hourglass. Phantom Hourglass is a better Zelda game than this game. I hate the stylus touch of Spirit Tracks except Phantom Hourglass, blowing on the microphone to get the right tone.

    Nintendo",2,"If we would have rated this game in the first 5 hours of gameplay, this would have probably been a 5 out of 5 stars game. Most of the problems of the original were fixed, there was less or no repetition, very good puzzles and a great story. A win-win for the gamers.Unfortunately though, it turns out that the developers don't know their fans. The game becomes insanely difficult towards the end. Puzzles become completely illogical and require a lot of trial and error for solving them. What adds to the frustration is that this is a portable game and many times, you won't be playing this in a place where you have a pen/paper close. And no, can't use the screen, when this spans multiple levels.Controls - never an issue before - become extremely frustrating. You basically have to control 2 characters and select multiple items, while timed events happen. Considering how much you have to do, maybe the stylus control shouldn't have been the best choice for this particular game. Many times you know what you have to do, yet can't do it because of the stylus control.The game is so difficult that no kid could play and finish this by himself. This is pretty much designed for adults.  Playing the flute and using the tornado - were all great ideas, but are overused. Who wants to be somewhere in public and keep blowing in the microphone??Overall - this is a big disappointment. Hate to say it, but the Ocean Temple suddenly sounds like fun...

    Nintendo",1,"dont even know why this game is called Spirit Tracks because a more apt title would have been ""Phantom Hourglass with trains.""Instead of a boat, we are now given a train to operate. You arent able to actually explore the game and your forced to specific train trackss set across this tiny world. You can go normal speed, fast, stop, or reverse which is all you can do with your train. You get a cannon later on which makes the train portion even worse than it already is and you have a gimmicky horn to use for the sake of being a gimmick. You cant actually enjoy a peaceful stroll down the countryside and are instead forced to shoot and kill the various pigs, birds, pirates, snowmen, etc. that attack you and your given 4 measly hits. Sure you can always get more health for your train, but you cant actually do that until the mid-point and even then, the chances of you having the rare treasure it requires to get new parts is slim to none. There are even ""bomb-trains"" as I call them out on the tracks that will chase you and kill you instantly. There is no way to slow these down or destroy them and more often than not you will get corned by 2 of them and die, again, because there is nothing you can do. It becomes a boring chore just to attempt to go from Point A to Point B while in your train, and 90% of the time, mostly because of bomb-trains, it ends up being Point A to Point C, than D, than E, and so on before you reach your destination. Anytime you have a passenger riding with you is annoying as well and if they get mad enough, they simply get off and your forced to pick them back up again and start the whole process over again. Didnt honk your horn? They get angry. Went to fast? They get angry. Went to slow? They get angry. These people will get angry about anything which makes the train portions even more boring, gimmicky, and pointless.The dungeons and bosses themselves are simply pathetic. There is a reason why this is rated for 10-year-olds, because these dungeons were catered to 10-year-olds. Whatever happened to the reasonably difficult dungeons from the previous games that actually made you think? In this game your brain really isnt required, especially when you can write down anything you need to know because God-forbid you cant remeber something for a few seconds.This game is also more repetitive than Phantom Hourglass was. Go do a few floors in the spirit tower, go to the main dungeon, get side tracked because you have to solve everyones problems, learn a pointless song you will never use, get inside dungeon, kill boss, rinse and repeated another 6 times and the game is over. Whoever decided that this was ever a good idea to begin with and thought it would be ingenious to bring it back again should be shot. The only redeeming quality about it being repetitive is that the primary dungeon doesnt have a timer and you dont have to repeat floors that you already cleared.The controls are also horrible. Say for instance you wanted to use the whirlwind item. You would have to open up the menu, select it, tap the icon in the corner, point in the direction you want to use it, and blow into the mic. In other words, plenty of free hits for the enemies. The same directions are the same things you have to do for the other items as well. Not the mention, the pan flute is annoying and pointless. I got tired of having the blow into the mic to use it after the first time, and than I got annoyed with it after the 30th time. The constant mic use is just annoying, gimmicky, and pointless. It would have not hindered this game to add in D-Pad controls, but no, Nintendo had to make this game for the crowd of casual gamers that think its revolutionary to have touch-screen controls that make a bad game worse than it already is.Simply put, this game was trash. It was the same un-enjoyable experience I had with Phantom Hourglass years ago and little to nothing was improved. In fact, they managed to take the same game and make it worse. Skip this garbage and go find something decent to play.",The Worst Zelda Ever Made

    Nintendo",2,"Spirit Tracks is a game more concerned with being clever than being fun.  Much of this game is spent riding a train very slowly, and a large portion is spent fighting the DS microphone.  The rest of this game is spent wrestling a touch only control scheme that loves to flake out when you least need it to.  If you can get past these contrived unnecessary annoyances, you'll find a decent Zelda game lies buried beneath.  Somewhat entertaining as it is though, Spirit Tracks goes off the rails far too often to ride high with the best of this series.",All abhorred?

    Nintendo",1,"Only being able to use the stylus in this game sucked. It's great for mapping out trails while riding the train, but when it comes to being inside dungeons and navigating though them, using the stylus was redicilously fustrating.  Also, using the stylus to fight with a screen that measures 5""x6"" wasn't fun either. The stylus and my fingers were always in the way of the game screen, blocking my view of ""someting,"" so I couldn't see well enough to do things, and just like the Resident Evil series games, not being able to move and shoot at the same time is no fun at all.Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, Wind Waker, and Twilight Princess are Zelda games that I really enjoyed playing, and I like using regular controlers to play video games. With the Nintendo DS, Wii, and Wii U game systems going in the direction of using a stylus and motion controllers, I guess the Zelda series is also going that direction too. But I won't be traveling with them. So I guess my Zelda gaming experience is over for now.  But, it was fun.",More fustrating than fun.

    Nintendo",2,"It has some improvements over Phantom Hourglass, but other parts fail to measure up.I'll just get this out of the way at the beginning. I personally did not like the idea of Trains in Hyrule.  In fact, I am tempted to slap my forehead and curse out loud as I write this. It just didn't seem to fit the style or setting of the franchise, and I have no clue why they resorted to this gimmick, and even made it a central component of the game.  I would have loved a wide open field to explore, free of tracks and predetermined paths. Instead we get a literal Railroad Plot.The puzzles involving the Train aren't usually hard, but they can be tedious and frustrating. For example, if you are ever tempted to track down the rabbits that appear alongside the tracks, prepare to be annoyed. Because bomb trains are everywhere, and if they hit you, you die, that's it. You can stop them temporarily, if you're determined, but you cannot destroy them.  Avoiding them will often take you on elaborate tangents, far from your destination. If you're not sure where exactly your destination is, such as when searching for rabbits, this can get old real fast.The combat in dungeons isn't too bad, in fact, in some ways it's an improvement over the previous Top-Down adventures.  Aiming the bow and other projectiles at various targets is usually simpler and more natural. Switching between items can be annoying though, and you can only select one at a time.I was baffled by one puzzle.  When I eventually came to a solution, it seemed very strained, and didn't even work the first time. I'm still not sure to this day if that was what the developers intended.You don't get access to new train pieces until what seems like halfway through the game.  Even then, you need certain rare items to trade for them, and your chances of having most of them are far to none.  I have yet to complete this game, but I have gotten pretty far.  I just kind of lost interest and motivation at this point. The story, although boasting a few interesting elements, is rather plain and boring.  The Locomos, or whatever they are called, are a race of beings so contrived I find it almost gag inducing. How do they get up and down stairs?  The world, despite all its miles of Train Tracks, seems small and desolate. Even the Castle Town, which by all rights should be the largest settlement in the game, feels tiny. There doesn't seem to be as much going on as in say Majora's Mask, or even Wind Waker. Most characters fail to inspire any kind of connection or interest. I'm almost convinced they wanted to churn out one more Zelda game for the DS, just so they could get their money's worth out of the Phantom Hourglass character models.To be fair, it's a fun game most of the time I'm not on the train. It just doesn't feel well fleshed out. There doesn't seem to be much worth earning that's not essential to the completion of the main story. I honestly like collection quests when the objectives aren't unreasonable and the rewards are something fun, such as the plethora of Masks in Majora's Mask, or the metric tons of sea booty in Wind Waker. But there's just not much I can say for Spirit Tracks as a classic game. It simply doesn't measure up. I don't regret that I bought it, but it's far from essential to my gaming collection. It's just something to pass the time until the the next Wii Zelda game comes out.",A mixed bag

    Nintendo",2,"Zelda games have always been about action and adventure. Take out both of those, and you're left with Spirit Tracks. It's, at best, some sort of glorified puzzle game.The gameplay is monotonous. The puzzles are tedious. The tricks (such as trains that try to run you over) are annoying and seem to introduce artificial challenge just to make the game last longer. The story is meaningless (I didn't much care about trains before, and now I really, really don't care for them). In fact, the very concept of using a train to get around is not only silly and irrelevant to the Zelda franchise, but also an annoying layer that really cements this game's status as a waste of time. At least in The Wind Waker you had the chance to move around, dodging obstacles and choosing your path. In this game you are stuck on a linear track with occasional choices. When you're confronted with an enemy you have to tap furiously at it to throw cannon balls, which is rather unengaging. And if you get on a collision course with an enemy train there's no way to remove yourself - it's game over.The sound track, a usual high point for any Zelda game, is uninspired. Other than the main theme the tracks fall flat. You won't find yourself humming them or wanting to hear them. They just exist.This game is frustrating on many levels.

Nintendo seems more intent on showing what 'can' be done, as opposed to what 'should' be done.  Nothing is more frustrating than wanting to play the game, and having a directional control pad RIGHT THERE, and not being able to move your character with it.  Nope. they want to show off their touch screen and have you move your character by touching and sliding a stylus across the screen.  Sorry Nintendo, that's like trying to read braille when you can actually see.  It's totally backwards and makes playing the game much too awkward and not fun at all.  It's the same thing they did with the Wii in making you actually have to swing around your remote to try and fight enemies instead of just pushing a button.  It's just showing off features instead of actually making the game where it would be easier to play.  I tried it for about three minutes, and got so frustrated that the game went into the trash.  Thank god they learned their lesson for the new Link Between Worlds and went back to the way the game was meant to be played.  I mean if they want to have this feature...fine, but also give us the option to using normal controls.  But nope, they give us no choice.  Just because the system has a touch screen and stylus, that doesn't mean you have to make those features the main way to control this type of game.

It has the same look, feel, and sound, yet the first game's puzzles seemed to require thought, the new puzzles on this version, however, only require patience and good attention whilst reading. Any other puzzles are almost identical to the first game - draw the shortest path, for example. As an example, some puzzles require that you notice the math results are in a different measurement, inch versus feet, for example, others require you place objects in a way that fits in an area, most others are simply trial and error. The first of the former will only catch those who have been bored by the long delays navigating from screen to screen and clicking on random objects trying to find a puzzle, the other two types, again, simply require you spend minutes trying out different results - rotating and moving things, etc.My advice is that if you haven't played the first, get that one.

Of course I wasn't expecting much since previous incarnations of that combo have amounted to little more than electronic ""Rock, paper, scissors"" and I was pleasantly surprised when the battle system at least was decent, but it has other issues.To start, the rating is accurate. The story is so squeaky clean and typical that even the parts meant to be interesting and funny won't make anyone who's over the age of five so much as crack a smile. You start as a boy who somehow has the funding to travel to a tropical island and live in a fancy hotel without parental supervision in order to train large carnivorous animals to battle other large beasts, perfectly thoughtless setup. This island is mostly populated with women yet for some reason you can't play one: Score one for equality, right? Wake up Nintendo, and realize that women are 30% of gamers now. As if that wasn't good enough, to progress and level up you get sent on fetch quests (Everyone loves a pointless fetchquest!) to hurry the plot along, and fight the same baddies it seems like an infinite number of times.""SPOILERS"" DO NOT READ NEXT PARAGRAPH IF YOU WANT TO BE SURPRISED BY THE PLOT OF THE GAME!Some parents also may want to know that this game eventually delves into beings evolved from dinosaurs from another planet that are trying to colonize the earth by de-evolving all humans back to our rodent ancestors. One character gets turned into a giant rat, another gets fossilized and then resurrected, yeah, it's that level of stupid. Make sure that if your kid gets interested in dinosaurs you buy them a good fact-filled book or something. I know it's a kids game but they could've easily done an educational game instead of this drivel.""END OF SPOILERS""On the pro side are the cleaning minigame, which is varied in difficulty and genuinely fun at times, and the battles. BUT, the amount to which you have to clean during the game borders on obsessive. To get all the species it could be hundreds of rounds of hunting and cleaning, not counting cleaning gems for cash. Battling is in actuality a very small part of the game and what battles you get are often repeats. You never really need to change dinos from your initial team, it's more than easy to beat everyone in the game with one arm tied behind your back.In all the entire game is great if you're 5-7 years old. Easy battles, repetitive gameplay, and simple plot. Even the characters seem to push the camera towards items of interest (""Just go through the door on your left"" Game pauses, then shows left door) and you seem to be constantly followed by a horrible excuse for a female companion who is not only always one step behind you, but who also loves nothing more than entering into 5 minutes of dialog when you just want to explore. Imagine my dissapointment when I discovered you couldn't hit her with the pickaxe!Even as a fan of monster games I just can't give this more than two stars. I swear this game has turned me misogynistic, AND I'M A WOMAN! For better games in this area of interest check out Spectrobes for DS, no dinos, but other similar elements with better execution. Unless I was buying this for a very young child I would avoid it, or at least make sure to give it a try-before-you-buy.

It only saves if you beat an entire world or you manually do it which is total bs.  The multiplayer is the worst I have ever seen in any game ever.  It's a total mess, virtually unplayable with more than two players and even then it's super frustrating because players can cut each others jumps short when jumping at the same time, jump on other players heads driving them into pits, pushing each other off ledges, hit each other with items, kill the other players if you run ahead of them even slightly, die if the other players run ahead or are too far behind you, glitch kill the other players if anyone dies as it freezes all other players for a second if one dies.  If you freeze glitch near an enemy it's game over or if in mid jump it glitch drops you straight down.....hence killing you instantly as 99% of the levels with exception of level 1 world 1 are pits.  The multiplayer in this game is ""trip over the other players feet"" style which I hate just like Battletoads on NES.  For a simple Mario game the controls are mangled, unresponsive and sometimes have a damn mind of their own.  The layout is simple but the response time from the game doesn't match the buttons your pushing most of the time and you end up dead. I have still yet to figure out if the game was made this way or not.  The sliding around, the delayed or no jump sometimes when you hit jump while running and terrible hit detection combined with the 99% pit levels is maddening at times.  I fail to see how this game is for kids, if more than one is playing this at the same time they will probally choke eachother...even single player is to difficult for kids with all the precision pit jumping required.  The cut scenes could have been so much better and actually have effort put into them rather then having the same exact scene 12 times when you beat castles.  I have beaten the game from start to finish worlds 1-9 three times over and overall it was a frustrating as hell experience due to the games horrid controls, mangled hit detection, tired endless pit levels and savagely crippled multiplayer.

I really like ""Super Mario Bros. vs"" for the arcade as well as the recently released Japanese ""Super Mario Bros. 2"" for the virtual console. I have beaten all of them. But something about ""New"" Super Mario bros. is unappealing to me. I bought it for ds and felt ""meh"" about it. Felt more like an ungraded rehash, yet it sold something like 20 million plus copies.Now with New Super Mario Bros. Wii., its more of the same just that now you can have 4 players on screen at once. That i feel is the biggest draw for the game. Other than that, the levels don't really feel like they have a defined theme. For example, Super Mario Bros. 3 had a level with ""large"" characters, or an ocean level where much of it dealt with the frog suit. This game does have the penguin suit and such but it just feels soo uninspired to a veteran player that i consider myself to be.

You can only put together routines using the yoga and strength exercises (no aerobics or balance games can be put into a routine) and it still runs way too slow to be an effective exercise routine, unless maybe if you're elderly. There are some ""pre-made"" routines where 3 things (with one aerobic game) are put together for you but they seem useless to me. Plus, the most annoying thing to me is for some reason they changed the trainer's clothes & background to electric yellow in the routines! It was so ridiculously bright I had to turn the brightness down on my TV! It really is painful, not peaceful, to look at. The original trainer wore blue clothes on a blue background which didn't hurt the eyes. In the regular yoga section the trainers clothes are electric green. Better than the yellow but these ridiculously bright colors make me put the orginal Wii fit disk back in. Also a big loss is instead of having your favorites displayed in the main menu where you can just scroll to it, if you want to run through your favorites list you have to go into a different section and then choose favorites. If you ask me it makes doing your favorites in a row more cumbersome to do. I would buy it again for the chicken & the bicycling but don't expect this to be an improvement over the Wii Fit because they did not accomplish that.

At most, you can only get about 51 stars from doing only the main star missions in all the galaxies up to that point.  You then have to get stars by doing the Prankster comets and various timed race missions (which are HORRIBLE...I've always hated those timed races).  That should not have to be the case at all.  In previous Mario games utilizing the star system, you were able to advance only by doing the main star missions.  Why isn't this the case here?Because of that fact, I give this game 2 stars overall and it's the worst Mario game to date.  It's also a practically complete repeat of the first Super Mario Galaxy game, so it's lacking in originality severely.

    Nintendo",1,"I love The Legend of Zelda. I played, beat, and loved the Zeldas for the NES, SNES, and N64. I didn't like Twilight Princess but Skyward Sword takes the cake as the worst Zelda game I have played to date. I will list my complaints as follows:1. The motion controls suck. There is no way to work with them. I have tried adjusting my wii-mote sensitivity, I have moved my sensor bar, I have tried other wii-motes, but the motion controls just suck. I haven't been able to complete a number of side-quests because they don't respond to how I move the controller. In the bamboo-cutting minigame I can hold the wii-mote perfectly level, pointing straight at the sensor bar, and swing it perfectly horizontally in perfect 30 degree arcs however Link will swing his sword diagonally, and then do a spin attack even though I left the nunchuck sitting on the ground. You can't justify controls that suck this bad. Yes I might be able to beat the mini-game or side-quests after trying them over and over thousands of times, but it wouldn't be a victory of skill, it would be a victory of dumb luck - and that's all the stupid motion controls will let you have. Maybe Nintendo should fire their Japanese engineers and hire some Americans to make them some game controllers that actually WORK.2. Puzzles are mind-numbingly simple. If I can figure it out in less than 30 seconds you just weren't trying hard enough. One particular puzzle in the pirate ship just irked me - you enter a room with a massive shaft of light coming down from the ceiling. Before I could even move, stupid Fi comes out and tells me that she can see the crystal on the roof through the hole in the ceiling. WHY? It would have taken me 5 seconds to figure that out, but now that you've gone and told me how to solve it, I can't even derive any enjoyment out of solving it! The puzzles are stupid, and anytime you get one that requires real thinking, they tell you how to do it!3. I hate the golden harp. I loved the Ocarina in OoT - there were so many songs you could play, and you could even make your own! In particular I loved playing the Song of Storms inside the windmill, and watching the dude with the music box freak out. However instead of improving upon that game mechanic, they chose to simplify it. The harp has no notes and you can only strum it back and forth, and doesn't create anything I could describe as ""music"". All of the ""songs"" in this game sound so deafeningly horrible to my ears that I turn the volume down during music sequences. This is coming from someone who enjoys listening to Classical.4. Fi is ugly. I normally enjoy seeing/playing female game characters and seeing them in many different graphics and art styles. However Fi just creeps me out. When she talks her mouth opens and closes like a ventriloquist's doll, which just makes the singing sequences scare the crap out of me. Also what is up with her outfit? I don't mind if a girl wears fishnet, but Fi is wearing laced-together jumper cables. Ugly, ugly, UGLY!So far I have put over 100 hours into Skyward Sword and I think it is the worst in the series by far. Nintendo needs to buck up and make something that surpasses OoT, which I think they are capable of doing but they need to put some effort into it, and this game just seems like a half-hearted entry into the series.",viciously horrible game

    Nintendo",2,"I have enjoyed Zelda games since the very beginning.  They've had their ups and downs, but overall I've enjoyed them all since the days of NES.  Skyward Sword seems to have taken nearly all of the bad elements of many of the games and combined them into one extraordinarily disappointing experience.First of all, if you remember Navi from Ocarina of Time, you'll remember how annoying being interrupted was.  Multiply that by about 10, and you have Fi, the new ""guide"" for Skyward Sword.  Fi is by far the most annoying companion I've seen in any games.  Allegedly, she's there to help, but her advice is never poignant and always obvious.The major theme of Zelda games, at least for me, has been puzzles.  Figuring out how to solve puzzles is what made most of the previous games enjoyable.  To the extent there are any puzzles in Skyward Sword at all (which are quite few), Fi does one of two things: outright gives you the answer immediately without your request (making them far too easy) or has nothing useful to offer when asked (making them far too difficult).Speaking of interruptions, in Skyward Sword, you need to collect bugs and materials to upgrade potions and items.  That's fine, and actually adds something interesting to the game.  Each time you find a new bug/material, it gives you a display screen giving you its description and showing you where it goes in your inventory.  That's fine for something I've never picked up before, but the game apparently forgets what you've picked up after each time you quit.  So when you turn the game off and back on again, something that you just collected the last time will be shown to you again, regardless of how many of them you have.  It's excruciatingly annoying when you pick up yet another amber relic, having 80 of them, and are then told what it is and shown where it goes in your inventory.  It's just an interruption to the flow of the game.Exploring new areas of the map also made other Zelda games fun.  There are a lot of areas to explore in Skyward Sword.  The first time you explore them, it's fun and interesting.  But then you get sent back to them, again and again and again... that really makes the game drag on.  It's like they wanted to make the game longer, but without new, interesting challenges, just more stuff to do.  This gets old really quickly.The designers of Skyward Sword take advantage of the ability to track motion on the Wii almost too much.  For many enemies, you need to attack with a certain sword angle.  That's fine, but the way the enemies are designed is just odd, and feels completely unnatural.For example, there are skeletons with four arms and four swords.  They'll hold the swords up such that only one side is exposed.  Obviously, you need to attack the exposed side.  However, they have FOUR SWORDS--why is one side ever exposed?  Clearly the skeletons aren't too bright.  As another example, there are little flying balls with a seam, apparently, that you need to attack.  Okay, fine, but different balls have different seams in different directions!  What factory worker goes, ""Hmm, we should really make these flying ball things differently, just to keep people on their toes.""  It makes no sense.Skyward Sword was moderately fun for about 15 hours or so.  After that, it really felt like a grind to the finish.  Poorly thought-out design, with constant interruptions, makes playing to the end virtually impossible with any retention of your sanity.  I sincerely hope that more consideration is put into the next Zelda game.  If the next one is like Skyward Sword, I think it will be the end of me playing any more Zelda games.",Extraordinarily Disappointing

But alas, you get a side swipe instead, and you die?That is Skyward Sword in a Nutshell.  The game's enemies are easy, the controls are notoriously bad.  Imagine if you are playing the original Mario Brothers, and the A button worked 70% of the time.  You'd just give up after a while.  That what this game was.Now, I'm a Zelda fan.  If you check out my previous review of Twilight Princess (for the Gamecube), I really enjoyed it (4 stars).  I finished the first Zelda, Zelda for the SNES, Ocarani of Time, and Twilight Princess.  I enjoyed them all and finished each one.  But alas, I can't finish this one because the controls.  For example, you are suppose to point the sword straight up to gain some power.  Now, the control doesn't tell you want straight up is.  Sometimes it's straight up, sometimes you have to jab at a 15 degree angle left, sometimes a slight push 5 degrees behind.  It's really arbitrary, and really frustrating since it changes by the minute.  When you have to do two in quick succession, it's basically a crapshoot.The Wii is not made for true gaming.  It is not responsive.  There was some poor control choices made for this game.  If they gave us the option to just turn it around and use the non motion controls, I'd be a happy man.  If they let us use the Gamecube controller, I'd be happy.Some of the controls work right.  Controlling the Beetle (a flying projectile you can control).  The nun-chuck movement is good.  But the sword and shield play suffer dramatically.Behind the control scheme is a fun game filled with great puzzles.  I didn't mind the control problems that much, because up until the end of the first temple, it wasn't that big of a impediment.  However, once I reached the first boss, I knew it was beyond playable.Maybe my Wii is messed up.  I don't know.  But I found myself playing against the controls instead of the game.

    Nintendo",2,"Skyward Sword is the epitome of average....at best. The game can be fun at times, but its flaws constantly bring the experience down. Firstly, there is not a whole lot new here except of course for the much talked about motion controls. They are fun sometimes, but not always 100% responsive. You must play this game with the sensor bar on top of the tv. I was at a friends house where his was on the bottom. I borrowed the game for myself. PLayed it and the controls were much better because I had mine on the top. This will save you a lot of frustration. Overall, the motion sensing is pretty good. I could imagine this is how nintendo originally thought it would be before the wii came out. However, there are still times when you want to slash horiztonal or jab forwards and you end up doing something else. You may not think this is an issue, but there are a lot of bad guy and boss fights where you have to swing a certain way or else they will block you. Again, in some boss fights this is detrimental if you are trying to swing but it gets blocked/countered and you end up losing a heart. Its easy to do it wrong and you could lose a lot of hearts. Making for a frustrating experience when you know what to do but can't do it. However the motion controls work great for shooting items.The world itself is quite bland. Its probably the smallest zelda game which is dissapointing. There are about 4-5 main areas in the game including the sky which is also quite small. Its a shame they couldn't make these lands more interesting. Skyloft is quite small, although it is supposed to be an advanced race of people living in harmony in the sky. The surrounding sky areas are littered with floating rock islands. You can explore these after you receive your skybird which you can call on to fly after you jump off a ledge. Flying is done with the wii mote by tilting it in the direction you want to go. I found myself wishing I could just use the joystick because it wasn't comfortable constantly twisting your wrist at all angles. Even still, the sky area is uninteresting and small. Unfortunately, some major review sites such as G4 have confirmed this in their review as well. I just didn't know how limited it would be. When you do fly over an island, you drop off from your bird and use the wii mote to control links falling direction. Its easy to have the wii mote pointing the wrong way and entirely miss the island and have to call your bird and start over because some of the islands are quite small.The gameplay is basically the same as previous Zeldas except this time they added an unnecessary stamina gage. This goes down when Link sprints, climbs or carries stuff. Why it would be so bad to just let you run as much as you want is a mystery. THe only reason for it is to add an extra challenge. You pretty much get all the same items again except for a few new ones. The areas are not too much different. In fact, most are just updated/re worked versions from twilight princess. Skyward Sword is a prequel. This time, link is going down to the ground for the first time, except the player has been there before. Technically, the areas are still different from the last game. They are new, but they are the same types of areas (wooded,  volcanoe, etc). The truly new areas are reserved for later on. Still, the game has you visiting dungeon after dungeon. Personally, I am growing tired of the Zelda formula. They had a real chance to do something different here but I think they blew it. Why did they not create some kind of interesting sky world instead of just making it a hub to get to other places? Unfortunately, all the nintendo fans are delusional and will buy the games no matter what.In summary.Good: Easy to shoot arrows and slingshot. Occasionally cool sword play.Bad: Same Zelda formula. Fight in dungeons through hoards of enemies. Unresponsive sword swings when you need them most. Awkward camera angles in small rooms. Very linear areas. Not many new areas and not many areas. Not a lot of fun to explore the sky. Game makes you backtrack to previous areas you have been to already. Flying the bird is not fun. Stamina gage is unnecessary. Ridiculously long text screens in the beginning and throughout the game (hold A to make it go faster) featuring lame jokes. High school romance between Link and Zelda. Takes too long to get the same weapons from previous games, making it dissapointing that they didn't put that much new stuff in the game.",I think I'm done with Zelda

    Nintendo",1,"Let me preface this review by saying that I'm a Nintendo and Zelda fan. I have played all the Zelda games except for the CD-i games, and have beaten ""Ocarina of Time"", ""Wind Waker"" and ""Twilight Princess"". When 3DS was released in North America, I did not get it on day one, but I did get it on day three, and when ""Ocarina of Time 3D"" was released, I beat it three times, one for each save file you get. I had to delete a save file to play it a fourth time.You are probably thinking that a main-series, console Zelda release can never be less than gaming perfection. However, I would beg to differ, pointing you to ""Zelda II: The Adventure of Link"". ""Skyward Sword"" is the second coming of ""Zelda II"" in that respect, and it has done the unthinkable and finally supplanted it as the most disappointing Zelda game of all time. If you have not played this game, you have no idea how terrible it is, so before you judge this review and vote it down, I implore you to read this review and other ""negative"" (I prefer the term ""honest"") reviews before making your own decision about purchasing this game. Nintendo has really dropped the ball with this game. The release of the MotionPlus accessory never really generated the second life for the Wii that they intended, so they forced it into a traditional core gaming franchise and the result is ""Skyward Sword"".The controls are very bad. Almost every action involving the Wii remote is filled with frustration and stress - from flying to just simply trying to cut grass. Very early on, you get a taste of flying. However, the controls are overly sensitive, yet unresponsive at the same time - the worst of both worlds. For example, you will tilt the controller to the left to turn left, but there will be slight lag until your bird actually turns. To make up for this lag, you will be tilting the controller even more than necessary. By the time you do this, your bird finally has turned, but the extra turning you have done to compensate for the lag has made the bird turn even more than necessary. It's not just the lag that accounts for the bad controls, either. It is just too sensitive. A slight tilt of the controller will cause it to turn a lot, and there is no way to adjust the sensitivity. This is not how we were taught how to fly in real life, or in video games. Flying by tilting a horizontally-aligned controller is simply unintuitive.The sword-controls are terrible as well. Cutting grass - something that has been a staple of the franchise since ""Link to the Past"", is now needlessly difficult. In Twilight Princess, one could simply shake the controller, and Link, your on-screen avatar, would effectively cut grass. In this game, simply shaking the controller is not enough; oh no. You must be precise and shake it horizontally, because grass grows vertically, and thus to cut it, you must chop it horizontally. Now this would not be that big of a deal if when every time or at least 90% of the time you performed a horizontal slice with your controller, Link did the same. However, this is not the case. Also, every little, seemingly innocuous enemy in the game now has become a mini-boss encounter, where precise timing and sword strokes are needed for victory. This is an extrinsic vicissitude for the Zelda series. It slows the gameplay down, and breaks up the pacing.Here are some more examples of the horrible controls:This is not so egregious in execution, but is in theory: walking across a tightrope. When Link walks across a tightrope, he will alternately teeter to the left and right - not because you are failing to hold the controller steady, but because Nintendo programmed him to do so. At first, I was wondering why I was teetering to the left and right when I was holding the controller steady. Then I realized that instead of programming tightrope sequences so that Link's movement intuitively mirrored the player, as in all the other actions, like flying and sword-swinging, they repudiated that philosophy for this one type of event, making the player react to Link's movements, rather than the other way around. This makes no sense in the commonsense, logical desire of having one theoretical, uniform game design philosophy.In another example of paradoxical, inconsistent game design philosophy, the ""Sheikah Stone"" makes a reappearance. It made its first appearance in ""Ocarina of Time 3D"", and it gives players hints when consulted. One of the caveats of this tool is that it is only accessible on Skyloft, the main hub area. The inclusion of the ""Sheikah Stone"" baffles me to a certain extent. I can see how this will help the more casual gamers, but when the controls are unresponsive, rendering the game difficult beyond the reach of casual gamers, I do not see the point of its inclusion. My point is that a ""Sheikah Stone"" should have been the last thing on Nintendo's list of considerations. Their priority should have been to fix the controls, and then a ""Sheikah Stone"" would have been unnecessary.Killing skulltulas is another thing that has been greatly overcomplexified. In ""Ocarina of Time"", killing skulltulas had a short learning curve, but it was understandable and intuitive: if you got too close, it faced you constantly, rendering it invulnerable to your sword. If you got too far from it, it retreated beyond your reach. At just the right distance, it would first drop down and then turn around, exposing its vulnerable underbelly for a brief moment, giving you an opportunity to strike. In ""Skyward Sword"", however even after much trial and error, I could not figure out how to defeat one. I soon ventured forth into the internet in search of a method, and was satisfied when I realized that I was not alone in my troubles. Of course, I also found snarky simpletons who, instead of helping people like me, proceeded to insult them for lack of ""skill"" and took their skulltula-killing troubles as an offensive gesture to their beloved God and king: the almighty Nintendo.One of the most egregious vicissitudes in ""Skyward Sword"" is save-points. Their philosophy was probably twofold: 1) it is not just a save point - you can do some other stuff, like taking to the skies, and it serving as a waypoint as well, and 2) maybe they found that people did not know how to save in Zelda games so they included save-points. The first reason is understandable - adding functionality. The second reason, however, is egregious. In other Zelda games, you can save nearly anywhere. You may not start at that exact location when you turn the system off and return, but your progress will be saved. In ""Skyward Sword"", you must first find a save point, and then when you want to stop playing and save, you must either keep playing and hope to find a save-point, or return to a save point you have already found and then save, wasting time that did not need to be wasted. This is an example of removing functionality: a bad thing.Navi-itis returns. You remember how annoying Navi was in ""Ocarina of Time""? Well, the spiritual successor is here. I won't spoil anything but I will warn you that if your shield is about to break (yes, shields can break in this game - how asinine is that?), or even if you are low on hearts, this Navi-wannabe will annoy you. I think that the traditional pinging sound that was there from ""Zelda 1"" tells me all I need to know about how low on hearts I am!Nintendo seems to be feeling the pressure of being more like ""Monster Hunter"". They have unnecessarily added millions of little knick-knacky materials to collect through the course of your playthrough. These materials can be used to upgrade your items. This is not too bad, since it's optional, but when you come across a material, for example: a feather or a skull, the game must go into an animation of Link holding it up, then it tells you what it is, and then it goes into the menu, showing you how many of it you have. Then, you must exit the menu, if you want to keep playing. Every time you turn off your Wii or quit a play-sesion and then come back to play, if you find something for the first time for that playthrough, it does this again. It's unnecessary and annoying. The same thing happens for the higher-echelon rupees. At least it doesn't do it for blue rupees (worth 5) anymore like in ""Twilight Princess"".Another thing Nintendo has unnecessarily adopted into its game is a partial form of ""floating combat text"". In many other traditional RPGs, when you hit something or it hits you, numbers pop up indicating damage done or dealt. In this game, when you get hit, the same thing happens, but with hearts (e.g. if you lose two hearts, in addition to losing two hearts on your life meter, a ""- [heart icon][heart icon]"" will appear next to it). This is unnecessary and insults the player's intelligence. If I had five hearts and something hit me, and I now have three hearts, I can do the math and figure out that I lost two. I don't need the game to show me.Nintendo knew this game was hard. At first I was taken aback at how Link started off with six hearts. Usually he starts off with three, no? Then I played the first dungeon. ""Oh... That's why.""Not all is bad in ""Skyward Sword"", however. Theoretically, I like the idea of taking a Zelda game into the sky, like how ""Wind Waker"" was an entire Zelda game built around the theme of wind and the ocean. Also, the new stamina-meter, which I disliked at first, grew on me, and I learned to appreciate it. For example, Link can now move faster than his run (let's call the faster run a ""sprint"") without having to roll around all over the place, and he can run into a wall at this speed without bumping into it and subsequently falling down, for the ""roll"" has been remapped to the nunchuk's accelerometer. To roll, all one has to do is sprint and then shake the nunchuk.A new Zelda game wouldn't be complete without some new puzzle-types. I liked moving the key around with the controller to fit into a lock, although it featured reverse controls (up is down, left is right, etc.). In this respect, it does a good job of creating some new puzzles. Incremental challenge is a good thing, as long as the controls don't get in the way of it. As you now know, however, it does get in the way of it. After getting through the first two dungeons, I realized that the most difficult small-fry enemy was one of the first ones you meet: the piranha-plant thingies. This is an example of incorrectly increasing the difficulty of a game.Also of positive note: the ""Deku Leaf"" makes a return, although it is called the ""Sailcloth"" now. Functionally, it works the same as the ""Deku Leaf"". Unfortunately, this welcome return is simultaneously met with an unwelcome alteration in the controls. This item is controlled with the ""Wii Remote Plus"", and, you guessed it, the controls are terrible. Near the beginning of the game, you must use this item to land on a small circle on the ground. I tried at least 20 times before I was able to land on it. Eventually, I realized that the less you moved the controller, the better off you were. You were not controlling the game; you were simply giving the game the input it desired to perform the output you wanted. This is a big change from how most video games are designed. Most video games empower the player and give them the illusion that they're imposing their will upon the game. ""Skyward Sword"", on the other hand, forces you to play by its rules and molds the player into its own, unwilling pawn. Maybe that's why some people like this game. They are unknowingly pawns and tools in the universe, and thus enjoy or are used to being in this position in the world.I found that the most effective way of fighting the Bokoblins (red bad-guys) was not to swing the controller at their weak points but to wait for them to drop their guard, and in that second before they attack, you the player should strike quickly. Waiting for an opening? I understand using that philosophy for designing boss battles, but small-fry enemies should not have been designed like this.The graphics are a mixed bag. Sometimes, especially during cutscenes, I was impressed at what the Wii was capable of. I found myself thinking, ""Is that FMV?"" However, at other times, these times being most of the time, I found myself thinking, ""This looks worse than 'Twilight Princess'."" A lot of the animations and models seem to be ripped straight from that game, tweaked a negligible amount, and then daubed with a low-detail, saturated, faded-rainbow paintbrush. Everything looks washed-out and all the colors seem to bleed together, like a watercolor painting done by an elementary school student. It is hard to tell what is what from a distance. I know what Nintendo was thinking when they went in this artistic direction. They knew they could not compete graphically in the realism department with ""Xbox 360"" nor ""Playstation 3"", so they went in the opposite direction of accentuating their ""superior"" artistic vision, so that the Wii's graphical shortcomings would be ignored with a lush, unique, graphical style. However, it fails to deliver on its intentions. I am not opposed to non-realistic graphics. Oh no. ""Wind Waker"" is one of the most beautiful games ever created, and looks miles better than this game. ""Wind Waker"" was designed to be a ""cartoon that you play"" - this coming straight from Miyamoto's own mouth, and I wholeheartedly agree. ""Skyward Sword"", on the other hand, feels like a rainbow threw up on a Miyazaki film. It just doesn't work. Also, why does Link have to look so much like Michael Jackson? Could he not have looked a little more human, and less extra-terrestrial? Nintendo got his face wrong in ""Twilight Princess"", right in ""Super Smash Bros. Brawl"", then even fixed ""Twilight Princess"" Link's face for the ""Wii U"" Zelda tech demo at E3 this year, but lost it again for Skyward Sword.The music is surprisingly bad as well. The soundtrack sounds less like a Zelda game, and more like a generic JRPG soundtrack. After looking up the credits online, I found that a whole stable of composers not named Koji Kondo was involved in it. ""Ah..."" My suspicions were correct.Nintendo needs to bring Miyamoto back to the director's chair. He understands that gameplay is paramount. When you first start up Skyward Sword, you are bogged down with cutscenes and meaningless fluff in the form of small-talk conversations with NPCs. You may have thought ""Twilight Princess"" got off to a slow start, but holy snap, ""Skyward Sword"" takes it to the next level. If the story and characters were half-interesting, maybe I would care, but unfortunately it is not. People play Zelda games for the gameplay, not the story and cinematic work.It is not the idea of motion-controls in a Zelda game that is the problem here. It is in the execution, which is very bad. If there is copious ambiguity whether my failure to succeed is because it is not what I am supposed to do (as in the proper method of solving a problem) or it is because the controls are not responding to what I want to do, it is a major problem. As the great James Rolfe (the ""Angry Video Game Nerd"") once said, the number one important thing about a game is ""being able to ****ing play it"". I would love to swing my controller and be able to hit the enemies in their weak-spots, quickly and deftly; however, this is not possible because of the horrible control-response. I would love to be able to quickly transition from a neutral state to a rolling state when dealing with bombs, and then dexterously aim it to my own choosing. Again, this is not possible because of the horrible controls. ""Twilight Princess"" was evidence of how motion-controls could enhance a game to make a game greater than the sum of its parts. ""Twilight Princess"" on the Wii was easily superior to the Gamecube version. ""Skyward Sword"", on the other hand, obtrudes the game with its motion-controls, effectively making a gamer lesser than the sum of its parts. I wish there was a Gamecube version of this game.Let me now discuss my rationale for giving it 1 star: If you mouse over the respective stars, from the fifth star to the first star (furthest to the right, to the star furthest to the left), the mouse-over descriptions are as follows: ""I love it"", ""I like it"", ""It's OK"", ""I don't like it"", and ""I hate it"".""I love it"" would be something I would say about ""Ocarina of Time"", and I have thought it to myself, and have even said it out loud to my friend back in 1999 or 2000. These games leave you in awe, feeling like a kid again. Those memories of getting a brand-new game for Thanksgiving-break or Christmas and playing it after you rip through the plastic wrap come flooding back to you. ""Super Mario 64"" and ""Twilight Princess"" are more examples.""I like it"" would be something I would say about ""Wind Waker"". The art direction was revolutionary, but the gameplay seemed to be an incremental evolution from ""Ocarina of Time"". In other words, it was good, but it did not blow my mind. That is fine; not every game can blow your mind.""It's OK"" is something I would say about ""Metroid Prime"". I was never a big fan of the Metroid series, but I did give Metroid Prime a shot and eventually beat it, but sometimes people have different tastes. These tastes are not meant to offend anybody.""I don't like it"" would be something I would say about ""The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion"". It did not do much for me, coming from an MMORPG like ""World of Warcraft"" and trying to capture that magic in single-player form; I have since yet to find a single-player RPG that has really kept me engaged for as long as an MMORPG. I rue the day I ever bought that game (WoW); it spoiled me. Still, I would not say that I hate Oblivion, because there is nothing fundamentally flawed about it; it's just ugly, boring, and not for me.""I hate it"" is not something I say often about video games. I do my research and I have a sixth sense when it comes to buying games and it does not involve internet game-reviews. But when a game is this fundamentally flawed, as in the controls don't work (forget about the design, which is secondary), we have a problem. The only thing I can compare ""Skyward Sword"" to off the top of my head is a really difficult NES game that is cheap (by cheap, I mean the AI is cheap) beyond imagination and is likely to have been reviewed by James Rolfe. Indeed, whilst playing ""Skyward Sword"", I found myself thinking and saying out loud many of his epithets like ""What were they thinking?"" and ""This game is horrible!"" I know there is a ""first impressions"" video on cinemassacre.com regarding this game, but it was made not by Rolfe, but by his friend Mike Matei. I would like to hear Rolfe's own opinions about this game.This has been the most disappointing holiday game lineup in recent history - from the overhyped ""Battlefield 3"", the most iterative game of all time: ""Modern Warfare 3"", the still-ugly-with-terrible-melee-combat Skyrim... What in the world is going on? God save us all.","One small step for Nintendo, one giant step backward for Zelda games"

    Nintendo",2,"When people think of Zelda, they're thinking one of two things: ""Oh boy, a new Zelda!"" or ""Oh boy. A new Zelda.""  I found myself in the first camp as I anticipated what I thought would be a badass entry in my favorite series of games.  With Nintendo promising a more intricate overworld filled with puzzles that seamlessly flowed into dungeons, my mind raced, believing that the era of easy Zeldas designed with kids in mind was over.  What I got instead was a 40 hour fetchquest.I'll probably spoil some stuff so watch it.Also, I got the version with the bundled controller.The controller is nice, and not as fingerprint hungry as the others.Enemies in General:I'll be very blunt. There's about 4 enemies that you'll actually ""fight"" throughout the game. Bokoblins, Moblins, Stalfos, and Lizalfos.  They each come with different ""versions"" of themselves, basically reskinned and using a different weapon, for example the regular Lizalfos and the Dark Lizalfos. Regular ones shoot fire, Dark ones shoot ""cursed breath"" which induces the curse status, new to zelda, which leaves you unable to use weapons/items.  That's about it, aside from the bosses.  Combat is basically finding the obvious weakspot, hitting there, waiting for the enemy to move around aimlessly for a bit, opening the weakspot again, and striking again.  All other enemies are ohko.  But seriously, 70% of what you fight is just bokoblins, with moblins coming in around 7/8th's the way through the game. Every single Lizalfos I fought dropped a tail, and I have 12 of them. Not very many of those in comparison with the rest of the game.  There's beamos here and there, deku babas, and keese too.Dungeons and Bosses:The bosses are pretty fun. You fight Ghirahim three times throughout, the second fight being the most fun.  This fact makes it so that there are less bosses overall, however, as he is the boss of the first and sixth dungeon.  The fourth boss is very very fun, throwing attacks at you and continually getting back up to wreck you.  The fifth boss and fifth dungeon are probably the best in the game with the boss and the setting leading up to and during the fight being really great and immersive.  The boss is a giant Kraken thing with one eye. The dungeon is actually a ship, and once you finish the dungeon and prepare for the boss, it starts to rumble. Giant tentacles begin to tear through the entire ship, leading you back up to the deck.  As I said, this makes for a really cool moment that immerses you completely within the game.  The seventh (and final) dungeon has no boss battle.  The seventh dungeon is however one of the more difficult parts of the game, and it is very enjoyable.  The final boss is absolutely pathetic.The first three dungeons were beyond easy.  Getting inside them was tougher than the actual dungeons.  And getting inside them was basically just, dowse, dowse, dowse, ok now you have gathered X amount of things you need in order to get inside the dungeon which was extremely annoying. Dowsing has you basically moving around your sword in first person mode trying to pinpoint the location of something. Dowsing was originally showcased as a replacement to the compass, but you can't dowse inside dungeons. This continues to a lesser extent later on, but basically instead of exploring the game makes you waste time doing this.  There is not much to explore anyways, since the areas are extremely linear, as is the whole game.As an example, in the first area which is the woods, you have to find a bunch of Kikwis, which are the little tanooki looking creatures.  When you find them all, you go back to their boss which gives you the slingshot, which is required to enter the first dungeon.  Standard fare, but your first time doing this will undoubtedly take you longer than it should. It isn't as seamless as they said.  When they said that, I imagined the world suddenly takes you through an area and you find a chest with a key inside and you realize, woah, I'm in dungeon! I thought I was still just outside! Nope.Controls and Items:I found that in trying to strike quickly, the control would often flip out and do the wrong thing.  For example, if an enemy has an opening that calls for you to strike in a downward and to the right position, and you try to quickly do this motion, more than likely you won't be hitting it correctly, resulting in the enemy parrying or your attack bouncing off and then getting hit, as you leave yourself open.  This was with the actual control that game with the game, not a wii remote + attachment.  When done in a slow motion, it is accurate. So you have to wave gently in order to perform an attack. Doesn't really feel like I'm attacking something.  1:1? I don't think Nintendo knows what that means.  Additionally, it is laggy. It will not perform the movement the instant you do it unless you're moving slowly.  I tested this between 60Hz and 120Hz, and it was definitely worse on the 60Hz (obviously).Flying and swimming are handled in the same manner, by holding the wii remote horizontally and adjusting direction by tilting and twisting.  Some may like this, some may not.  I enjoyed flying and swimming, but it became a bit cumbersome with the laggy response time.The shield mechanic is pretty solid.  You use the nunchuk to throw up your shield to reflect attacks, which normally gives you the chance to counterattack.  If you fail to perform it correctly though, it takes a chunk out of your shield's ""life bar"" which eventually leads to it breaking.  The shield can be upgraded, but it is sort of pointless seeing as you get the chance to buy an improved shield every time you feel like upgrading it.Your other items work pretty spot on, even allowing you to recenter the aim with a press of down on the D-PAD. They all felt good to use, even though they didn't get too much use aside from the beetle.  The Bow and Arrows are the last item you get making it a bit strange that you can't use them to fight much through out the game.  I hardly used anything but the sword as a fighting weapon where as in previous zelda games I'd use almost everything but the sword.  The items are more spread out as well.  Items that we saw like the digging mitts are only useable in specific areas and are not assigned to your item wheel, but instead an equipped item, like a tunic would have been equipped in Ocarina of Time.  Your shield and bottles and nonessential items are stored in a secondary item wheel.  This can be seen as useful or not.  This is just a matter of personal opinion as I'm sure not everyone liked the huge item wheel from Twilight Princess.  This secondary item wheel can only carry four items initially, and must be upgraded by buying more pouches from Beedle in a majorly escalating price point.  The bomb bag and arrow quiver cannot be upgraded, but instead you can buy additional bags or quivers which hold an extra 5 units a piece.  These must go in your secondary item wheel, which can dissuade you from wanting them in the first place.  The game never leaves you without a patch of bomb flowers if you need them or without arrows if you cut the grass.  This same mechanic applies to the ignored slingshot.Plot:The majority of the time, when you get to an interesting plot point, you have to begin another fetch quest.  The biggest of these isSPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERSthe forging of the Master Sword.  This negative point can be attributed to simple fanboy nerdrage, but let's examine it anyways.  In prior Zelda games it is said that the Master Sword is a relic of the ancient Hylians, forged by sages as the blade of evil's bane.  In this game, it is originally called the Goddess Sword, that the goddess Hylia creates in an intricate plot to destroy the game's main villain who gets mentioned about once throughout the game until the very end.  Link has to, in a similar fashion to the also not very good Phantom Hourglass, gather 3 of something in order to turn the Goddess Sword into the Master Sword.  Once you do create it, you get an anti climatic ""MASTER LINK, YOU NOW HOLD THE MASTER SWORD."" from Fi.  The creation of the Master Sword is retconned, and it is made in a way copied from PH.  Cool. Not. This also implies that the people in skyloft are not the Hylians in question from before, as there were people on the surface prior to them.The game also does not explain anything about the hylian crest (the red bird and the triforce) that is present on the shields.  You get the Hylian Shield in the game, with no mention of Hyrule or anything of the sort, but you see the emblem sans the head of the bird and the triforce all over the place though.As for characters, I didn't delve too deeply into the sidequests as I wasn't expecting a second helping of Majora's Mask. The game lets you court several of the female NPC's apparently though. Tsk tsk, cheating on zelda? Shame on you.  You get the standard serving of Zelda people with repeated dialogue and grunts with some comedy here and there, (mostly from Groose).Conclusion:Yes, I understand that all Zelda is is basically a fetchquest.  Going through three dungeons to get the Master Sword is nothing new.Going through three dungeons to FORGE the Master Sword is a problem, to me anyway.I can't really continue with this as it's basically all that needs to be said about this game.Is it worth the money?  Not really.  From what I've seen people are split and either love it or dislike it.The game's length is artificially extended.I'll probably get flamed for writing a negative review of it, but people, I've been making bacon bits out of Ganon since I was four.For me, this is the Other M of the Zelda series and a sign that maybe Nintendo isn't going to be pumping out stuff like it used to.Maybe Groose was right. Maybe it should have been called ""The Legend of Groose.""",Skyward Sword. Eh.

    Nintendo",1,"Metroid has got to be my favorite series of all time:  non-linear exploration, epic battles, and superbly entertaining weapons and power-ups which you get both by following the story line and by NOT following it at all.  No matter what you did, you were either going to be entertained by challenging fights, challenging puzzles, or just the sheer joy of exploration.  You were always alone, but it was alright--Samus just seemed so unflinching.Those days are gone, possibly for good if Nintendo allows for the next Metroid game (if there will be one) to follow this one's design.  You aren't allowed to explore at will anymore, the storyline is bent out of shape, the controls are annoying, the voice acting is bad, and Samus is unrealistically vulnerable as a character.On the Metroid timeline this story falls right after Super Metroid--Zebes is destroyed, along with the last Space Pirate stronghold, not to mention the last Metroids.  After so many years of fighting the Pirates Samus is seemingly left without a cause and begins to resume her old life as a bounty hunter when she picks up a distress signal coming from a remote space station; she decides to investigate and finds that the station she lands on is teeming with dangerous life forms, and the only other humans are a small squad of Federation soldiers.  But not just any soldiers, because two of them used to fight with Samus when she was part of the Army:  Anthony Higgins and Adam Malkovich.  Malkovich was her commanding officer, and this is the precept for just about every cinematic sequence of the game.Unfortunately, this is also the first problem with the game.  Of the time spent playing your are going to have several hours of mandatory, non-skippable cinemas.  So instead of providing you with a game which has in depth gameplay AND an in depth cinematic, you have to watch movie after movie after movie.  The point of this game comes off as being more about Samus's relationship with her previous teammates than the current investigation of the death of almost every human aboard the space station.This doesn't sound too terribly bad, to be honest, because Samus is a character who has been shrouded in mystery pretty much since day one.  It's only natural that we would want to get to know her a little more personally, but unfortunately this ruins the dynamic of a Metroid style game because if you have to pursue the storyline as the movies dictate the joy of exploration just isn't there.  You're meant to find everything you find, to get every power-up you get; your effort (the player's effort) is actually quite minimal.  There's no element of puzzle-solving at all in this game, which is another major departure from the rest of the series.  If you see a door that you can't yet open (because you don't have the right power-up) you aren't allowed to backtrack to open it up after you do have the right power-up unless that area is where the story requires you to be.  And I mean it when I say that you aren't allowed to backtrack--certain doors will be locked (even if you've been through them before) depending on where you are in the story and will not open again until much later.  The designers of the game talked about 'the joy of discovery' in this game; ironically you aren't allowed to discover anything they don't want you to discover.As mentioned, this rigid gameplay is linked to the story, which as a story only sort-of works.  Yes, it's good to get a deeper glimpse of Samus's past, but to make the game focus almost entirely on the past makes things a little less enjoyable.  Especially when you consider that as story lines get more and more complex, and that the tradition in Metroid is to start out with nothing and build your way up, you need an explanation for why Samus doesn't have her full range of gear at the start.  In this game you are denied use of your gear in the beginning on grounds that you are working with other troops and that stray fire from your much more powerful weapons could kill someone; if you need something more intense Malkovich (being the CO) will authorize it.  Sounds logical, until you consider that there are items in Samus's arsenal that wouldn't hurt anyone.  Like the Varia Suit, for example; all it does is reduce damage from enemies and protect Samus from temperature extremes.  Yet there is a part in the game where you have to run through a super-heated area, taking damage from both the heat and the enemies all at the same time, while Malkovich refuses to let you turn on your Varia suit feature.  You're getting cooked to death, which Malkovich knows, but he refuses to let you save yourself.  The same thing goes for the Gravity Suit and the Space Jump--both are perfectly harmless, but you're not allowed to use them because Malkovich says no.  (This in itself is also a huge departure and very un-Samus-like, as Samus usually just does whatever she wants.)  And to make the irony complete, you spend most of your time alone.  No other soldiers to endanger nearby...  Lots of large and dangerous creatures everywhere...  But still no plasma beam...The controls were (largely) designed to work like the classic SNES controls as this game takes a third person perspective.  You hold the remote horizontally and use the d-pad and a couple of buttons for the majority of the game.  But, the game producers forgot that the gaming world is largely in 3D now so a little directional pad with only four directions doesn't quite let you do everything you need to do.  Like walking diagonally, for example.  Or dodging enemies.  To be fair, the designers tried to introduce a Matrix-style dodging technique complete with special killing blows, all of which sounds cool and sounds classic considering how Samus would always be doing multiple flips in mid-air and jumping off walls in the older 2-D games.  But in this game the Matrix-style moves are not an option, they are a requirement.  Some enemies take a very long time to kill without these killing blows, and because this is a 3D game every time you try to dodge you are going to be facing the wrong direction.  This is because the dodging is all done on the D-Pad which is also how you move and change direction.  That's right, you have to press the D-Pad in the right direction at the right moment to dodge because walking won't get you out of the line of fire fast enough.  You can still change directions during these dodges, which means that if you do so unintentionally (very easy with a d-pad) you will not be facing your enemy, a big problem if you intend on actually killing your enemy quickly.  Don't rely on the auto-targeting either; because the game is 3D with 2D controls the designers included an auto-aim feature, which doesn't always do the logical thing (target the closest enemy you are facing).  You'll be doing more dodging than you really want to.  What's worse, there is no control to allow you to center the camera behind Samus--you will be ambushed because of that and you will take a lot of damage because of that ambushing.To be brief about the voice acting, the narrations are bland and the lines for the cutscenes are not at all what you would expect from a bounty hunter who has just spent the past few years helping the war effort, and had spent many years before that on her own as a bounty hunter.  You would expect Samus to be blunt, terse or maybe even rude.  Instead she is quiet and unnaturally polite, not to mention verbose.  Not what you would expect from someone whose CO basically let her burn on the station rather than turn on her temperature protection suit...Which brings us to Samus as a character.  As mentioned we would expect Samus to be tough and more than willing to bend the rules if she thinks she needs to because that' what she did in almost every other game.  But for the duration of the game, Samus just does whatever Malkovich asks; most of the cinemas (remember that they are usually 20 minutes or longer, and you can't skip) become soap operas of Samus's past.  Samus is depicted as being sensitive in this game, which is normal for a human being but her sensitivity is so extreme that it gets in the way--literally.  At one point she confronts Ridley and goes into a panic attack that prevents her from fighting.  But any Metroid fan will remember that by this point in the Metroid timeline Samus has fought Ridley a grand total of five (5) times without panicking in the slightest...  Why this time, I don't know.  It makes no sense, and the warrior who has always managed to conquer her fears in the face of death suddenly can't fight back...  I'm sorry, but the designers destroyed Samus as a character.  To be emotional is normal, but if you can be reduced to a crying, blubbering mass instantly odds are you aren't a bounty hunter who has just spent the past few years in the middle of a war.Samus is also unrealistic physically, which of course leads to sexploitation.  Everyone who has ever seen gameplay scenes from a Metroid game would have to admit that Samus is extremely athletic, almost gymnastically so.  In this game, however, there are numerous cutscenes of Samus in her Zero-Suit (so form fitting that it might as well be called a birthday suit) and you can tell she's very well... endowed around the waist and the bosom.  Compare that to a real athletic woman (especially a gymnast) and you will know that something is wrong; there is no justification for her physical design as a character, and you have to ask yourself why the programmers designed her this way.  Considering her figure and just how tight her suit I am tempted to say her design borders on the pornographic.  I would definitely urge parents to think twice before letting their children play this game.  Samus is not a warrior in this game, she's a pin-up girl.In many ways Samus is the game, and in this game she just is not believable.  She's not the tough, independent character we expect given her circumstances and personal history, she's a submissive quasi-crybaby.  Furthermore, giving her long monologues and cutscenes was a big risk on the part of the game designers, one that did not pay off; they not only damaged her character but damaged the genre altogether.  Keeping Samus quiet in the other titles let you feel involved; you didn't just control Samus, you were Samus.  That was why Metroid was always so much fun.  But in this game, you're not Samus anymore.  Instead you're just watching her, usually in cutscenes that go on and on.  There isn't much fun in cutscenes, which is why most serious gamers skip each and every one.",NOPE.

Sad to say, The Other M did not live up to expectations.  If this were  an anime movie, it might appeal to fans but as a game, it is simply a dud.  I was very disappointed with the third person viewpoint for the majority of play.  It's confusing to switch back and forth from that to first person only for shooting/attacking.  Why they wanted to change it from the great first person shooter perspective of the previous games is beyond me.  The graphics were more colorful but other than the ""movies"" weren't really much more impressive than Metroid 3.  There was just too much drama and not enough action.  Metroid fans aren't in it for the story of lost loves or past life tragedies.  We want a challenge to face, a puzzle to solve, a creature to kill.  That is what has made the Metroid franchise so great.  It keeps you on your toes until the last boss is killed.  The Other M is long and boring with too many cuts for the movie sequences.

    Nintendo",1,"I'll start this review with a caveat:  I am an enormous Metroid fan.  I've played and beaten literally every Metroid game with the exception of the first two for the NES.  I love the style, the atmospheric storytelling, Samus as a strong female character - it's a very beloved series to me.Team Ninja ruined the name of Metroid with Other M.I'll break this down.Graphics:I have to hand it to them, graphically, this is an amazing looking game.  It's smooth and polished, from the pre-rendered CG cutscenes to the in-game graphics.Unfortunately, that's about all there is that's good about this game.Level Design:I loved exploring the worlds of Metroid: deep jungles, dark caverns, flying cities...  And I hated Team Ninja's Bottle Ship (the spaceship upon which the entirety of Other M takes place).  For the first half hour, I was quite nervous about the level design, as I was running down long hallway after long hallway.  What kind of spaceship consists entirely of long, empty, metallic hallways?  Then I got to a jungle area, and my fears were eased - but only briefly.  I quickly became enraged as I discovered that literally 90% of the rooms have one entrance, and one exit.  If you are not LITERALLY running down a hallway, then you are almost always still FUNCTIONALLY doing so - your goal is to move from one end of the room to another, in the exact means that Team Ninja wants you to.  Time after time again I had to look up walkthroughs online because I could NOT figure out how I was to progress - all too often, it was because of a morph ball opening was tucked away in some corner of the room, almost impossible to see unless you already knew where to look.Which brings me to my next point..Gameplay mechanics:Okay, the running around vs. first-person switching actually wasn't too horrible.What WAS horrible was every time you encounter a story-specific mini-game that I'll call ""Find the pixel.""  I call this ""find the pixel"" because at various points in the story, you'll be forced into first-person mode and your goal will be to find in the environment a story-related clue... except that these clues are hidden deep in the environment and you literally have to focus your cursor DIRECTLY over the pixel that Team Ninja has decreed to be the target.Example (mild spoilers, but really I'm just saving you some frustration): One of these moments happens in a grassy clearing.  Your ultimate target is alien blood.  Sounds straightforward, right?  Wrong.  The alien blood is GREEN.  GREEN BLOOD IN A GRASSY CLEARING.  Thanks, Team Ninja, for wasting 10 minutes of my life on that asinine moment, as I rotated around and around, scouring the environment for the clue.Oh, also, in previous Metroids I loved finding upgrades and becoming more and more powerful.  That's nonexistent here, as Samus starts off with all of her powers, but decides that she needs authorization from her superiors to use them.  That sounds ok... except when you're burning to death in lava and your superior refuses to give you authorization to unlock your Varia Suit.This method of unlocking occurs for every single power... except one.  They do NOT tell you that that power is unlocked, and Team Ninja expects you that in the throes of Samus dying, you are to suddenly feel inspired to attempt to use a power that has never been authorized - and to remember how to use it from the tutorial, which you probably played through more than 10 hours ago.Oh, also, there are less than a dozen primary enemy types.  You'll spend almost the entire game fighting slight variations of the exact same enemies.  Fun!Music:The music for this game is practically nonexistent.  The majority of the game will play 30-second loops of ambient noise.  The cutscenes will employ sweeping orchestrated music that swells at the cheesiest moments, making it impossible to take what's occurring on-screen seriously.  But then again, that's probably not even possible, because:Story/Character Development:The story in Metroid: Other M is the single worst story I've ever experienced tied to a mainline Nintendo franchise.  It has glaring plotholes, horrible prose, and poor voice acting.  Remember the baby Metroid from Super Metroid?  In an effort to jam down our throats that Samus has maternal instincts, Team Ninja has her refer to that Metroid as ""the baby"" almost 20 times within the first 5 minutes of the game.  It's nauseating.  If I get attached to a puppy, I don't constantly refer to it as ""a baby.""  It's a puppy.  I'm going to call it a puppy.  Ergo, IT'S A METROID.  CALL IT THAT.The translation was of the text was good, in that the vocabulary is sophisticated and that there are no grammatical errors.  Other than that, it was horrific.  The dialogue sounded as if it were written by a highly intelligent 14-year-old who writes vampire fanfiction in his spare time - overly dramatic, gauche, maudlin, and inappropriate.A key line, delivered by a Galactic Federation official: ""Samus, you're forbidden from using Power Bombs.  They're dangerous against living things.  That's a nice way of saying they can vaporize humans!""..... Excuse me?  Whoever wrote that needs to be struck in the face with a copy of Ender's Game.  Or Neuromancer.  Or any piece of science fiction worth reading.In sum:The gameplay mechanics are acceptable. However, the level design is excruciatingly boring, the joy of upgrading Samus' abilities are completely forgone for the sake of a laughable Authorization mechanic, and the story - the very reason you are playing the game - is wretched.To those who say, ""You just don't like a story-heavy Metroid!""  No, all Metroid games have story, especially the Prime series.  They simply employ atmospheric storytelling devices - skillfully - instead of forcing you to watch laughable cutscene after cutscene unfold.To those who say, ""I loved the development of the human side of Samus, seeing her vulnerabilities!"" - If you mean to say you liked seeing a strong, independent, highly intelligent female character reduced to a maudlin, overly emotional cliche that has absolutely no resemblance to her actions as established by the Metroid franchise... then that's your own prerogative.I will never buy another Team Ninja game again.",Are you a fan of the Metroid series?  Then don't buy this game.

    Nintendo",1,"I bought this game with an open mind,knowing that it was going to be different from others in the series.I don't mind that,I don't mind change in a series such as this, I view it as a good thing assuming it is done well.So when I read negative things about this game, I erroneously assumed that it was just die-hard fans of the series that just couldn't accept the change, and that their bias led them to overlook a good game.I was wrong.Very wrong; The game just isn't that good.The game starts with some very nicely rendered FMV scenes complete with voice acting (barring comparatively minor sound bites, this is the first Nintendo game to feature voice acting, meaning it has an actual script) however the voice acting is average at best in the game,bordering on horrible for certain characters.Without spoiling too much, Samus answers a distress signal from a space station, and while there happens upon her old buddies from her squad in the galactic federation, including her former commander.These are terrible characters with no personality,as well as being so unbelievably generic as to be indistinguishable form one another, except of course the black guy and the asian guy, who are so stereotypical it's laughable.In past Metroid games,as you explored the world(s),you would find along the way,various upgrades,namely new beams for Samus' arm-cannon,grappling hook,as well as upgrades to her suit itself.This was a staple of the games as well as the characteristic music that would play when you found those items.That's where this game falls apart completely.This game throws away that classic colleciton aspect, in favor of a premise so outrageously stupid and contrived that it completely spoils the game and casts a veil of absurdity over the whole thing.It is This:As you arrive on the spaceship,and meet up with your old gang,it is made apparent through a cut scene that the commander has authority over Samus,who has all her abilities available to her, but she agrees to only use them as he authorizes them,and accordingly they are dispensed every so often as their immediate need arises.This is is just a horrible idea that is executed even worse.Samus is always fighting somehting in this game so why wouldn't she want to be well equipped, and why wouldn't her commander want her to be well equipped?Even more ridiculous yet is you must await authorization of the Varia suit which serves no purpose other than to protect Samus from extreme heat in the lava areas. So she wont turn on a feature to prevent her flesh from melting just because it isn't authorized.Among the game are other examples of that nature. I know it doesn't really effect the gameplay really, but as I said earlier it paints the game in such a ridiculous light that it's very hard for me to get over it.Onto the controls:In the 3rd person perspective aspects, you hold the Wii remote sideways, which actually works very well, considering you are using a 2 pad to control Samus in 3d.Her movements are very fluid and easy to pull off which is nice.However that is only half the game, the other half is first person.At any given time when you flip the controller and point it at the screen, it shifts into a first person view from Samus' perspective.You can aim up and down and 360 degrees but you can't move around, as if her feet were cememented to the spot.This actually works well alot of the time, allowing for a unique novelty.Unfortunately there are other times where the action is just way too frenzied and there are too many enemies around for this to be practical and I found myself taking damage during the switch because there just wasn't enough time to aim and fire.Also for some ridiculous reason you can only use missles in first person.There are some  very annoying segments that bothered me alot; one of them is when you finish a cutscene, you will sometimes be locked into first person mode, and you can't move until you find a particular object and scan it, sometimes it is so particular it is almost impossible to find.Another is that occasionally there are some 3rd person segments which do not control like the rest of the game; the camera zooms up behind Samus, and her speed is reduced to a crawl; she may not jump or shoot even.Just walk around.These segments are wholly unnecessary and why the developers included them at all is a mystery to me.The sad thing is that those problems aside, the game is great. It's very fast paced and the action is excellent, and the graphics, while certainly not the best, can be very vivid and pleasant to look at, with some very pretty areas.The music is somewhat bland I guess but it never becomes annoying.The tragedy is that had the things I complained about been removed, as well as with perhaps scrapping the first person view altogether, this would have been a really great game, but with them, it's basically unplayable.","Would have been a good game, but several horrible design choices render this title unplayable."

This game is just disapointing, you might like it more than I do, hell you might love the game like some people do, but alot of fans know, this game is just not a good metroid game...at all! The exploration and atmosphere is mostly gone so the game and the game is just a stupidly easy action game while can be fun at times, is just really mindnumbing at most. This games story is garbage, I can go in depth, but that would take a while, Samus is terribly portrayed, all she ever does is monologue about things, whines, constantly mentions the baby metroid and adam, repeat, there is nothing good about her character in this game. I will just leave it at that honestly, that is all you really need to know, I would avoid this game.

    Nintendo",2,"*Introduction*The Metroid series is one of Nintendo's finest, and the new entry, Metroid: Other M, is finally here. After the excellent first person Metroid Prime series by Retro was concluded, it was announced that Metroid was returning to both third person view and Japanese development. Many fans were made uneasy when it was announced that Team Ninja would be heavily involved in the project, but the fact that it was being headed by Yoshio Sakamoto, who has been heavily involved with Metroid from the beginning, gave hope that the game would live up to its classic name. Sakamoto promised that this game would flesh out Samus's character as the most story heavy Metroid yet, but has this decision ultimately backfired?*Story*The story is the most controversial aspect of this game. Rather than opt for the minimalist approach of the other titles in the series, Metroid: Other M inserts a full blown Final Fantasy XIII style cinematic experience. The story begins with a recap of the events that took place in Super Metroid's final moments and leads into Samus receiving a distress signal from a space station called ""the bottle ship."" She arrives to find out that the Galactic Federation has already sent a squad of soldiers, led by her old commanding officer Adam Malkovich. She ultimately joins up with them and politely agrees to follow Adam's orders.The most jarring aspect of the story is the way it fleshes out the character of Samus.  While Samus has had spoken lines before in Metroid: Fusion, but they were never overly intrusive and didn't reveal a whole lot about her. However, in Other M, she not only talks, she talks a lot. For a series that has largely lived on letting the player form their own ideas about the character of Samus, this is a bit disconcerting.  The personality she reveals as she narrates the storyline is bound to infuriate many fans who have long seen Samus as a stoic and strong individual who is in control of her emotions.Throughout the game, Samus has many flashbacks to her time in the Galactic Federation with Adam which portray her as an insecure little girl who has trouble handling the fact that she's a woman in a man's world. From giving a thumbs down as a salute, to her monologues about how father figure Adam is the only one who understands her, this becomes cheesy and embarrassing to watch. Back on the bottle ship Samus continues to act submissive to Adam as she instantly agrees to disable all of her abilities at his request with zero hesitation. Later on in the game, there's a scene where Samus is so frozen in fear that she is unable to do anything. Samus comes across as insecure, uncertain, and even submissive at times.Watching the story play out, it is incredibly difficult to believe that this could be the same bounty hunter who has courageously saved the galaxy on numerous occasions. In an attempt to make Samus more human and relatable, Other M goes overboard. It's one thing to have emotions. It's another thing to be crippled by them to the point of endangering lives. For a game series that has never had a lot of story and never really needed one, I have to question why the game creators felt the need to insert this melodramatic poorly plotted mess.  The story is a major part of the game, and since you can't skip cut scenes, it is impossible to ignore.Once you complete the game, a cinema mode unlocks where you can re-watch all of the cut-scenes strung together like a movie. Whether you'd want to is another story.*Gameplay*The gameplay in M:oM is also a controversial element. Other M opts to use only the Wii pointer and nothing else for control. You hold it sideways like a NES controller leaving only the d-pad and two buttons for input. If you want to fire a missile, you have to rotate the Wii remote so it is pointing at the screen, which changes the perspective to first person. This shift is rather awkward, and you can't move while you are in this view aside from an awkward dodge maneuver accomplished by quickly shifting the pointer off the side of the screen. The controls aren't broken, but they are not particularly good, either. They work, but only just.The game itself plays more like an action game than a Metroid game. Almost all of the exploration you would expect from the series is gone, and for the vast majority of the game you are restricted to a linear path where doors will often lock behind you to prevent revisiting previous areas. There are some hidden missile expansions and energy tanks along the way, but the game pretty much tells you their exact position once you clear a room of enemies. The game only opens up to allow free exploration at the very end. This exploration makes it very clear why they decided to restrict the main story line so much, because when you have a few options of where to go, every other area is ""now loading"" for ten seconds, especially when you use the speed booster.The combat in this game is very easy. Due to the limitations of using a digital control pad in 3d space, Other M includes a dodge move that occurs automatically when you are pressing a direction on the d-pad. This means you will almost never get hit by anything as long as you are moving around. Samus's gun also auto-aims, so most of the time you can just shoot blindly down a corridor and not worry about whether or not you hit anything. The only challenge comes from shifting to first person to fire a missile, which is only required for boss fights the majority of the time. This is more annoying and awkward than difficult, since it merely involves waiting until you have a large enough window of time to get a missile off without getting hit.Throughout the game, Adam restricts the use of Samus's abilities until he deems them necessary, which means no more finding your abilities along the way, and also leads to illogical moments such as Adam not deciding it was appropriate to authorize the Varia suit to protect Samus from heat damage until she is already most of the way through the lava sector taking heavy heat damage along the way. This approach also means that there are no substantial new powerups for Samus to acquire. All of the significant abilities Samus has in this game are repeats from Super Metroid.Also worth noting are frustrating sequences that involve freezing you in the first person perspective until you find some tiny hard to find object. Often you will pass the Wii cursor directly over the object you are supposed to examine without the game registering it, leading to a lot of time wasted passing over everything over and over in an attempt to find what you are meant to scan. These moments completely kill the pacing of the game.*Replay Value*After you complete the game, every door unlocks, and you are finally completely free to finish your collecting spree of leftover expansions. At this point, there is also an extra boss and epilogue sequence to find. However, this can all be done in less than twelve hours the first time through, and once you do, the only reason to replay the game is the hard mode that unlocks upon 100% completion. There is also a cinema mode and art gallery that unlocks. If you don't care about getting everything, a regular main story play-through only lasts around eight hours.*Graphics*The graphics look pretty good for a Wii game, but the actual art design is lacking. The game is filled with generic looking hallways and rooms that don't really stand out visually, and the themes never go beyond the typical generic fire, ice, and jungle areas. The only thing that stands out about them is the holographic effect that appears sometimes to remind you that these are only simulations on a space station. One high point of the visuals is that the animations are some of the most fluid I've seen on the Wii.*Sound*One of the most disappointing aspects of Metroid: Other M is that the game has almost no music during actual game play. The background noise consists mostly ambient sounds and, very rarely, one or two recycled tunes from past Metroid games.  Expansions are also missing the familiar tune that used to play when you picked them up in other Metroid games. This is a very disappointing aspect of the game. The voice acting is alright, but it's not spectacular. Samus sounds monotone throughout the game and you'll be hearing her a lot. The sound effects for weapons and enemies are adequate.*Overall*In more ways than one, this game is a massive disappointment. The game is playable, but in a series as outstanding as Metroid, it sticks out like a sore thumb, and even taken on its own terms it fails to impress.",Metroid: Other Movie - A Lifetime Channel Original

    Nintendo",2,"CONCEPT:Metroid: Other M is an action-adventure game that feels very toned down compared to the standard of quality many long time fans of the series have become accustomed to.Taking place right after the events of Super Metroid, Other M is intended to give players an in-depth look at Samus Arans mysterious past from her subjective and strangely childish perspective.GRAPHICS:The best part of the game is easily the stunning visuals, I couldn't believe I was playing on the wii. The cutscenes look fantastic and the level designs looked great despite their redundancies. However many of the bosses and enemies did not appear very convincing.SOUND DESIGN:Annoying footsteps that were incredibly repetitous, I know this seems picky of me but seriously I'm not exaggerating. The music is virtually absent and non-existent, it's just eerie ambience. The voice acting has been getting a lot of flack from critics too... and rightfully so it is emotionless and tedious.CONTROLS:Switching to first-person to shoot missiles is clumsy and painfully avoided whenever possible, I never once purposely chose to fire missles. There are also moments in the game where the first person perspective is forced upon you and you must find a point on the screen to initiate a cutscene. This part is very unintuitive and unless you are aware you're actually supposed to be finding some specific thing you may spend 10 minutes of your life waving the wii remote like a magic wand that transforms a horrible game into a fun one (good luck).ENTERTAINMENT:Well as a huge fan of the metroid series I definitely couldn't miss this one, and if you're a fan I would say it is still worth a play through. BUT it is not in any way shape or form comparable to any metroid game from the past.,REPLAY VALUE:ModerateAfter the ""first ending"" You can search the space station with the power ups you do posses to find the ones you didn't before ""beating the game""But... no thank you, ooh ooh you can also watch all the cut scenes together like one looooooong movie... most of them were unbearable the first time through so yeah I'll pass on that too.OVERALLThe potential is definitely there in this game, but Project M (team Ninja + x Nintendo) fumbled the ball in an attempt at appealling to a broader audience. When you consider the standard that Retro studios and the Prime series left the franchise with this game is just a completely inexcusable failure.It's not challenging by any means, there is no free roaming or chance of getting lost, there are no substantial power ups to be discovered, all of the enemies are the same they just look different and worst of all you are not even alone on a desolate planet... to me I never even felt like I was playing a metroid game.To be fair I really wanted to like this game, I really did... but I had a hard time even playing and finishing it. I appreciate Project M trying to reimagine the direction of the franchise but now personally I'm afraid this may damage their chances at receiving adequate funds for a future release, because I seriously doubt this game sold anywhere near as well as the Prime series had.FINAL RATING : 4.5/10",Mother....Time to go

    Nintendo",1,"The title sums up my sentiments for this game.  A lot of other reviews focus on faults in the plot, a distaste for cutscenes and voice acting, or how this particular installment deviates from traditional Metroid games in a bad way.  Regardless of all that, I think this game is just plain boring.  Every enemy encounter is the same, boss or non-boss; dodge to instantly charge your beam and then fire.  If your beam stops working, shoot missiles.  A few encounters required the grappling beam, but that's it.  Furthermore, the levels are really uninspired.  You can just run straight through them.  There's little room for exploration and even the dang pick-ups are highlighted on the map so you don't have to search for those.  I beat the game with only 36% of the pickups with ease, and did it in under 7 hours on my first and only playthrough.  I went and did the extra chapter at the end in less than an hour and that was mostly getting more pickups (I got up to ~50-60%).  If you get 100% you can unlock hard mode, but by that point I just really didn't care anymore.  Do yourself a favor and save your money for a different game.  There are lots of good titles coming out in the next couple months.  If you need something to do in the meantime find an old classic title and go replay it.",Boring

    Nintendo",2,"Look i want every newcomer who has heard of Metriod to understand that this is a classic series next to Zelda,Mario etc and they had excellent remakes. And Metriod other M was sopposed to be no exception because of how legendary the fanbase is and the fact that everybody waited years since the gamecube release(which was not bad at all really). Let us go further on to the point and explain why you should skip Metriod other M, and instead buy the classic gamecube version(15 dollars) and the SNES for WII Virtual console(15 dollars) besides you can play Metriod from gamecube on the WII.I played the whole entire game, there were 5 of the same enemy types the WHOLE ENTIRE GAME, which means all the enemies were generic in the fact that you travel through each element and it is the same monster painted differently but they use different elements which could give it replayability but in essence falls short due to lack of variation OF enemies.Last but not least is the cutscenes with robotic dialougue and uninspired voice acting which did not make me want to listen after playing for the first hour and a hafl. Also what will make most of the Metriod community mad is the fact you have to wait until you are authorized to use some of your weapons, yes you heard me right, AUTHORIZED because in the beginning Samus joins forces with the galactic police and the head officer has to authorize even though Samus is a lone bounty hunter. But the reason is because somehow there are hidden items and he needs to restrict you over time until he authorizes it.Nice try Team Ninja, no offense, but you RUINED this game, you are not clever, and you owe the gaming world an apology. Excellent graphics and good diolugue do not get you anywhere with this series, this is METRIOD. The fans desearved better than this, and of course this will get alot of sales because of the LOYALTY fans have, but fans will realize that this is Team Ninja's fault for not putting enough effort into different enemies, bad controls etc. All i can tell Team Ninja or anybody in their staff is to go back to making Ninja Gaiden and Dead Or Alive those are the only games you guys are auctully above average on.Also to Nintendo, they should have let Silicon Knights do a remake, or a sequel down the road, they certainly did a great job with Metal Gear Solid Twin Snakes(Technically a remake) for the gamecube.

    Nintendo",2,"After Retro Studios gave 3 good installments in the Metroid Prime Series, Nintendo took ahold of the reigns again.  This was a mistake.  Nintendo has this ""it's broken and we must fix it,"" mentality.  Well, if it isn't broken why fix it?  I didn't mind the Ninja Gaiden-like gameplay (Team Ninja was involved in development) or the fact it was in 3rd person once again.  The first-person controls are simply used to look around and fire missiles while stationary.  Since this is the only way to fire missiles, this got on my nerves.Samus is a strong protagonist character-at least she was anyway.  In Metroid Other M, she is stricken with high-running emotions that are totally out of character for her.  She has an anxiety attack fighting Ridley!?  C'mon now, how out-of-touch with this series is Nintendo?  Samus is constantly reflecting on her actions and on her life, making the whole story far too introspective and melodramatic.  You can't even collect new weapons.  Her old Commander has to allow her access to her own abilities as you progress in the story.  While this may be a logical approach to her powering up during the story, it doesn't feel exciting to simply wait to get to use the same equipment over again.It was playable, I won't say I didn't beat it.  The gameplay was mostly enjoyable, except for a few buggy camera angles.  The musical score was well done, I have to admit.  I have been a Metroid fan from the beginning and while I did have some fun playing I was ultimately let down by this one.  Hopefully, Retro will pick the series back up off the ground and dust it off for Nintendo once again.",Metroid fans may be in for a shock

    Nintendo",2,"I am a huge Metroid fan now and have been from the NES glory days. I'm not a fan of FPS games but still tried the Metroid Prime series and wasn't disappointed at all.The other M is a different take on the Metroid series and a pretty interesting one at that. We all have our opinion as to why Samus was the way she was based on past games, and of course past games have kind of cemented a persona in our minds as to who she was too. However, we all have a past, and experiences and people we come in contact with have all played a part in making us who we are now, whether we like it or not. The story may not have played out the way we would have envisioned and it may not be as flashy as we would have liked but you must remember every story has a beginning and in this case a lot of surprises. Samus didn't come out in a diapers and an arm cannon on her arm LOL. I've also heard a lot of complaints about the story in regard to her using her weapons, but you have to understand as unrealistic as it may sound certain allowances need to be made to make the game playable.The controls are very different than most games to say the least, and does take time to get used to, however once you do it's manageable but far from perfect.My advice, avoid this game if you're a Metroid fan, because you will be let down.I'm not sure of my Wii number, and truthfully no reason really to remember it.

    Nintendo",1,"Upon Other M's unveiling at E3 2009 I was torn. On one hand, I thought a cutscene, story oriented direction ala Metroid Fusion was a bad place to take the franchise that contrasted with the series' fundamentals too much. On the other hand, I'm a fan of action games, so I could forgive Other M being a poor Metroid if the game played well. Little did I know it doesn't even do that.Sure, it plays functionally, and you can get to start to finish without too much trouble. Unfortunately, that's the most that can be said about the game. The gameplay itself lacks any satisfaction due to the ridiculous amount of handholding present. No longer do you need to time or aim your shots. Simply face your target, shoot, and the auto aim system will ensure you hit your target. The dodge mechanic is also ridiculously simplified, again removing any need for timing. Simply mash the control pad, and Samus will fluidly dodge any oncoming attacks to no compromise. Perhaps you're not interested in a fleshed out combat system in Metroid.What about the adventure, the exploration, the atmosphere? They seem to be glossed by in lieu of telling an 'epic story'. No longer will you get lost in an alien environment. Instead, you will progress a spaceship at the command of Adam Malkovich. The problem is twofold. First, you're constantly being told where to go, and backtracking is made impossible due to doors magically closing behind you so if your idea of Metroid is exploration you can throw that out the window. Secondly, the spaceship is just a bland, unimaginative setting. There are simulated environments (forest land, fire land, ice land, is this Zelda?) to mix things up, but given they feel like nothing more than overused tropes. Perhaps most importantly, the music, frankly, is just bad. There are none of the creepy, atmospheric songs the series has become beloved for. Nothing but ambient noises that could very well be 30 second loops. To the game's credit, I did find some joy deviating from the game's rails in search of some of the power ups. Unfortunately, the satisfaction in obtainingthem was heavily diminished due to the lack of necessity thanks to the Other M's simplified gameplay.About that 'epic story'. I won't say much, but boy, it is bad. So bad that I can see James Rolfe of AVGN fame reviewing it twenty years from now if he's still doing that gig. Overly long cutscenes, bad dialogue, one dimensional characters, and plot twists that throw off everyone's preconceived notions about a certain iconic character. It's got it all.I can't recommend this game to any fan of the series. If you're insistent on playing it (as I was), I suggest doing more research and at the very most renting it so Nintendo won't be excused trying to pass off this joke as a ""true return to classic Metroid"".",Neither a good Metroid nor a good game

    Nintendo",1,"If you've ever had the pleasure of playing Super Metroid on the SNES, The Metroid Prime series on Gamecube and Wii, Metroid: Zero Mission and Fusion on the GBA or any of the other great games in the Metroid series, you are no doubt familiar with the concept of ""fun"".  Well, I'm here to tell you that ""Metroid Other M"" is the exact opposite of that.  Words can't describe just how much I truly hate this game.Let me just start by saying that this is the most disappointing entry in the Metroid series by a long shot.  That is a given.  Even the nut-busting difficulty of Metroid Prime 2 is no match for the abomination that is ""Metroid Other M"".  I pre-ordered this game assuming how incredible it would be as has been the case with every Metroid game that has preceded it.  Shame on me.  This is the first game in the series I considered abandoning and selling promptly while it still had a high resale value because I was having ZERO fun with it.The biggest offender of ""Metroid Other M"" is the controls.  They are ""clunky"" to put it mildly.  Why you are forced to use the Wii remote only-with it's hobbit sized control pad, is beyond me.  Why no nunchuck control?  We've been using this crazy little thing called an ""analog stick"" for well over a decade now with good reason.  My left thumb would often protest after even the shortest bouts of slogging through this game.  it's pretty much like using your entire hand to operate a door bell.  Also,  the forced switch between 2d and 3d by moving the remote is awkward at best and completely jarring at worst.  It doesn't work.  Fail on Team Ninja, fail on Nintendo.  This is the sloppiest control scheme I've seen on a Wii game for some time now.  And considering the sheer amount of garbage games available on Wii-that's really saying something.  Also, certain segments of the game were just plain clumsy.  Climbing up elevator shafts for instance was an unnecessary chore.  Not because it was difficult mind you, but because 90% of the time you can't make a jump without falling down a few rungs.  No matter how many times you try, you can't connect the jump-then all of the sudden it works, even though you didn't do a thing differently.The next ""Other M"" offense is the graphics.  I know some reviewers have commented on Other M's ""great graphics"".  Surely they must be referring to the cinematic scenes (which really are great) or the graphics of Samus and the Federation officers themselves, because everything else in this game looks like puke.  The environments in ""Other M"" are uninspired, flat and ""ugly"" looking atrocities that probably wouldn't have looked good even in the N64 days.  The bosses (besides Ridley) are also very uninspired and weak.  The Metroid queen for instance looks like something out of ""Ocarina of Time"" circa 1998.  Even the original Metroid Prime for gamecube which has eight years on ""Other M"" runs circles around it in the graphics department.  Even for a Wii game, this game is truly ugly.Offense number 3 is game play.  First off, the enemies just aren't fun to kill.  They don't leave bits of health behind for you to collect either.  I was amazed at just how much I missed this small detail-but just like most of Metroid's other hallowed trademarks, this too has been unceremoniously dumped from the experience.  The game play is also linear to a fault.  No more serious exploring folks.  Exploration is discouraged in Other M which pretty much goes against the grain of the entire Metroid series.  No more unlocking weapons.  No more colored doors.  It's all scripted and you are shoved from room to room with your ability to explore and find secrets all but taken from you.  Activating your weapons because ""Adam"" finally allows you is a ridiculous gaming device.  This just smacks of lazy game development.  Was progression through the discovery of new weapons too much to ask of team ninja?  I guess just like everything else associated with Nintendo this generation though (outside of maybe the Mario Galaxy series), cutting corners is the name of the game.You may want to skip this next offense, as it has no bearing on the experience-it is just a personal quip.  It concerns the art direction.  What happened to Metroid?  This game bears very little visual resemblance what-so-ever to the Metroid series outside of Samus herself.  That in and of itself is not necessarily a bad thing in gaming as the same can be said for ""The Legend of Zelda: Windwaker"" when compared to the rest of the Zelda series.  However, unlike that game-this game doesn't even feel like it's part of the same universe.  It's such a complete variation of the Metroid cannon-and the creatures here just don't seem to fit visually at all with what we know of the Metroid series.  It would be like putting Jar Jar Binks into The Lord of the Rings.  The universes just don't jive for me.  But like I said, that is more of a personal gripe-it's nothing that affects the gaming experience.Overall, I found the whole ""Other M"" experience a completely un-fun drag.  I slogged through this game and even played the epilogue only to justify my investment in pre-ordering it.  Trust me though, the minute I finished, I literally went to my computer and listed it on amazon in the used games section.  This will be the last time I pre-order a Nintendo game without playing it first.  I've never been burned by Nintendo before given their track record, but this game was pathetic on just about every level.  Boo and hiss to the biggest dud in Metroid history.  Fail.",Epic fail

    Nintendo",2,"I admit, I held off on this one after all the bad press and waited to snag it at a discount. Glad I did, as while it isn't as terrible as some let on, if I had paid full price for this game I would have felt cheated. It is shiny and slick, but any relation this game has to the Metroid mythos is pretty paltry. Stick any other character in there instead of Samus and it wouldn't have made much difference; the bounty hunter is pretty much gone here and it's kinda just a soap opera in space. The gameplay itself is just OK and you can get the hang of it pretty quickly; then just rinse/repeat to the end (dodge, shoot, dodge, and over and over). Much prefer the Metroid Prime series and that's the one I'll continue to replay in the future; this one will probably just sit on the shelf and may end up next to the other two or three I've seen at my local Goodwill (not kidding on this last).",Not sure how this one got through quality control

    Nintendo",1,"Quite what anyone was thinking when this was greenlighted is beyond me, as what resulted was a game which no Metroid fan could fail to hate, and which from a more objective view has little to nothing to offer which another game hasn't done better.From a Metroid perspective, the game is a brutal slap in the face. In the game in which the decision was made to expand on Samus' backstory, little consistency in story or characters is to be had throughout, and players of any other Metroid titles will be quick to note the numerous flagrant inconsistencies with previous games. Moreover, story is often used as an element to limit exploration and player action rather than expanding it over the game; this includes arbitrarily locking doors that limit where the player can go with no real explanation, unlocking upgrades because an unlikeable character gives Samus permission to do so (when she already had it), and even worse. It's hard not to hate every character's guts and the story a short while into the game.Gameplay wise the adventure becomes quite linear, losing replay value, killing the exploration that made previous games successful. Even non-Metroid fans will soon become bored with being spoon-fed every acquirable item. The upgrades themselves add little to the overall gameplay, and are altogether too incremental to maintain novelty. Though environments are decently rendered and composed, lack of camera angle control prevents detracts from this, and the simple fact is that the Prime games clearly look more fleshed out in most regards.Combat could have been compelling, and brought new fast-paced action to the series. Unfortunately, combat ultimately boils down to repeatedly mashing the directional pad to automatically dodge attacks and unleash a counter, and the choice to eschew both a lock-on system and a useful manual aiming during normal run and gun mode means even more control is taken away from the player as the game takes over aiming in large part. An awkward first person mode for missile aiming and scanning forces the player to stand still and inevitably take hits, though at least the transition is relatively seamless. The end result is a repetitive combat experience which quickly becomes tedious, and is altogether too easy to finish.Overall, what we are left with it a game which can barely stand on its own and account of terrible story and surprisingly boring gameplay, and which fails to carry forward any of the good aspects of the series it purports to be a part of.","A travesty of gaming, and a disgrace to the Metroid series"

    Nintendo",1,"Metroid Other M makes Metroid Prime 2 seem like an amazing game in comparison (and that game was a major disappointment). This game was awful and it had some of the worst controls and the most eye straining gameplay mechanics I've ever experienced. The entire game is played using only the Wii Mote. No joypad from the nunchuk, no plugging in a classic or GameCube controller, only the Wii mote and its awful dpad played sideways. The thing barely fits in my adult male sized hands.There are times when you have to turn the Wii Mote around to aim it at the screen just to shoot at certain types of enemies that the game decided could only be shot by pointing the Wii Mote at the screen. And being that the Wii Mote barely aims properly, you can imagine how annoying this was. All of the other enemies in the game could be shot by simply pressing the shoot button while holding the Wii Mote sideways, no strategy, no skill needed, the game auto aims and shoots the enemies for you when you press the shoot button (one of the only 2 buttons used for gameplay, jump and shoot). This took away any chance the game could've possibly had at being fun.The navigation through the buildings was so unbelievably confusing and you couldn't go back to certain areas after you've left them because the game wouldn't allow you to. Unlike in every other Metroid game where you could explore almost every area as often as you wanted.Another annoying thing was having to fight side by side with some kind of galactic federation team. Instead of fighting as a solo bounty hunter like in every other Metroid game. This game was terrible and I was barely able to sit through more than 5 hours of gameplay before my head started to hurt.I can't express how thankful I am for being able to sell this game, along with my Wii and everything I bought for it (immediately after I bought them) before I knew how crappy it all turned out to be. The game sucked, the graphics were GameCube standard, the cutscenes were stupid and they took the Metroid storyline into directions that I didn't want it to go in.",This is the worst Metroid game to date

    Nintendo",2,"I want to add to the pool of metroid fans unimpressed with this title. I tried really hard to like this game, its Metroid after all and who is cooler than Samus? Unfortunately, for me this title was a definite miss and I got the sinking feeling that I would dislike the game as soon as I started playing it.What is good about this game:* Graphics look great for a Wii game* I used an amazon coupon so I only paid $30 for this titleWhat is bad about this game:* All too easy. If you ever want to know how to ruin a challenging series follow this formula: use generous auto-aiming so you can spam the attack button, use auto-dodging so you don't get hit, use frequent save stations (literally every 3 or 4 rooms) so that you always have full life and ammo, use auto-checkpoints so that in the rare event you actually die you don't even have to go back to the last save station, use a stupid concentration system that allows you to infinitely regain health and ammo so you never die, remove all puzzle elements from the game (instead replaced with find the morphball track in each room), still hide powerups but show them as brightly glowing dots on the map so there's no need to go hunting for them, replace intricate boss battles with simplified pattern matching, shorten the story campaign to roughly 8 hours, the list goes on...* No music. This one hurt, previous titles have had such good foreground music and all we get with Other M is low key ambiance that pipes up during boss battles.* Destruction of Samus' character. Samus, the lone bounty hunter that saved the galaxy from peril, defeating waves of lethal aliens, all on her own apparently has daddy issues, and struggles being a woman in a man's military world. Wow, how long did it take you to come up with that one? No complexity, no ferocity and ambition. Just a chick dealing with sexism in the world and struggling to not be controlled by her emotions. Sigh. Yes, Samus is human and feels emotions and has issues. It doesn't mean that she should have daddy issues like every other fictional character (we've had enough of this with every character on lost having these issues), and it certainly doesn't mean that Samus should be dominated by her emotions. If you don't believe me, just wait for one of the battles. It made me sad to see what they've reduced Samus's character to.* Long, boring CGI sequences. So many games are going this route and its sad to see the Metroid series fall to this pattern. Instead of developing an interesting and engrossing method of telling a story, we're instead presented with long, beautifully rendered videos revealing the Final Fantas... I mean Metroid story. Samus narrates the entire time. And yes, the voice acting is terrible. Just watch a trailer to find out. Its like that the whole time. They tried to convey detached interest and instead came across like a robot for Samus's voice. After playing this game, I feel like more work was put on developing visually pleasing cut-scenes (that you can't skip/pause) than on the actual gameplay. And for a series like Metroid, that is most disappointing.I won't talk about how unbelievably science fiction cliche the story ended up being because I don't want to risk spoilers, but I will say I hard a hard time tolerating the story. If you combine that with all the game play elements that seemed to dumb down this game and that the series trademarks (such as exploration, music, puzzle solving) are completely missing from this game, I don't understand why this is even a Metroid game.Listen to the negative reviews, particularly if you are a fan of the series, because they are all accurate.

    Nintendo",1,"I hate Other M with a white hot blistering passion. That game is a horrid and mutilated abortion that should've been shot before it permanently damaged this beloved franchise. Not only is the story horrible due to Samus' inexcusable characterization (she wasn't human, she was a submissive emo weakling!!) but the gameplay is one of the most flawed experiences that any developer has ever dished out. The reason some people like the game is because they miraculously ignore all of the following factors. Platforming with a d pad in 3D space is way' too frustrating sometimes, auto aiming and sense move take away the' challenge of the game, enemies no longer drop pick ups so killing non bosses is absolutely pointless, all you do is concentrate yourself back to partial health and full missiles, in' first person view, you can only turn by holding the b button, but that's also the lock on mechanism so if something is in the way of your initial target you're screwed, those behind the shoulder view segments pointlessly slow Down the pacing of the game, the parts when you are forced' to find a clue in first person are the most retarded concepts I've ever heard of. It takes twenty minutes to find the badge'' on the zebesian pirate and the green blood on the green grass behind you (>_&lt;) exploration feels incredibly dumbed down compared to past titles, the game feels way too linear to be a metroid game, the art style, soundtrack, and atmosphere are nowhere near as engaging as they were in past titles, and last but certainly not least, they turned Samus Aran, one of the most beloved icons in gaming history, into a space-faring Bella Swan who was so submissive to Adam that she didn't turn on her varia suit even though she was dying of heat and it was already at her disposal like almost all of her equipment because she ""respects"" him so much.....I also' hate the fact that she calls herself a Fledgeling girl' and she uses such tween terms like Confession Time. I hate that she is so maternally obsessed with a creature that she clearly didn't care much for initially, I mean she gave the metroid away to' science! She doesn't even make 1 mention of the Chozo, the race who raised and cared for her, or her parents who died protecting her, yet shes constantly mentioning ""the baby"" and her daddy issues with Adam Malkovich, who also turned out to be a disappointingly stupid character...What the hell?!!  I could understand if she was touched by its sacrifice, but the way Samus keeps going on and on about it is enough to give you bloody ears. I find all of this to be sickeningly sexist. They turned Samus into one of the most idiotic characters I've ever come across and that's absolutely unforgivable. I mean it's not like I wanted Samus to be unemotional or anything. I wouldn't mind at all to have seen her cry, but this game just made me want for her to shut up and stop stating such horrid dialogue filled with obvious explanations of things that didn't need explanation for the sake of storytelling....Samus Aran used to be the Ellen Ripley of gaming. A tragic, but strong independent and humble heroine (go read the dialogue in previous games and the manga as well, you'll see that this was her established personality). Not to mention that she's also one of the least sexualized female characters in video games. Now she's a space faring Bella Swan, and I'm honestly as disappointed as Star Wars fans were with George Lucas after Phantom Menace came out (personally I love all of the star wars films). If the next game doesn't remove Other M from the series chronology then Yoshio Sakamoto team ninja and Nintendo have successfully ruined a flagship powerhouse under the Nintendo banner....It truly is a sad time for fans of the series like myself. This used to be my favorite franchise, but now I dont find Samus engaging at all and that takes away some of the enjoyment out of games such as Metroid Prime and Super Metroid, which in my opinion are some of the best games ever made and the fact that Pther M could ruin them in such a manner is truly tragic...seriously people, anyone who didn't like Other M should call Nintendo and give them their feedback and just maybe this will be solved, but I doubt it... For now, RIP metroid...looks like I WON'T be seeing you next mission..........;(",The worst gaming experience I have ever encountered...

    Nintendo",1,"I hit a game breaking bug in this, so was never able to finish it and have to recommend against buying it.  It's a known bug that several FAQs mention.  Hard to describe where it is, but it's in Sector 3, the SECOND time you go to sector 3, shortly after getting the grapple beam.  There's a door that will not open (that's supposed to) if hours earlier you backtracked at some point apparently after getting the ice beam.  According to the FAQs, there's no work around...save for starting the game over, which I'm not going to do (I've already spent a couple of weeks on it so far, and I'm not even clear how to avoid the bug).Until I hit that point I had mixed feelings about the game.  I really like the story, and the exploration is a lot of fun.  The controls mostly work great, except for having to use the IR camera to switch to first person mode, leaving you vulnerable.  That sometimes works okay during boss fights, and sometimes is a pain, but the game would play better if you just toggled missiles on and shot them with the normal controls.Besides that, I don't like the constant boss battles.  It feels like there's one every 5 minutes...I'm not sure if that's an exaggeration or not, but there really are a constant stream of boss battles, and for me they're the weak point of the game.  Thinking back, the original Metroid had literally only three boss fights, and this has near constant ones, most of which I didn't much like (aside from a few that are actually story related).So...if not for that game breaking bug, I'd maybe have ended up giving this a mixed review, and a mild recommendation.  I still want a Metroid 5, and don't know if we'll ever get it...but this was better than I expected.  With the bug?

Normally the game has one character you control on screen with the nunchuk while shooting with the Wii Remote pointing at the screen. But two player mode doesn't add a second character--it just lets another person shoot at the screen! There's no dodging or special attacks, just holding the trigger and making it harder to see what's going on.Something positive is the addition of subtitles in multiple languages (including Japanese) but the dialogue is so hard to make out and silly that it doesn't really matter.

They're not that big a deal on lower difficulties, but on higher difficulties, you have to wrestle the camera to see enemies who attack off screen and this becomes in issue in more then a few boss fights. Also, dodging is way too difficult to use. Many times, I've tried to execute a dodge, because some enemy attacks require you to do this with good timing, and I end up running into their attacks rather then dodging-and on higher difficulties, dodging becomes essential to survival. With the camera issues and the impossible dodge mechanics, you cannot ever clear this game 100%-ever. Doing so is literally impossible!

They ruined the last 2 Zelda games with forced crap motion controls and now they release this game which would be great if you could use the cpp to aim instead of the stylus.

    Nintendo",1,"This game has good graphics and it looks like a lot of fun. However, the control scheme is a piece of ****! I heard the controls may be a bit frustrating and aggravating at times, so I thought ""How bad could it be?"" But wow ...! The circle pad pro is compatible, but the developers didn't implement it for optimal usage. Why can't we use one circle pad to move and the other to control aiming? Aiming with the stylus alone is just horrendous, which in turn, kills all the fun and gameplay. If there is a major update, fixing the controls with the circle pad pro, then I would totally give this 5 stars. But until then, due to the poor controls, which messes up all the fun and gameplay, I cannot give this higher than a 1 star. I absolutely DO NOT RECOMMEND this game to anyone (unless if there is a major update fixing the controls)!!!! It's just not worth the $40! Dumb control scheme=game fail. And they had this brilliant idea of wasting millions of dollars inventing this piece of **** plastic stand when they could have invested all that money into a little more time in developing an additional option with the circle pad pro.

    Nintendo",1,"This game has great graphics and is one of the better looking games I've seen on the 3DS. Unfortunately, the control setup ruins the experience. Being left handed, I had to switch the control scheme so that I control the main character's movement with the buttons on the right. This is a counter-intuitive setup. I find myself many times trying to shoot by pressing one of these buttons rather than the shoulder button. It's more difficult using the buttons rather than the joystick for directional movement.  And if that doesn't present enough of a challenge, you then have to aim using the stylus. It all becomes something of a chore. I really don't have a desire to play this game again, so I'll be trading it soon. For left handers, I'd recommend staying away from this game. For right-handers, perhaps it will be a different experience. But aiming with the stylus and moving the main character with the joystick is akin to patting your head and rubbing your stomach at the same time. When the acton heats up, it's become frustrating.",Looks great but controls ruin the game

    Nintendo",2,"I bought Flingsmash based on Nintendo's usually reliable track record of providing fun games with their first party controllers and periphials (Wii Sports Resort, Mario Kart Wii), with my decision also influenced by a July E3 preview on IGN.com where this game was called ""Span Smasher"" and sounded like the sleeper hit of the year. The fact that it came with the new Remote Plus made it also appear to be a great value.That being said...if you gamble, sooner or later, you'll lose. Nintendo took a gamble that Artoon (developer of Yoshi's Island DS) could make a game to showcase the Remote Plus' abilities. I took a gamble that the game would be the hit that IGN said it would be. We both lost. Flingsmash simply does not work as intended, and could very well be the most disappointing purchase I've made for the Wii yet. The fact that Nintendo packaged this turd with it's Remote Plus makes me disappointed with them for not pushing themselves and Artoon harder to create a better gaming experience.The premise is simple: you use the Remote Plus to smack the ""hero"" into boulders, prizes and enemies across a pre-determined course, trying to keep the character moving, as a 3 headed ""Hydracoil"" (dragon) is behind you. Collect 3 special coins scattered about the board, which transform into a pearl when you reach the end. Collect enough pearls and you face the ""Boss"" at the end of each stage and advance. As you progress, new action items appear such as cannons, spinners, tunnels...etc, and while it all sounds like a great amount of fun, it should be noted that the character seldom goes exactly where you want to smack him. This is not because I am ""holding the controller wrong"", or based on skill. I've played my fair share of Wii Sports tennis and other games where you hit objects and they go where intended.As if graphics matter at this point, they are OK, showing a style reminiscent from Artoon's Yoshi's Island DS. The music and sound effects are by and large forgettable. The storyline is just there to give the character/game a purpose. Nintendo has made plenty of games with outside developers since the NES days, with silly storylines but solid gameplay. A good example was RARE's ""Cobra Triangle"". The most bizarre storyline ever, but a fun game. The only difference between ""Cobra Triangle"" and Flingsmash is that ""Cobra Triangle"" was fun.If you need a new Remote Plus, this game is basically free. Without the Remote Plus, this game would most likely find good company in the discount bin.Oh, and by the way, IGN changed their tune and ended up giving this game a poor rating as well. What happened since July?",Well....

    Nintendo",2,"I hate to be the contrarian here for a game which lots of people seem to really like, but I just didn't.  I have played the other two Layton games which were, like this one, also kind of plodding, but were also quite a bit more challenging.This game does have an interesting story of going forward in time to find the prime minister who appears to have been kidnapped into the future. Kinda interesing set-up and could have had a lot of potential.  However, the delivery is just so rambling and boring.  To progress the story, you have to click on the various people throughout the world.  They either give you a puzzle (which are generally the most fun part of the game) or they start in on a long click-through dialouge, most of which are not really relevant to the story (e.g. ""Don't you just love toasted buns, I love them but my husband doesn't...."").  This draws the game out and wastes a lot of time without really adding anything.The puzzles are surprisingly easy and much easier than the previous two games.  I am not sure if this is an attempt to reach out to a younger audience or just evidences after three games, they have used up the best ideas.  In any case, I really didn't have a whole lot of fun with the puzzles which can generally be solved in less than a minute and aren't really all that clever (with a couple of notable exceptions).So, is it worth your hard earned $30?

    Nintendo",1,"This game seemed interesting to me at first. I have never been a big donkey kong fan, but i do like adventure games. The overhead world looks nice, and the graphics are pretty decent, But what good is a game that starts off way too difficult on the first level? The time trial is way too difficult, but like most games the requirement for getting the gold medal for a time trial or other challenge is not too demanding. Another complaint i have is the controls. The wii remote is good for alot of things, but not for this game. To execute this  DK rolling move, you shake the remote. Now why do we not have the option to use a gamecube controller like we did in mario kart wii and SSBB, it is not like the wii was incapable of using the gamecube controller port for wii games.  That DK roll comes in handy with the time trials, but it is almost impossible to get the gold medal in the 1st level because it is a distraction to have to shake the remote while using the D-pad to move and a button to jump. An ideal way to play was to have the option to use a gamecube controller and have the DK roll assigned to the X button, but for some reason you cant use a gamecube controller. I know this is the wii and people want to utilize the wii's motion controls, but in this situation, it would have been best to use a gamecube controller. Games like mario party 8 and zelda twilight princess actually fully utilize the wiimote's motion controls.In conclusion, this game does have nice graphics and presentation, but what kills it is the punishing difficulty and bad controls.","Way too difficult in the beginning of the game, bad controls."

This is the type of game I grew up with on NES and Super NES that kids these days would commit suicide trying to complete the first level.  It's needlessly difficult with endless pits, barrel shots and mine cart levels.  These levels are not fun, cause nothing but frustration and add nothing to the game when they are repeated and over stay their initial unwelcome.  The problem is 90% of the game are these type of stupid levels.  This game is nothing special and needlessly difficult for no good reason other than pit levels, poor controls like Mario wii and poor hit detection.  One thing I will give them credit for is improving the crippled multiplayer style seen on Mario wii.  Too bad they didn't have many worth while maps for it to be utilized in since once again they are mostly pits, and mine cart nightmares. This game pretty much sucks as hard as Mario wii but with better multiplayer....but that's not saying much since Mario wii champions the worst trip over the other players feet multiplayer in history.",Needlessly difficult with endless pit levels and poor controls

    Nintendo",2,"I only paid $17 for this, since I used credit from a few trade-ins... and now I'm really glad I didn't pay the full $45-50. I loved the old DKC games on SNES, and seeing how highly reviewed this game is, I assumed it would be a good buy. But I'm disappointed. Here are my impressions after playing a few levels...The graphics and music are good, very reminiscent of the original game, and for the most part the controls are good. But there are a couple things that are dealbreakers for me:-In solo mode, you can only control DK (if you get Diddy, he just rides on your back and provides a little extra jumping/hovering ability... boring). I find this really annoying... in all the previous DKC games I would ALWAYS opt for Diddy (or Dixie over Kiddie) because I prefer the light, fast Kongs to the lunky ones. The fact that I'd have to play the entire game as lunky DK is not so appealing. :(-I don't like the forced motion controls--it seems to interrupt game play in this platformer more than the motion controls in, say, Super Mario Galaxy. It just feels awkward to use, especially with the barrel roll.Those two things give the controls a ""sluggish"" feel to me, and make it feel a bit like work to get through a level--doesn't really make me want to play it for hours on end like the old games. I'll probably play a little more just to get to a Minecart level, and then sell it back (I think Gamestop is giving $20 for it). It's too bad, I really wanted to like this game. I really should have read more reviews--I probably wouldn't have bought it in the first place if I did!  Lesson learned.People that never played the original DKC games will probably like it better; without comparing it to anything else, it seems like an okay game, if a little tricky for those unused to 2D platforming.",only DK in solo mode? ugh.

    Nintendo",2,"...then you'll get 'em in spades in Donkey Kong Country Returns. I bought the game because I am a huge fan of the Nintendo characters they've brought to life on Wii. I count Super Mario Galaxy 1 & 2 as among my favorite games--and games that were fun enough (and didn't require expert technique) that I could enjoy with my wife, a non-gamer. And she loved them. So I bought DKCR with the same mindset, that'd it'd be fun for the two of us to tag-team together. Only I figured that, hey, I'd test-drive the game myself first.And so began a frustrating experience with this game, with just a non-stop series of unavoidable deaths. I remember finishing the first world and thinking: ""okay... that was decently enjoyable."" The next world brought more jumping on/off platforms into the unknown (wasn't it great in the old games when you could hold DK down and see what was around you on the screen?) and into cheap deaths. After world #2 I thought: ""well, okay... that was their cheap-death world... there's usually one in every game like this."" Except that each subsequent world was even more filled with these kinds of deaths. That's why you're given the option (though it quickly becomes a necessity) to buy lives from Grandpa Kong. Can you imagine Mario doing that? Making you buy lives instead of earning them? And yet that's what they have. Plus the same repetitive mini-games over and over again. Ugh.The day I started the Cave section, I must've died 100 times in a 2-hour span and it's all the same nonsense: you go about 1.5 screens ahead each time and run into a cheap, unavoidable death (unless you've seen it before and remembered it) and then it is back to the beginning, try it again. It's a deathly slowwwwwww progression through some of these levels--especially the ones where DK flies a rocket barrel. And finally, although I'm close to the end (am on the 2nd stage of the Volcano world), I had to finally lay my Wii controller down and vent at this game (via an Amazon review) for being lazy enough to create a platformer full of cheap deaths and slap the DK name on it.Needless to say, my wife never would have made it through world 1. She actually asked me why I hadn't let her try it and I rolled my eyes and she got it. I'm really disappointed because this was the one game I was really looking forward to occupying my time (in a fun way, not a frustrating way) over the Christmas break.",If You Like Cheap Deaths...

    Nintendo",2,"This is the spiritual successor to the award winning Power Glove for NES. You will love to play this for like 2 days and the stick it in a closet for all eternity. If you are a ""real"" gamer from the 80s or 90s then you can only fool yourself into liking this thing for so long. At least when you got tired of the power glove you got to keep it around as an awesome fashion accessory. I wish I still had mine so I could wear it out to the mall and turn all sorts of heads. So in some ways the power glove was better. Having the power glove entitled you to replace any reference to your hands with the words ""power gloves"".  For example:  ""I can't wait to get my power gloves onto that(fill in blank)"". Also the power glove was a good way to intimidate people. If I went to a bar with a huge bouncer I'd really behave myself, but if I went to a bar with a average sized bouncer wearing a power glove it would have the same effect. This can be seen in the equation below:When P = power glove and I = intimidation and C = coolnessP = (10000000 * I) + (infinity * C)^2Now If I was in said bar and the bouncer had a wiimote instead of a power glove I would trash the place out of principle.It's not all bad, Wii has like 5 good games so if you really want to play one of those 5 good games I guess you should buy the wii. i would also add that the wii is good if you are a little kid, a person that hates normal video games due to lack of hand eye coordination or a small animal. If you are a large animal like Bigfoot you will not enjoy wii very much unless you smash it to demonstrate your dominance to your pack. Needless to say a Bigfoot wearing a power glove would have already demonstrated his superiority by just putting it on and would not require additional smashing.Personally I am probably not the audience for this magical device, but have watched literally thousands of people bail on this product due to lack of quality software. It has basically become a marketing machine for other things like reality tv shows. I am sure Jersey Shore for wii is in the works.

I dreamed of testing  code after code for my action replay card, and checking off  awesome creature after awesome creature. This game had it all when it came to awesomness: Updated bag,graphics that look slicker and cooler, awesome sounds and they even added a friendship element to the story to make it  extremely enjoyable. They only forgot one  detail....THE POKEMON!!!The Pokemon of the Unova region look like they were  designed  by an anhedonic  35 year old man who does nothing but sit in a cubicle all day. No creativity whatsoever!! NOT A SHRED!!!. Need examples? Alright then. There's &#34;Lilipup&#34; The Puppy Pokemon. Design? A Scottish Terrier.  That's it. A plain old Scottish Terrier.  Evolutions? Herderier. A scottish terrier with long black hair on its back and Stoutland: A Scottish terrier with a  gigantic mustache.Still not convinced?There's ducklett. Design? A duck. Not an interesting ;looking duck like Psyduck. It's quite literally a duck. The kind you see in ponds at the park. A DUCK.Cofagricus? A sarcophagus.Krookodile? Do I need to say it?Here's a fun one!Rogenrola. IT'S A ROCK!!!.Munna? I wish it looked like a moon but if you want me to be brutally honest? It looks like an infected kidney with pink blood  coming out of it.Aside from the starters it isn't worth trying to  catch any new pokemon. at all!!! I can't believe it but heartgold is way superior to this. All the new Pokemon are good for is making you want to get on your knees and thank God above when the main story (I'll get to that next.) is over  and you begin catching the old Pokemon.As previously stated, the friendship element added to the story  is really enjoyable. You'll find yourself battling your friends and interacting with them to some extent. Aside from that, the plot of this game is confusing. It's stated early on that Team Plasma believes that fighting Pokemon  is wrong and oppresses them. It is also clear that they want to liberate Pokemon by stealing them from trainers but the main antagonists were so bland and undeveloped that just how they were planning to do this got lost. I wasn't invested at all. By the time I reached the fourth town my only concern was getting  to the end of the awful game so I could use the transfer lab.Tips:If you can't get your DSI action replay card to work on this game (Mine is very old and came with a disk) and you can't update the firmware:1. click  on the top of DSI code manager(Make sure your AR is connected to the computer with  the usb)2. reset your  Action replay card. This will delete all of the codes on it but do not despair.3. Simply drag and drop the titles you want the codes for from the subscription menu and click save changes afterwards.This should resolve the problem. It worked for me.VERY IMPORTANTOnce you have your action replay working on this game be warned that if you use the &#34;Catch other trainer's Pokemon&#34; option  YOU WILL AUTOMATICALLY LOSE THE BATTLE. In Heartgold you automatically won but that's not the case here.I  found an excellent Amazon seller who only charged me twelve bucks for this  utter disgrace, case and all.

    Nintendo",2,"I got my first Pokemon game back in 1998, right when the fad kicked off. I had Pokemon everything -- clothes, plushies, and even cereal. The original Red/Blue were amazing games that gamers in that era had never experienced before. The fact that you could link up with friends to trade/battle was revolutionary back in the '90s. That being said, Nintendo obviously pushed the Pokemon name, producing more and more games just because they knew it would sell well. So how do 2011's Black/White fare up to the previous generations?In two words: they don't. Period. The number one reason why I can't play these games much are the Pokemon designs. For some reason, the art design team at GameFreak rotates members with each new generation. While this can result in some fresh, original designs at times, the truth is that we need Sugimori and his original guys. The Pokemon in Black/White are the worst I've seen. I can understand a pile of sludge (Grimer/Muk from Red/Blue), but an ice cream cone? A literal pile of garbage? Also, the Pokemon this generation are extremely overpowered. To balance this, they have given some new abilities to previous generation Pokemon through the Dream World, but the chances of you getting a Solar Power Charizard or a similar Pokemon there are slim to none.They also removed some of the basic battle functions online. You will find yourself quite limited now, considering the new level and Pokemon restrictions.Now, there are some aspects of Black/White that I like -- the music is pretty outstanding, they story is above average, etc. But there are so many features that should be there that just are not, like full character customization, GBA backwards compatibility, and more.

You're constantly blocked from going past any area because the game forces you into doing this or that first, and it's not just about beating a certain gym first, now it's for everything. Here is basically the first hour of my game...- Game has intro, then STOPPED so your mom can get a call.- Go downstairs, STOPPED by mom to tell me the same thing I just heard from the call...why do they need to tell me this twice?- Go outside, STOPPED by rival for no real reason.- After you get your starter, you are STOPPED by rival to get his Pokedex (Why does it stop me for this?)- Move a few steps, STOPPED by rival so he can battle you.- When done, you are DRAGGED to the Pokemon Center by Bianca, who forces you into a tour of the place with no way to cancel out of it.- When that's done, you are STOPPED AGAIN by Bianca and Co, who gives you your Running Shoes. Everywhere else is locked, so you have no choice but to follow Bianca.- Get to the gate before the first path, STOPPED by the attendant there.- Finally get outside the path, STOPPED again by Bianca so she can show you how to catch a Pokemon.- Before you can get to the next town, STOPPED by Alder so he can yap about something, once again forced to follow him.- Get into town, STOPPED by Alder again so he can tell you to heal your Pokemon.- Go to Alder's house, STOPPED by Alder so he can tell you to give a Town Map to your rival first.(Why it doesn't just drag you to his house instead I'll never know, since your rival and any number of NPCs heal your Pokemon anyways, why not give Alder this function as well?)Already stopped 14 times with no way to skip through any of it before I can even do anything, and even after this you have to follow the straight path because the game conveniently blocks you from going anywhere or doing anything else. Absolutely unnecessary and terrible, where is the skip option?Moving on, this game is also unnecessarily annoying and difficult. Almost all the paths have the same exact Pokemon as the path before it with very little differences. The Pokemon they chose for this are awful with maybe just 1-2 different options unless you really want to run through the game with terrible Pokemon like Watchog and Pidove. I'm not asking for a Dragon-type off the bat but seriously, some more variety here would have done wonders. With over 600+ Pokemon, you can't tell me 1 or 2 stronger ones couldn't have made it into the first few paths, at least to add some variety to the palette.All the Pokemon you fight seeming either have Protect or some equivalent (like Detect) so they can waste your PP, just to end up dying to the same move the next turn in order to really wear you down through attrition. Everything hurts a lot with the massive level jumps, which causes you to either buy a ton of meds and/or run back to the Pokemon Center REALLY often. In just about any other NON-Black & White game, you don't need a single med to really get through the game...they were always more of a luxury than a need, but it's helpful to have...in this game, it's pretty much necessary.With few useful Pokemon to choose from, you'll struggle through the game especially early on when it jumps in levels and forces you to grind in order to stand a chance at the gym. All this was the same exact issue that the original Black & White had, so it's ""nice"" to see how Unova still sticks to its rotten roots here.The game also has an unending array of useless features. The C-Gear thing that dominates your touch screen is totally useless, and I would rather have my regular menu there all the time. The Xtransciever phone system is so terrible...yet ANOTHER way for them to stop you incessantly and without shame, and many of the phone calls serve zero purpose...they neither advance the plot nor do they tell you something remotely useful. They call just to say ""hi"" but you can't hang up on them and you can't not pick up.I can appreciate a harder game, but this game does it for all the wrong reasons. It tries to give you an updated story at the cost of not really letting you play the game, or taking away all your freedom within it. It tries to up the difficulty (I'm guessing that was a design intent) with the level jumps but it doesn't give you many options to deal with it except to struggle through it, with its lack of options at Pokemon to use and annoying moves that wear you out so fast through attrition.EDITEDHaving finished the game now, it does get a bit easier down the road, but not by much. The story is not much more improved than the original Black & White and it doesn't add much to it overall. Basically Team Plasma's old boss is still around and even though he was beaten in Black/White already, his minions still refuse to give up and keep trying to push their evil ways in Unova. It's not even really original and I got bored of it really fast. The only twist it provided is now they can fuse the Legendaries together and force you to fight this ""super"" version of it. Mine went down in 1 hit, which really took away from how ""super"" it was supposed to be. How's it supposed to take over Unova and bring a new ice age when I, a seemingly random trainer, can beat it in one single hit?The Elite Four in this game was for me, easier than a lot of the Gym Leaders were at the time...but what is more disappointing is that Iris, the new Champion, was a bigger pushover than any of them. I felt no sense of accomplishment beating her because I didn't lose a single Pokemon and only took damage once the entire time. I've lost over half my team to the Gym Leaders before this fight....yet the Champion couldn't touch me?This game does have an extensive end-game, but also makes you wish they had some of this stuff in the normal playthrough. The only Pokemon game I can remember that doesn't give you a Super Rod (or ANY rod for that matter, since the Good/Old Rods are removed in this game) until past the end of the game...and not just immediately past, but way past. This combined with what I mentioned before really limit the kinds of Pokemon you can catch and what you have access to for the majority of the game.During the normal playthrough you'll notice areas you didn't have access to...now you do. This includes the original starting area in Black/White and some other zones..a lot of these towns and paths are abbreviated...really short paths with a few trainers and a couple items, and not much else. Mostly you're going to have to revisit a lot of older places to find the Legendaries there now that you've beaten the Elite Four. Besides this there are a few more story points here and there and you can battle some boss NPCs again and that's about it. I would have liked to have (and this would have been infinitely more useful) these extra trainers during the normal playthrough in anticipation of beating the Elite Four...not AFTER I beat them which really kind of renders the whole thing useless.The last thing that really gets me is that the Forces of Nature are just outright missing from this game. In the original Black/White you can capture either Thundurus or Tornadus depending on your version, and when you did it and got both in a single game you could get Landorus too. Here, NONE of them are available...and considering they are Generation V Legendaries, where are they? Oh that's right...you have to buy a silly little minigame on the 3DS called Dream Radar to get access to them....wow. It's one thing to try and sell these little games on the 3DS store but it's another to literally rip out 3 of the Legendaries in the game just to sell it...it doesn't even really make sense because Black/White 2 is a DS game...NOT a 3DS game but you need a 3DS to get Dream Radar. So you not only needed to buy Dream Radar and play it just to get these guys but you needed a 3DS on top of this? Pretty pathetic way to sell not just the game but a whole system as well...I've never seen Pokemon sink as low as this before......though I guess I shouldn't have been too shocked since this is one of the only generations where the remake came in two versions, and in each version you could only get one of Reshiram or Zekrom, and not both. In Platinum, you could get both Dialga and Palkia. Even in HG/SS you could get both Ho-Oh and Lugia. In Emerald, you could get both Kyogre and Groudon. Here? Only one or the other.My initial review still stands...this is still the worst Pokemon game of its generation. D/P/P and HG/SS puts the whole B/W series to shame, and it's not really close. This game (White 2 for me) feels like it was pushed out way too soon and was just done to cash in on all the Poke-fanboys out there. It looks and feels hastily put together, and most, if not all of the flaws I mentioned above are not present in just about any other Pokemon game. I'm glad X/Y is out now to really finally bury this chapter of Pokemon...X/Y is yet another example of games that do not have most, or any of these flaws and is just a good, well-put together and fun to play game.Feel free to vote me down if you think this is a great game for whatever reason. For all these reasons (and probably more), I mostly hated it and was truthful about it.",Worst Pokemon Game of it's generation.

With Y, I was hoping that would all change. I wanted to get an Iv/Ev trained team with good Pokemon and learn the strategies, because why not?But that's currently out of reach. You can't transfer Pokemon from older games. You have to wait for the $5 a year Pokemon bank coming out December 27th, 2013 in US, assuming it isn't delayed. Sure, you get a month free, but that's only good for people who bought it beforehand. Maybe this wouldn't be so bad if I didn't have to wait two months to use it?Does this detract from the game itself? No, the game is pretty good with excellent graphics, good music and fun gameplay, and of course creative Pokemon. Does it detract from my enjoyment? Yes, it does. I don't want to recatch a ton of Pokemon I planned on training, and I don't want to have to miss out on the extras in Y just because I'm stuck with Black 2. For now, this goes back on my shelf, and I probably won't be picking it up again (I did beat the game).If you've never played Pokemon before, or you don't care about transferring Pokemon from older games, then this is a 5 star game. I admit, I should have been more informed but despite following many news sites, I apparently didn't pay attention enough to know this major drawback. If I had known, I wouldn't have bought the game, and I wouldn't be making this review.

    Nintendo",2,"If you've played the last 5 generations of Pokemon - including the multiple iterations and remakes - then you should know by now that there really isn't much to go over here. The graphics are nicer and they've added new Pokemon, but not much has changed beyond that. Despite being on the 3DS, we're still not working with a fully 3D environment yet. Instead, they just take the 2D over-world and tilt the camera angle a bit to make it appear less flat. They've added some new pointless and unexciting mechanics like riding Pokemon and Horde Battles (battling 5 Pokemon at once). Nothing revolutionary, of course. Some of it is even just flat out unenjoyable like Super Training, a way to boost your Pokemon's stats by hitting a button over and over again.Since Black and White actually introduced characters and a plot ever so slightly different from the mainstay, I was hoping this game would actually give us some kind of story. Nope. You're still a 10 year old kid who sets out with annoying friends to collect gym badges. This time the evil team's name is Team Flare, and their villain is a huge step back from N and Ghetsis as far as character development goes.The Gym Leaders, Elite Four, and Champion are all ridiculously easy. Pokemon has never been known to be a challenging series but you can just steamroll through everyone in this game.There aren't any memorable locations that come to mind. A lot of rehashes actually, i.e. Virdian Forest 2.0; Team Flare's underground base with teleporters and tiles that whirl you across the floor in one direction; a frozen cave which consists of puzzles based on sliding across ice floors (sound familiar?). As I write this all out it makes me realize just how sadly lazy Gamefreak is....Two stars might be generous given all my bashing, but the 3D models of each of the Pokemon look gorgeous. The only actual portion of the game to take advantage of the 3D aspect of the 3DS is within a Pokemon battle, but the Pokemon do look damn good nonetheless.They've also made some slight, slight changes to improve the competitive aspect of the game, such as preventing weather from being permanent and introducing Fairy type to combat Dragons. It's still terribly balanced, though, and you won't care if you're just going to play the main game and not competitively.If this is your first Pokemon game, by all means play it and have a blast. If you've been playing Pokemon since Red/Blue/Yellow, then you won't really see anything you haven't seen (five times) before.",Same game as always

    Nintendo",2,"I have two words for video game designers:  ""Easy Mode"".  Dark Moon is a perfect example of why I think most video games should be made to be playable by casual games as well as hard core gamers.This game makes you play entire missions - which can easily run a half hour in length - without any opportunity to save.  If you die during the mission (and haven't found a ""gold bone"" that gives you one chance at revival), you have to play the whole thing again.  So I'm finding that I play the whole way through a mission, encounter a new type of ghost that I don't yet know how to beat, and it's back to square one.  This is not fun for someone who doesn't have endless amounts of time to kill or isn't an expert gamer.  I officially gave up on the game today, after realizing how much time I would spend repeating missions if I were to play the rest of the game.Great graphics, interesting gameplay, but just too frustrating for me.

So you end up returning to the same mansion, (for example) 4 or more times picking up things that the professor wants you to get or activate a switch or whatever else then return back to him to have another mission unlocked in the same mansion. As you complete the missions,  the mansions boss is unlocked then after you beat the boss a different mansion is unlocked and you pretty much keep doing the same thing over and over until you beat the game.

    Nintendo",2,"Considering the success of the Paper Mario franchise, from Nitendo 64 to GameCube, much was expected from Paper Mario Sticker Star. Unlike the Wii's Super Paper Mario, which was more platformer-based than role-playing, Sticker Star reverts back to the classic formula the series is known for. However, with the introduction of stickers, the idea of having role-playing elements becomes completely shatteted.  Stickers are the basis of all attacks in Sticker Star; jumping on Goombad, shooting fire at Koopas, and hammering away at other enemies. There are weak stickers, and there are powerful stickers, but when it all boils down a a 300-hp boss fight in the desert, which stickers are you more likely to collect? Because of this simple sticker system, the game felt like it required little to no strategy while I was playing through, which is completely opposite of PM64 & PMTYD. Remember Huff n' Puff? You had to be careful when making him multiply and causing more trouble, but you also want to deal the most damage whilst taking the least damage. In PMSS, the sticker system feels constricting and ruins the strategy you might desire. The game is also fairly easy until the final boss, and the in-game hint system will become very useless at times. For instance, when I was in a jungle section, I had no idea I had to hit an invisible block to proceed without taking damage; it be and a bunch of guess and check. Although all Paper Mario games are linear in a way, this game felt too linear, and I felt like I was playing New Super Mario Bros, but this was far less of a problem than the aforementioned. The bosses aren't very inspiring because we've seen them before, Goombas, Bloopers, Pookies, Kamek, Bowser...speaking of Bowser, the same generic Mario story is used; Princess gets captured, Mario saves the day. What's new? It was okay for PM64 because the formula was still evolving, but there should have been more in PMSS. The story - if any - was boring and dull, and I didn't feel sad (if I was supposed to) during certain parts of the game (no spoilers!).Despite the myriad of shortcomings in this game, PMSS should be given credit to its beautiful music, design, art, and sense of humor. I liked playing in 3D throughout the entire game with my volume turned up all the way because it was beautiful . The game also controls very easy, and for those who don't like 3D, ""gimmicks"" aren't forced in this game. The puzzles that you have to use for ""things"" (yes, things) are clever, such as using a bowling ball to knock down pins and reveal a secret exit.All in all, Paper Mario Sticker Star was a disappointment. I regret preordering this game,  but I shouldn't have expected a full console experience on a handheld.",Boring...

    Nintendo",2,"The game only gets a 2/5 star rating from me.The game has 2 fundamental GAME BREAKING flaws.The first flaw is that unlike previous games, They decided to take out the RPG leveling experience. That means no exp, no items to equip and worst of all, NO LEVELING UP.Because of the above flaw, you are stuck with a paper mario that never gets better....enemies such as goombas will always be a pain because unfortunately you cannot improve your stats to make them weaker, most goombas come in packs of 3...each do 2 damage a turn, your chracter only has 20 hp...the problem here is, even if it takes you 1 turn per goomba...well that means each fight will cost you  about 12+ health...so fighting 2 packs of 3 goombas back to back will cause you to die...and because the system doesn't have checkpoints...you will start over...DUMB!!!!The other flaw that pisses me off to no end is the fact that healing items are so rare and hard to come by...you get 10000x crappy stickers(All attacks are stored as 1 time use items called stickers) and the healing stickers are so rare that you will almost never find them...then the shop keepers charge excessively for the individual healing stickers.Basically, the game consists of a cycle where you make progress, with no checkpoints or healing items, get ambushed by a boss die, revert to the last save...(Starting the level over.)This game has a wonderful assortment of colors, and a great concept.This game also has well timed gags and funny storylines...ultimately the above flaws are so bad that I have to mentally prepare myself to play the game knowing full well I will probably get mad and not play it for a week and then repeat the cycle.I had greatly anticipated this game and was shocked to see its price drop to $25, now I know why.","A great concept, great visuals done very wrong."

Also, the final part of the final boss battle is anti-climatic, for if you use boom box and shiny super boot and three flashy hopslippers, you'll chew through the 500 hp of Bowser easily. This game doesn't have a point to battles, other then obtaining coins to buy more stickers. And the only bosses who did anything was Gooper Blooper, Kamek, and Bowser, the rest were just sort of there, unlike in other paper mario games where they did something-and thier design is not very creative, either, I mean, a giant goomba?

    Nintendo",2,"Please put down your pitchforks, my friends, and give me a chance to explain. I am no Nintendo hater. Quite the contrary in fact, and when it comes to the Paper Mario series, I have always been a massive fan, whether it's theoriginal, classic Paper Mario,its utterly amazing sequel, The Thousand-Year Door, or the more platformer-centricSuper Paper Mario, I love me some Paper Mario games. I can't tell you how excited I was when Sticker Star was announced. I bought my 3DS way back when highly anticipating this game, and even though it went through several delays, I waited patiently. All through development, this was promised to be an entry that would take Paper Mario back to its RPG roots, in every sense, and I couldn't have been more psyched. The first two or three hours in, I really enjoyed my time with Sticker Star. It was a blast and the undeniable Paper Mario charm was off the charts. Then, I started to notice some glaring issues, and they became more glaring with each passing moment until I realized something painful, I don't really like this game all that much. Please, put down your torches and pitchforks and let me explain (and I want to be fair to the game and to you, the readers, so this may be a long, detailed review, I'm warning you right now)...First off, there's a reason why I was hooked for the first two or three hours. There are a lot of positives in this game's favor. Here are the biggest ones:- The Presentation. The visuals are spectacular, possibly the best the series has ever had, in fact. The whole ""children's pop-up book"" aesthetic of the Paper Mario series has always been one of its biggest strengths. Not only is it cute, but it somehow pulls off being simultaneously nostalgic and fresh to the extreme, and it's done really well here. Many familiar locales from Mario's history, most notably from thethe New Super Mario Bros series, get their chance to shine, and shine they do. The nostalgia and familiarity is really endearing and some new twists on familiar oldies, like a Mariachi Shy Guy band, or a Yoshi sphinx, are fantastic. There's also something awesome about 2-D, flat paper characters and settings rendered in true 3-D on the 3DS. It's like playing a child's school project diorama come to life. Great job here! And then there's the soundtrack. Oh the soundtrack! The music in this game really blew me away, and on occasion merits putting down the system just to soak it in for a while. Much of it feels like they told a Jazz band to just go nuts with familiar Mario motifs and themes, and it's awesome. Plenty of sax and trumpet to go around. Sweet stuff. Don't even get me started on how sweet the Mariachi Shy Guy band music is.- Stickers, stickers, stickers. Everything revolves around stickers. Yes, everything. The battle system is entirely sticker based, and oftentimes you need certain stickers to solve puzzles in the various levels you visit. Maybe you need to put a mere normal sticker in the environment to open a door. Or maybe you need a special ""thing"" sticker that comes to life and affects the environment in big and surprising ways. There's lots of clever puzzles throughout the whole game. I found the whole ""sticker"" theme to be a refreshing twist on the classical Paper Mario formula, or at least I found the concept to be great anyway.- The Battle System (more on this in the bad section later). In an attempt to return to Paper Mario's RPG roots, Intelligent systems made the battle system a turn-based affair once again. To fight a sense of ""been here, done that,"" they decided to make the battle system revolve around stickers. This means two things. 1.) The entire battle system is, for all intents and purposes, entirely item based (or sticker inventory based, if you will), and 2.) There's a system of strategy that involves proper button inputs to increase the effectiveness of whichever sticker command you choose. This gives the battles a great sense of risk vs. reward as you wonder, ""Can I use this less powerful 'worn-out hammer' perfectly and finish the battle that way? Or should I pull out my more powerful 'flashy hammer' sticker and guarantee a victory?"" This is really cool.This all sounds awesome, doesn't it? Well, yes, that's because it is. It's a unique twist that at least starts to bring the series back to its RPG roots. There are a few HUGE problems, however, that really pull the rest of the game down. I'll try to explain them now:- The story. There is no story, really. Yeah, at the beginning, Bowser grabs a giant, mythical royal sticker he's not supposed to, and because of that sticker's power, he himself becomes a super powerful, shiny sticker. He gives each fragment of the original royal sticker to five of his henchmen across the land, and it's up to Mario to go to each area, traverse their levels, and get each crown sticker back. After this introduction to the story, there's nothing more. No more plot, no more interesting characters, no real developments. It's bizarre, because the game actually feels like a traditional Mario platformer in terms of its story, in that, there is virtually none. Even the way you get from level to level is like a Mario platformer: an overworld map in a ""level 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, etc."" sort of way. Again, it's more akin toNew Super Mario Bros. Each level itself is styled in the way the original Paper Mario was, but there's no big world to explore, no big, interesting towns to visit, no companions to meet and take along with you, nothing. There's only one companion, a floating crown sticker named Kersti who is basically Mario's very ownNavi, but not nearly as charming or likable. Even Super Paper Mario, which was basically a platformer at heart, had way more plot and characters than this. What happened? There's no incentive to keep going, as far as plot is concerned. Again, in a Mario platformer, that's not a problem, but this isn't a platformer! It's *supposed* to be more of an RPG, and in an RPG, plot is kinda important.- The Battle System. Now wait a minute, didn't I say this was a positive? Well, yeah, the battle system itself is fantastic, except for one MASSIVE problem: It's all meaningless! After playing for an hour or two, I noticed something; there's no place in the menu to see Mario's stats, or his level, or his equipment... there's only sticker inventory. Wait, does that mean there's NO experience points (or Star Points, to be accurate) or leveling up in this game? Yep, there are *zero* tangible benefits to battles. The ONLY reward for winning battles are coins and stickers. Stickers are *everywhere* in the world as you explore, so this battle reward is meaningless. Coins are also everywhere in the levels, and their only use is for buying more stickers, so again, meaningless. The battles that are otherwise brilliantly conceived are rendered a waste of your time by no meaningful, tangible rewards for your efforts. There's no sense of progression in Mario's character, whatsoever. It makes more sense to just avoid enemies on the map altogether (who always respawn when you go back to already conquered areas, by the way, and since backtracking is a big part of this game at times, this is troublesome and annoying). Coming from Thousand-Year Door, where I actually sought out battles as much as I could due to their one-two punch of awesome design and satisfaction from winning, this is a *massive* gaffe. I mean, it's unforgivable really. Imagine truly great RPGs, ones likeFinal Fantasy IV(or VI, VII, and IX, take your pick, they're all amazing),Chrono Trigger,Earthbound,Radiant Historia, Super Mario RPG, the Mario and Luigi rpg series, or the first two Paper Mario titles, and imagine them without experience points, new, better equipment to find/aquire, or a leveling system. Blasphemy! If this wasn't trying to be an RPG, it wouldn't be so bad, but everything else in the game hearkens back to the RPG Paper Mario titles. *Sigh*- Perhaps the WORST thing about the game is its lost potential. When Intelligent Systems started work on this game, they wanted to make it a true sequel to 1,000-Year Door. They had a big, epic plot planned out. There was going to be a charming overworld filled with exciting places to explore and characters to meet. There would be several unique, lovable companions to join you on your quest. The theater turn-based battles with audiences would come back. All throughout the process, however, Shigeru Miyamoto rejected all of these ideas until this game became the finished product. I love you Miyamoto-San, but what the H-E-doublehockeysticks were you thinking!? If Intelligent Systems' original vision for this game had been allowed to come to fruition, I have no doubt whatsoever that this would have been a 5-star masterpiece. Look at their track record for a moment: all Paper Mario games up until this one, the Fire Emblem series, the Advance Wars series, the WarioWare series, Pushmo, Crashmo, and the list goes on. These guys are masters of their craft, and this would have been another masterpiece to add to that list, if only Uncle Shiggy hadn't gotten in the way (I love the guy, he's a true inspiration to gamers everywhere, but this is a blemish on his otherwise astronomically great record). What would have been a masterpiece has been turned into a game that is merely ""OK,"" and that is the most painful thing of all about this game: The lost potential.I am not an overly critical person. I think this is my second or third 2-star review in total. I'd much rather review games I love or at least really like, not ones I think are just ""meh"" or ""OK."" I *really* wanted to love this game, but given the massive loss of potential, and the real botching of some of the most crucial aspects of the game that would have justified the change in direction, I just can't. I really tried with this game, but in the end, I just couldn't shake the growing feeling of disappointment and boredom anymore. Super Paper Mario really changed up the traditional formula, sure, but it was still a wonderfully executed game that was great on its own. Sticker Star could have been a nice spin-off Paper Mario title like that one was if there was even a slightly better plot to break the monotony, a battle system that actually feels rewarding, and a sense of satisfaction and progress for Mario's character throughout the game, but it just isn't there. Maybe others will find more enjoyment in this game. The game has some real strength in its presentation and many of the core concepts are sound, but it just isn't for me. I'm sorry Intelligent Systems, I'm sorry fellow Paper Mario fans, and most painfully, I'm sorry Paper Mario, but I just don't like Paper Mario: Sticker Star. Thanks for reading my review and hearing me out. You can go ahead and get out your pitchforks now.",It hurts me to say this...

I've been playing this for over a month and to be honest after the island and barber shop were locked, everything just became so mundane and ultimately boring.  I also have the not-so-uncommon luck of scoring a large percentage of ugly and rude NPC villagers. You can have only up to 10 animal villagers, the last of which can only be invited at the camp site after it's built. My villagers tend to be rude, calling me bad names and often criticizing me for being fat. I wonder if the dialogs were lost in translation. I'm shocked by the insensitivities of some of the things the animals say. They're especially bad for kids; my son refused to play it again after he was told he was annoying by one of the characters. Complaining to Isabelle, the yellow dog who ultimately runs the town, did not help.The game involves catching the same bugs and fish, in the town or on Tortimer's Island, and planting a few flowers and talking to aforementioned rude neighbors. You can visit other towns and use StreetPass to set up the home showcase park, but all these become boring after a few days.I now hope I can sell this game for a good price.","Gets boring after two weeks; ugly, annoying NPCs"

    Nintendo",1,"I bought this game expecting an exciting GTA-like open world game where I'm free to do what I want, but unfortunately the only combat to be found in this game is chopping down trees. I'm serious! There's only one weapon - the axe. And you can't even kill anybody! If you go up to them and try to hit them, it'll just start a conversation with them.You live in a neighborhood full of animals such as dogs, cats, etc, and they all live in their own house. You would expect there to be an option to rob them, or kill them in their sleep or something, right? After all, this is supposed to be a video game where you can do whatever you want. But you can't! If you try to chop their door down with the axe at night, it'll just inform you that they're sleeping.So as I'm starting my game I'm just waiting for a Fallout 3-esque menu to pick what skills I want to level up, and I wanted to play this game being as stealthy as possible. But unfortunately, there's no leveling up system, no weapons, no combat, nothing!

You can pluck weeds. Go fishing. Talk to neighbors (With only ONE THING TO SAY to them, as opposed to having many conversation choices in games like Fallout 3 and Mass Effect) Catch bugs. Sell stuff. Pay off your house. Make your house bigger. Decorate your house. Yes, I'm talking about a VIDEO GAME. Doesn't it sound like things your mom would ask you to do? Aren't those the kind of things you play video games to escape from?The beautiful thing about video games are that they dump you in a world where you can be whatever you want, they make you feel like somebody you could never dream of being. You can fight enemies, kill innocent people, you can be anybody you want to be! But in this game, all you can be is a stupid little kid who does chores.

To all future buyers of this game, if you have the SNES version and are looking for an enhanced graphics and whatnot on the Wii, you will be disappointed.  The reason why I mentioned the virtual console is that I recognized the opponent in the accompaing screen shot when a user is about to use whatever Wii points he or she has.  For those that don't know, the opponent is ""Bear Hugger"".

    Nintendo",2,"I've thoroughly enjoyed and cleared the original Japanese Rhythm Heaven on the Gameboy Advance and the sequel on the DS. This game is the 3rd in the series, but is the weakest of them all. While art style is sharp and funny and the songs are catchy, the gameplay is difficult, unforgiving, and is mired with poor design choices.I was most excited about having a multiplayer Rhythm Heaven game, especially since it's the Wii. The box boasts ""50+ games"" and ""Two-player mode"" but there are only a couple multiplayer games (vs. 50 single player games), and you need to unlock them as you go along. So you can't just turn on the game with a friend to play, you have to basically clear the single player mode first. The ones I've unlocked so far are just two player versions of the other games too, which was a letdown.The single player campaign is hard. All of the Rhythm Heaven games have been difficult, but I had a lot more trouble with this one. I think a lot of it has to do with the way you have to hit the A and B buttons to control the game--the buttons don't seem to react at quite the right speed, especially if you have to tap A several times in a row. I've never had this problem with other Wii rhythm games or Rhythm Heaven games.The interface is clunky, too. They still haven't fixed that there isn't a ""Restart"" or ""Retry"" option when you pause the game or fail a level. You have click back through the main menus, and it gets time consuming. It's also frustrating that there's no way to gauge how well you're doing at a level, or when you've failed. Sometimes the game gives you feedback based on how you did (saying your timing was good kicking the soccer ball, but not football, for one game), but there's nothing like that for the hardest Remix levels--it just says ""That could have been better"" when you fail it.I really wanted to like this game, but it seems like they kept the most frustrating and user-unfriendly parts from the older titles. Even at the budget release of $30, I can't suggest this one. Get the DS version or GBA if you can find those instead.","Great idea, frustrating execution"

The 'game' involves two gameplay elements: flipping through the included AR booklet to find the right page to aim your 3ds camera at to advance the story, the other is gyroscope-based combat against ghosts, turning round and round to get the enemy in your sights.  No exploration of a haunted mansion or village, nothing like that from traditional Fatal Frame's past iterations.The backdrop of the narrative portions is your own house, so while speaking to your spirit friend Maya or battling an evil ghost, you'll see such haunting background visuals as your kitchen stove or your cat or dog snoring on the couch next to a family member in your living room with the tv playing a rerun of Family Guy or something. It really destroys the suspension of disbelief that is necessary for a horror game. Again, the past games have provided an appropriate setting for a horror game (i.e a Japanese village or house) but Spirit Camera depends on your own place to create the atmosphere. Terrible. Are we supposed to go out of our way to find an abandoned building to play this game to get the proper atmostphere? Arent we paying $40 for the game to provide those things to the user? Again, because of this there is nothing to explore. You can even walk around. I think the player is supposed to be an immobile camera sitting on a tripod and not a human being with legs to walk around? Seems that way to me.Tecmo's original idea was to do a 3ds enhanced remake of the original Fatal Frame, but Nintendo Japan's president rejected the idea and opted for this half-baked tech demo-y thing instead. Way to give a bad impression of one of gaming history's few worthwhile horror series to the faithful fans who (I think) this game was aimed for...Other trivialities: the game can be finished in about 2 hours, and for some reason one of the bonus outfits is censored from the original Japanese version.

The best imo were the GBA and GBC versions. (I haven't forgotten the N64 or GC versions which were great in their own way but I'm comparing the handheld versions.)The handheld games had exhibition modes, a story mode, and bunch of mini-games. The most fun was the long story mode. You went to a tennis academy and started out as a noob. As you worked your way up the ranks you leveled up and could decide what stats you wanted to improve. All of that is gone in this game. I mean seriously, even the GC version had a story.There is pretty much only one mode in this game, exhibition. This is a Mario cart version of tennis. It's boring and I'm very disappointed. They also added some stupid chance shots which takes all the skill and fun away from the game. Doesn't matter what character you use, they are all generic now.

    Nintendo",2,"It's always with great childish anticipation I unfold and boot a new Mario game. Like the classic Kinder egg chocolate you expect something fun, something to play with and something to ""eat"". That requires content, however, and after playing Mario Tennis Open on and off for a few weeks it's glaringly obvious that there's not enough content to keep me satisfied.Sure, you have the usual silly-named tournaments against various characters in the Marioverse, you have a Mario shop to buy new stuff from and there are custom games in which you can play different challenges. None of that matter in the end because, to me, it felt like tacked-on variations of the same thing.*Repeatedly firing a combination of power shots against an easy AI is not fun.*Twitch-spamming buttons is not fun.*The music was driving me insane and there was no way to turn it off. Especially excruciating was the rock music that kicks in once you or the opponent have reached a game/set/match point.Developer Camelot has looked at real tennis and distilled it from just about everything but the players, serves and shots. You don't need rallies or tactics when you have the various circles to stand in and repeatedly smash fire balls up the opponent's creek. Why bother aiming your shots when everything goes in anyway, no matter where you stand and where you point at? After I quickly progressed through the tournaments I thought I got the hang of things, so I vent online for some Multiplayer shenanigans. MTO features local multiplayer of up to 4 people and online capabilites against people in your region.The first online attempt failed miserably. Perhaps my 3DS lost touch with reality or perhaps there are NO OTHER MTO PLAYERS available in the world after 9pm GMT; In any case, there was nobody around to accept my challenge. A few days later I made a second attempt: I will not bore you with details but.. I lost the match. I realised I totally and utterly suck at this game, my opponents handled the Fire Serves of Win and Smashing Balls of Win much better than I did. It was apparent that someone who doesn't spend an awful lot of time practicing these shots will not have any fun playing it online, which ultimately is crucial when the single player game is so thin around the bones. Something I also noticed was the considerable lag; which is curious since there seems to be very few players around actually bothering to play at certain hours.The Mario shop where you can purchase new outfits, rackets etc for your Mii is interesting to a certain point, the graphics are cutesy but don't benefit anything from turning up the 3D slide; another missed opportunity. It's not a totally bad game, just a very annoying and underwhelming one; there's not enough of the fun bits, there's not enough to play and the content doesn't last very long unless you want to endlessly grind coins for outfits or play online and continuosly be blasted to smithereens by someone's Mii.",Out of Line

And so they released a Gamecube sequel that added in offensive and defensive power shots as well as gimmick arenas, which was also quite successful. Did Nintendo succeed in bringing this success to the 3DS?My first impressions of the game on launch day were that the game seemed sloppily thrown together - and that impression still resonates with me. The character select screen in particualr seems very lazy. Instead of the usual board of characters, we get a scroll through list, and the characters even seen out of order.The controls are simple, and work fine. You move your character with the slide pad, and control shots with the buttons. You still have the same options you always have plus one need shot type. In addition to the ever present lob (A), slice (B), and the various options that come through their combination, you have smash shots (Y). Smash shots are fast, and straight. This game gets rid of the power shots introduced in Mario Power Tennis, and instead uses a system referred to a ""Chance Shots"". At random times, or if certain requirements are met, a small circle on the field will glow a particular color. The colors are coded along side the shot types, and using the correct shot type while in the circle will use the chance shot. For example, if there is a blue chance shot, and you slice the ball (B), the result is a super charged shot that curves outside the field and back into it. Alternatively, if it glows white, you can drop shot(B>A) for a super short drop shot. There is a chance shot for every type of hit in the game, and the most annoying has to be the purple ones. If a player uses the new smash shot while in a purple chance area, you're in for it. The player will spike a super fast fast ball straight down onto your court, and those with slow reflexes won't stand a chance.Chance shots may sound interesting, but they can quickly become annoying when playing against high level CPUs. It seems that in the higher difficulty tournaments, the computer will always get several chance shots in a row while you just play defense for a couple of minutes. You can call me childish or imamture, ro say that I jsut suck at the game all you want, but there's no getting around the facts - that is an annoying, cheap, and lazy way to make the game harder.In a never ending attempt to make their games more accessible, Nintendo has thrown in a couple of options for young and newer gamers. Rather than sue the buttons to select your shot type, you can simply tap the touch screen button with the color and name of the shot on it. They also added an option called simple shot, which can be activated via touch screen or by pressing (X). Simple shot will automatically use the most appropriate shot type for your current situation. The shot will be weaker than normal, but I still feel this is a bad idea and will prevent new players from taking to time to learn the real ins and outs of the game.As always, Nintendo has included some challenging minigames to occupy your time as well as unlock characters, as well as earn coins which you can sue to buy gear - we'll talk more about that in a moment. The minigames are, for the most part, quite challenging. They are very entertaining if you have nothing else to do, but once you've beaten all the difficulties and unlocked all the characters, you'll only be coming back to farm coins. My favorite minigame was Super Mario Bros Tennis, game in which the camera scrolls through a level of Super Mario Bros. world as you collect coins and kill enemies with the tennis ball.Another feature Nintendo has been including as of late is the ability to play as your Mii. Normally, I groan at this standard, as Mii's generally just annoy me and take away from the game's atmosphere. For the first time, I'm actually glad they included Miis ad playable characters - it is actually well executed. You can spend coins to buy clothing and rackets for your Mii, altering their stats into whatever suits you best (or whatever you think looks cool). You can even dress your Miis up in character costumes such as Bowser and Yoshi.Possibly the coolest new feature is the use of AR codes. Nintendo has been releasing Ar codes via Nintendo Power Magazine, their official Facebook page, and Club Nintendo which allow you to unlock characters in the game. While this certainly has potential,so far it has been wasted on nothing but some character outfits and some different colored Yoshis. Perhaps they will better utilize this feature in the future.This is the first Mario Tennis game to be playable online...er..that is that is able to be connected to Nintendo's Wi-Fi network. To say it is playable online would be an exaggeration. Lag and dropped connections are the norm no matter where I connect, be it at home, college, or even McDonalds, the online is simply unbearable.The graphics are honestly not that great, but there are worse looking games. Everything is fairly smooth and well animated, and as is to be expected of a Mario game the bright, pastel colors stand out nicely. The 3D effect made me a little dizzy, so I just turned it off. If you hold the 3DS vertical, the camera angle will switch to right behind your character, and the character will move a small amount on their own. I found this feature to be utterly useless, and the camera angle screwed me over more than it helped me. If you play this game lying down, the gyro censor will sometimes think you are holding the system vertical, and switch to this camera angle. The best option is to turn the feature off completely in the settings.Mario Tennis Open had a lot going for it as far as ideas are concerned, but the execution of these ideas is less than stellar. You'll have a much better time if you just buy Mario Power Tennis or even the original for the N64. If you are still adamant about getting this game, I recommend buying used and trying to find the best deal you can- it isn't entirely unworthy of your time, but it isn't worth the full $40, especially with all the other much better 3DS titles you could buy for that same price.",A huge letdown

    Nintendo",1,"I'm a huge fan of Mario Tennis games. When this one was announced for 3DS a while back, I was excited, especially since Camelot hadn't made one since the Gamecube. However, Mario Tennis Open is a watered down game with broken online and features that should be optional.The menus look identical to Mario Kart 7. Whether or not this was intentional to stylize these 1st party 3DS games, I do not know. You are only zgiven a few selections on this menu, including single and multiplayer, special games (minigames), and a Clubhouse where you can shop for items (that only work on your Mii, not the Mario characters) and change settings.On to the gameplay. There are a lot of quirks here. The characters look quite tiny on the 3DS's low res screen (400x240), and the 3D effect is non-existent. The framerate is super smooth...offline. Many of my online matches were very laggy, despite the 3DS being a few feet from my router and having a download speed of 15Mbps. Arguably the worst thing they did was make the chance shots non-optional. These are similar to the power shots in the Gamecube version, except you need to hit certain buttons to make them fully work (i.e., hitting B on a blue chance shot to create a power slice). What I hate about this is the fact that it's so broken. A novice or intermediate AI opponent can score on you easily with those shots, and don't even think about playing online because it's a game of luck. Whoever gets the chance shot first will win that point. Also, the gyroscope is awful. It turns itself back on even when you turn it off and save. And if you choose to use gyroscope controls online, it's almost a guaranteed win because you automatically go towards the ball; you just have to worry about hitting it.All in all, this game feels like another rushed 1st party title to save the dying 3DS. Yes, the 3DS has managed to sell 20+ million units, but this isn't because it's a rich and powerful system. It just has several 1st party titles (two being N64 remakes) that have pushed hardware sales. Mario Kart 7 lacked single player vs. mode (practicing with bots), and this game continues Nintendo's new precedent of rushing features that should be refined. Hopefully we'll see a 1.1 patch that fixes these problems soon. Otherwise I'll be selling this game.",Worst in the series. Avoid at all costs.

    Nintendo",1,"Imagine someone gives you a game. Then, as you start playing it, said person just dictates you to move here, attack there, and basically just orders you on how you should be playing it, instead of actually letting you play it however you want.Now, imagine all that... except have the actual GAME be the one giving the orders & being a pain!You can't catch ANY Pokemon, the graphics look worse then the GBA games, and the only 'strategy' they let you use is 'what direction do you want your attack to face?'. I'd say there is more strategic thinking required in the mystery dungeon games, except that let's you decide how you want to move/play for yourself.Then there's the fact that your Pokemon only has one attack! I like Eevee, Jigglypuff, etc, but when you've already beat the first few samurai/ gym leader people,& your Pokemon is still on the verge of kicking the bucket after 1-2 hits... It's just not fun.And the conquest part ends at the title. Your 'war lord' is quite a slacker. He/She doesn't do anything during the fight, except maybe the game's AI will let you use a potion once, & THAT'S IT. ...and you can only have 1 battle a month! when you can 'Choose' to battle, it's either with the wild Pokemon in the slums, or with the dorky looking Onimusha rejects at the next castle. Neither fight will do much good though, as all your Pokemon have some kind of growing defects...(sorry Eevee, but you really, really suck)...For anyone who wants a REAL strategic/take over the world game, Try the Brigandine game by Atlus (PS1). It has selectable warlords who can actually DO something, recruits that can team up with monsters (Ok, Eevee IS cuter then most of the dragons & demons, but that's the only advantage), And when you invade places, you can truly Conquer them.",Another flop by Nintendo

    Nintendo",2,"= Trial and error =If you haven't played Pikmin before, get ready for your creatures to die. I wasn't sure if they could go in water (water is everywhere) and there was an enemy in the water. They drown. I sent them after a boss, not knowing how to defeat it. I lost about 40 pikmin. Knowing the strategy, I reloaded my save and beat it properly, but with such long levels, trial and error is annoying.= Poor controls =The whole game is throwing pikmin at things. You point the cursor with the wiimote, and pikmin are thrown. Trouble is, they don't always get there. Two things can go wrong:1. the pikmin are thrown in an arc, but it's always the same arc, so they will hit a wall or other obstacle. No idea why they can't just land where you point. Instead you have to reposition your character so the angle is wide enough.2. you will miss by a few millimeters, and the pikmin will land in the background instead of the foreground, or vice versa.A lot of times you have to shoot flying enemies, but you can't just point at it; you have to know where to throw the pikmin so it will connect with the enemy mid-throw. It would make sense to just SHOW THE ARC like in A Boy and his Blob, or better yet, let me point at the thing I want to die.The camera is bad. You can zoom in, zoom out, and point the camera the way you're facing. There's no way to just turn it left or right, like in Mario Galaxy, which would be really useful.I gave this game another shot after getting bored with it a month ago, and there's no in-game way to see what the controls are, which is annoying because they're not exactly intuitive, beyond the basic shoot pikmin/call pikmin. Frankly I forgot what white pikmin do.Switching to different colored pikmin is annoying, and tapping A 30 times to kill something or pick something up isn't the best mechanic. Some people called this an RTS, and RTS games only work with mouse input (to select and command multiple units at once) and keyboard shortcuts for assigning and selecting groups.= No direction, bad map =A minimap would be great. I realize it's a sort of open world, where you can take multiple paths, but everything looks the same. Often I find I've gone in a circle when exploring a new area. Some direction would be helpful. Some uniqueness in the level design would be good, too. You're either in a rocky landscape or underground in a rocky cave.Sometimes they'll give direction, like ""look over here, a new pikmin"" and you'll have no idea how to get to the place they just showed. Again, an on-screen mini-map would be great.= Time limit =Once you start a level, you have a finite amount of time to complete it. I think it's about 15 minutes. So you have no idea which direction to go, and you have about fifteen minutes before the game starts hounding you to get back to your ship. This gets old, because about ten minutes in is when I start to figure out where I'm supposed to go in the level. So I can either reload a save, or start the level knowing where to go with a little less pikmin. Either way, playing the same stage over and over is boring.If you enter a cave, you have as long as you like. I get the explanation for why this is different (monsters come out at night, always dark inc aves) but I really don't see the practical reason for a time limit in a game about exploration. People get up in arms about this with Mario games but don't mind here.=Graphics=Not widescreen - 4:3 stretched. Someone above said it's widescreen. It's not. You can tell, because if you change your TV to 4:3 mode everything suddenly looks better. The graphics aren't great, and widescreen would've really helped. The pikmin are pretty small on my 42"" TV and it's sometimes hard to tell what they're doing.=Uhhh=The story is pretty dull. Your boss owes a bunch of money, so you need to mine garbage from another planet to pay off $10,000 in debts. You get a partner, who can lead another squad of pikmin, but is largely useless and his elimination could really free up another button.Pikmin are dumb and controlling them is tough. They happily walk into fires or drown in water without explicit orders.A game about deadlines and debts, superfluous coworkers and mindless employees, despite the foreign planet setting, is not much of a departure from real life.",Lazy port

    Nintendo",1,"Game & Wario, the latest entry in the very strange yet comparatively successful WarioWare series, aims to dethrone Nintendo Land as the Wii U party game of choice, but due to sloppy execution in both presentation and core gameplay mechanics across almost all of its 16 digitized vignettes, the end result is a pixelated manifestation of an opportunity ignored.  Game & Wario was initially conceived as a customary demonstrative package of some of the Wii U's snazziest features, and was at first planned to be preinstalled on its hard drive... much of it feels stylistically lazy and conceptually undercooked. Smooth development was hampered with apparent misdirection, stretched out and later unpunctually slapped with the Wario label, giving Intelligent Systems the excuse to go crazy with the content, as Wario-themed endeavors often rely on their off-the-wall tone and frenzied overture to attain the desired effect. Even if previous WarioWare efforts weren't all that visionary, they nonetheless managed to provide a significant amount of replay value that took quite awhile to begin the process of subsiding. Only a fraction of Game & Wario's 16 mini-games (12 single-player, 4 multiplayer-only), each spotlighting an anchor WarioWare character, are noteworthy, and the rest can be filed as fundamentally counterproductive attempts to find resourceful uses for the peripheral interplay between the screen of the Wii U's GamePad and your television set.Of the heavily imbalanced batch, ""Gamer"" implements the best usage of the Wii U's dual-panorama coaction, having players assume the role of avid Nintendo fanboy 9-Volt as he plays a number of 8-bit microgames on his treasured handheld under the covers. It's past the youngster's curfew, and his mother, 5-Volt, continually bursts into the bedroom, hollering at you to go to sleep. The goal is, naturally, to not get caught for as long as possible. The GamePad's display is host to a collection of diverting microgames, and the happenings in 9-Volt's room occur on the TV monitor. The exhibited synergy is utterly simplistic yet rather ingenious, sensibly and effectively leading your focal points astray while evoking nostalgia. (Seriously, what prepubescent gamer didn't spend late nights beneath blankets with their Game Boy?) The most durable WarioWare exploits, such as ""Gamer,"" rack the brain, but do so in a way that's inexplicably addictive, stopping short of crossing the line into controller-breaking frustration. ""Pirates"" and ""Taxi"" are also examples of this kind of inspired cleverness: The former is a feverish rhythm game that uses the GamePad as a sort of shield to deflect incoming directional indicators ordered by a mad Captain Wario, while the latter has easily distracted dog-and-cat cabbies Dribble and Spitz starring in a kinetic drive down Route 56. ""Taxi"" is the less inventive of the two, having a first-person windshield perspective on the GamePad and a map on the TV screen, but it decidedly has the least amount of diminishing returns, repeatedly offering a high degree of dynamism even in its preliminary stages.While these three minigames are enjoyable, their inventiveness doesn't carry over to the remainder of Game & Wario. The worst offenders in the single-player bracket are chronically dull, requiring only a few minutes to master and hardly tapping into Wii U's brimming reserve of versatile functionality; their unimaginative names basically discloses all you need to know. In ""Arrow"" you shoot arrows, in ""Bowling"" you bowl, in ""Design"" you draw, in ""Ski"" you ski, and in ""Shutter"" you take pictures, nothing more. Trudging through each is snooze-worthy from the outset, and it doesn't help that Game & Wario's sights and sounds exude an overwhelming air of flash-cartoon shabbiness.In the multiplayer department, the only red-letter enterprise is ""Fruit,"" an occasionally amusing whodunnit that has one player selecting a thief among a crowd of wandering citizens, periodically pulling off discreet apple swindlings, while the other players try to figure out who the culprit is. ""Disco"" is a dance game, but it lacks the finesse of the similarly-styled ""Pirates,"" ""Sketch"" is essentially a low-rent rip-off of Pictionary, and ""Islands"" is perhaps the laziest addition to the compendium, a half-assed take on the darts/marbles/horseshoes dynamic where players launch blockish Fronks at spinning scoreboards, knocking opponents off as they go in a lifeless contest that eventually boils down to who can stay interested the longest. Not much is worse in a modern minigame collection than the bane of instant redundancy emboldened by substandard visuals, and Game & Wario, unfortunately, sinks to that level in its primitive phases and seldom makes a forceful effort to systematically compensate for its laundry list of weaknesses.Basically, the game is boring, short & lacking content, and isn't worth your time - let alone your money.  I would barely classify this as a rental.  This could have easily been a digital download or free demo given out by Nintendo, and it's a shame they have packaged this as a $40 ""game.""","This Barely Classifies As A ""Game."""

    Nintendo",2,"I had high hopes for this game because it's part of Nintendo's staple series of Mario games. I ignored the reviews that said that the game was too hard and complicated because, well...it's a Mario type game, how hard could it be? Unfortunately, this is a really hard game. I am pretty experienced at playing hard core games, and this is being marketed as a casual game, but it's level of difficulty is frustrating. I doubt a child could play this, I am an adult and find myself overly frustrated by the purposefully difficult levels that were designed into the game and the general lack of thought put into the story of the game. Been playing this a while and I still don't quite know what the plot or story is, just playing through the map of levels. Nintendo could have made this a great game, the case is green and it truly stands out when you look for games, it's price is cheap compared to the Mario game, and it looks like a lot of fun, but unless you intend to spend hours replaying levels you have already beaten because the game designer decided to over complicate them, skip this game title.",Surprised At This Game

That was until I played the game,then everything started to make sense. The game has been  made to sound better than it actually is by a lot of teenagers who spend 90% of their year on half term,they're socially inept,extremely boring and quite nerdy and when they're not reading Shakespeare they're going to play low budget racing games with low frame rates and even lower pixels. Not too dissimilar to anything else nintendo has ever churned out before,but because they don't know any better and this is seen to be good by them they'll just keep coming back for more. Other reviewers have praised the graphics saying &#34;they're as smooth as butter&#34; I have the truth for you right here. The graphics are as smooth as sandpaper that's been coated with broken glass. I know that's going to appeal to some people out there but it's not supposed to sound good. It was never my intention to make this game sound good because that would just be wrong. The Nintendo wii u just isn't powerful enough to play any games on,It seems like as the world evolves Nintendo's games consoles don't. It's almost as if the wii u is just a Super Nintendo with a different cover. Some people might be fooled by the TV ads saying &#34;new power ups&#34; I say they're not new they just look different because they're now a different colour than they used to be. Just because something looks different it doesn't mean it is. It's just in disguise. This game would be perfect for families if they consisted of children below the age if 3 and the parents would have to have a mental age to match. Dull colours don't help sell this game either it looks like &#34;Dark Souls Kart&#34; it's so dark and gothic colour wise, they've probably made it dark to hide the low frame rate problem that exists,but I saw right through it and this is my opportunity to expose these flaws to the world. I also noticed another review where the reviewer was screaming the praises of the feature that let's you spend hour after hour watching replays of the game. Why would anyone want to do that ? Surely even a gamer has got more self respect than to sit at his wii u watching replays of Mario kart 8 for hours,hasn't he/she ? Maybe I give them too much credit that they obviously don't deserve.Well, that's it from the worlds favourite games reviewer.until next time.Calm Down SonFreedom Of SpeechKnowsBest",Low-Budget Box-Kart

    Nintendo",2,"I have played every Mario Kart game since they started on Super Nintendo. This is where I am ending it.To be fair, this game does have some good levels and large selection of characters, but that does not count for this game's major flaws.What Mario Kart 8 did wrong:1. The minimap is not on the TV where it should be, it is on the gamepad. If you use the gamepad, you need to look down at the map to see where everyone is, by the time you look back up at the TV, you ran into a wall or something. Not to mention, if you are not even using the gamepad, you don't get the minimap at all. This could have been fixed if you play on the gamepad itself, the screen is wide enough to fit the game and the map side by side, but they decided that more people would like to use the horn for your kart instead of actually seeing what you are doing indicated by 2 tiny screens on the right side of the gamepad.2. The camera is just awful during anti gravity racing. It keeps making me want to play F-Zero where the camera stays behind you the whole way, this one just sucks.3. This is a disc-based game, they should have put as many shortcuts to certain parts of the game as possible. For example, when you get a really bad start on the 1st or 2nd race, you want to start the grand prix over. On this one, you need to quit, wait for it to load, select your options (loads during every transition and sometimes gets stuck on the character select screen because the disc can't find the character you want to select fast enough), select your options, select your cup, then wait like 30 seconds. In Mario Kart 64, you had shortcuts to everything during gameplay when you pressed start which was sometimes unnecessary because cartridges are instantaneous. Even if you play a download copy of Wii U games, the harddrives still take forever to load.4. The game's difficulty is not based on skill, they are based on luck. In this game, regardless of how well you play, the game will make sure to destroy you completely at the end just before winning a race. You could be in 1st place, get hit by blue shells, lightning bolts and red shells so 3 or 4 computers can pass you. Mario Kart DS and earlier never had that problem.5. Finally, there is no snaking, there wasn't any snaking in Mario Kart 7 or Wii either, but this game you need it. 15 players against you exclusively, you need some advantage to make sure you can still win after getting slaughtered at the finish line. I know that Nintendo made power-sliding based on a timer rather than skills in rocking the control pad and strictly being faster with the controller than others, but why compensate for people that can't do that? For the last 6 years or so, Nintendo has been bending over backwards for people who just simply aren't good at the harder games.***6. Also, reintroducing the coin system was a pain. Get 10 coins to go full speed, that is fine, but you lose coins way too easily and the computers usually take them before you can.***7. Also, the music is just not fitting for Mario Kart. It is like arcade music sort of. In arcades (that thing that died in the United States and was a room with 100's of cabinets of games and is popular everywhere in Japan), there is a lot of noise all around you that on your particular game except for like DDR or MaiMai or Beatmania, you can't really hear your game's music except for the drums or something. The song composition is just unappealing and doesn't feel like it belongs in this game. Also, I don't understand the freeform jazz or swing music.To be fair, this game is playable, but if you rely on skills you have learned in the first 4 or 5 Mario Kart games to win in this one, you will hate this game. For me, I put this game back in the box and put it with the games that will never be played again. I am not even looking at the Wii U until Smash Brothers comes out.I am sure that if anyone sees the score I gave, my review will not even be read, I will just get flamed because they don't like my opinion, but that is what a review is, an opinion and why I came up with it.",I am done with Mario Kart. 3 bad games in a row.

    Nintendo",1,"6 years by golly.  6 long years I've awaited with baited breath for this fine sequel to that fine predecessor that was Mario Kart Wii.  I rushed my package from the door right to my Wii.  My hands shook so violently with the anticipation that I nearly took a doctor's prescribed pill to settle my nerves then i reminisced ever so quickly that such an act would render my finer acuities and reactions to a dullard pitch of unresponsiveness.  So I trusted my fragile psyche would handle the overwhelming overload of sheer emotionalism as I waited for the load screen to appear.But all for naught.  My Wii sat there perched upon my entertainment center spinning the disc a few times and then the big viola of nothingness.  I hit the eject button on the off hand chance I put the silly thing in upside down.  But nope.  after back in it went still nothing.  I dreaded that my Wii finally gave out after all those games of Carnival Games and Bowling.  So I put in Metroid and that worked.  Zelda too.  But each and every time I place Mario Kart 8 in there ain't a doggone thing occurring.  Heck, I even tried blowing on the disc old-school style.  Still it don't play.Anybody know why?  I tried reaching out to Nintendo.  As I sat on the hold line for 15 minutes I kept thinking over and over why Nintendo would even wait 6 years to release a sequel when all they really need to do is set a few designers down to come up with some more tracks and slap different colors on the side of the carts.  Not like these games don't just about make themselves with what little true innovation comes along and gets stretched out over 20years of this particular franchise.Either way I just hope they figure out what ever problem I'm having cause I hear there is a sequel to Super Smash Brothers after 7 plus years.",Is mine broken or did somebody forget to tell me something

    Nintendo",1,"The game is well done graphically, the visuals are wonderful, the new 3d style is well done again graphically and the fun factor is decent.  Compared to the awesome control of Mario U im still trying to get used to the controls in a 3d style as for me Mario will always be a 2d game regardless of how good the graphics are. In this game and Mario U they are stunning but this game is hard to navigate as it's damn near impossible to determine where you going to land....again I love the smooth controls and camera angles of Mario U.  The multiplayer is kind of fun, my wife and I tried to enjoy it but it gets frustrating quickly for the control/camera limitations I mentioned above.  Once again going through the levels together is tough and if you get a little ahead of the other player(s) it kills you all or bubbles everyone which is very annoying.  The next thing is the cat suit power up, its way to overused like in every level, where are the racoon suits?  If you die 5 times in a level you get the while tanookie suit rendering you invincible save from pit falls which this whole game is.....  Overall Mario U is all you need for a great new Mario game this one is a real dud, it tries to pride itself on nestalgia but fails and the levels range from easy as hell to damn near impossible again due to the 3d mess of the controls and camera angles.

Assets are re-used and the most infamous of the re-used assets is a single track of music. With the exception of boss battles, all this game has is one song.

That alone makes it feel as if this game was stripped of something that made it so magical when the first one came out on the Super Nintendo.The egg throwing was very annoying. The fact Yoshi takes as much time to prepare his eggs to be thrown slows down the game and becomes very aggravating.The game does attempt to shake things up by utilizing tilt control when Yoshi gets one of his vehicle powerups. These become difficult to control sometimes and at times makes you wish you could just use the joystick. It's a shame that there's a touch screen on the 3DS, but this game doesn't take advantage of it at all in any way.

I felt like I was in the Caribbean or South Pacific when playing this game.  The controls seem pretty easy to learn and use.  I like that you have the opportunity to use all the characters through-out DK series.  The first three levels are fun because it's challenging, the graphics are beautiful and the music is great.Here's the problem-  it is suitable for all ages, but not playable for all ages.  You need to be a full time gamer that doesn't work to complete this game 100%.  I love how Donkey Kong evolved over the past 35 years into a lovable character; one of my favorite Nintendo characters.  The makers should have taken into consideration the age group and adjusted the difficulty.  I like challenges, but some stages are almost unwinnable to the average gamer.  The problem is that some stages have a tiny degree of error and you would lose several times over to complete the stage.  I was able to complete 90%, but that because I gave up on the 5th temple stage;almost impossible.  The fun factor went down because the degree of difficulty made the game frustrating.The controls are simple, but if you don't have fadst fingers; you will lose...alot.  Again, some areas you have about 1-2 seconds to react and think.  You will have to lose alot to know the pattern and move on.  My tween girls gave up on stage three so I traded it in to Game sTop for a good price ($32.00).  I like a challenge, but there is a fine line that the makers past.Disappointing!!!So hard core DK fans...don't hate and say my review is not helpful because you disagree like many of you in my God of War 2 review.

The gameplay is tired and boring, the concept is lame as there is so much more that could be done like bowser/wario/Eggman teaming up and having the selection of Mario/sonic characters in a great Mario U style platformer that would be awesome but this is a waste.",I love my Wii u but I hate this series.

    Nintendo",2,"I loved the wii-fit.  I thought wii-fit plus improved on that.  But although the wii-fit-U has potential, it has more negatives than positives.  If you already have the wii-fit plus, I would NOT recommend upgrading.Positives:- You can save 3of your own &#34;routines&#34;- There are some new mini-games- The pedometer will sync to the game, and show a history of what you've doneNegatives- Many of the old mini-games are GONE (&#34;big top&#34; balance/juggle game, beach segway game, balance and catch fish, and others)- When you go through any of your own routines that you created, it is much slower due to having to hit &#34;A&#34; through a lot of messages and pausing between each exercise.  It's annoying and it really increases the time to do a simple set of exercises.  Plus you have to keep a remote either in your hand or close by.- I'm on my 2nd meter and the attempt to record altitude just doesn't work well at all.  I wish it did, it would motivate me to use the stairs more.- There is a problem when you replace the battery on the meter.  I've found others report this same problem on the Nintendo forums, so it's not just mine.  I had problems with my first meter, it would occasionally say the battery had been replaced (it hadn't)  and when this happened the wii-fit would consider me a new user during the weigh-in.  Not a BIG deal, just annoying and time-consuming.  But then that became permanent (it goes together with a message from the animated board &#34;is it just me or have we gone back in time&#34;).All my data is there if I look at the graphs, but every time I do the daily weigh in I have to get all the extra messages for a new user!  And always do the intro-balance game ... never any others.  Everyday it wants me to set a weight goal (it wont remember the one from yesterday).  This is VERY annoying and time consuming to do every day.I expect this problem will become more common as other people's batteries get changed.Calling Nintendo was no help, they claim to have no record of the problem (though you can find questions on their forums back to 2011, and some very recent ones with it resurfacing due to the meter).The only fix seems to be to create a new user - which is VERY annoying.  I lose all my data back to 2008, have to open up the advanced options of all exercises.  I can't &#34;just&#34; recreate my exercise routines because some exercises aren't available to me as a new user.So before this major set back with making a new user, i'd have given it a 3 or a 4 star.  Worth it if you don't already own the wii-fit plus, or if you love tracking your walking within the game.  I regretted buying the wii-U just so i could upgrade this game, even before i had to create a new user.I can't give it one-star because I still am a fan of wii-fit in general.  So if you don't own any version of the game ... you don't have the risk of losing years of data, so it's worth getting (if you already own the Wii-U and balance board).I'm still holding out hope Nintendo fixes the problems - the game does have potential to be an improvement.","Initially Disapointing, then VERY frustrating"

    Nintendo",2,"We bought this mainly for the remote but also thought the game looked like lots of fun.  The blue remote is great and I'm glad I have it but we really didn't enjoy the game at all.  We tried the Questions and Answers and it's a bunch of really short games that are hard to figure out.  Every game requires different controllers so you're constantly switching controllers.  Some require the nunchuck, some use the game pad and some don't.  I think it would be fine switching back and forth if the games were more than about 1 minute long and actually fun to play.  When you go from a game where someone is using the game pad to a motion plus controller it took us awhile to get the players set up again.  I didn't see any way how this could end up being enjoyable for a party because everyone wouldn't be able to figure out the controls for the numerous short games.  Party games should be much easier for people to understand, pick up and play or it just wont be fun for anyone.  I think we tried one other mode and also didn't enjoy it so we just gave up.  I've since sold the game and kept the remote.  You'd be better off buying just the remote separately or another controller/game bundle such as wii party u w/ black controller or Nintendo land plus luigi remote.  I'm shocked at how many 5 star reviews there are for this bundle!",Games are too short and hard to learn for a party.  Overrated!

    Nintendo",1,"Yet another day and another abysmal Aonuma Zelda is defecated out upon our collective heads.Where to begin?Gameplay:1. Overly easy: challenge free gameplay that makes Celda Wand Wacker Teletubby Island (some erroniously refer to this game as ""Zelda Wind Waker"") gameplay come off like Ninja Gaiden in comparison. Seriously you will NEVER die in this game, not even ONCE, not even if you are a lobotomy patient!2. Items: No need to possess any actual skill, just go around and hack up some bushes (Eiji Aonuma's favorite gameplay element from LTTP incidentally) and collect enough rupees and you can buy everything that you used to have to search for (in the superior Pre-Aonuma Zelda's ie Zelda 1-4) in order to find. Just pay that stupid Ravio creature for it and you'll get everything from the hookshot to the boomerang with no risk at all to your character's health.3. Lame gimmick: which turns you into a wall painting, the true purpose of which is not to expand the gameplay elements of the Zelda series in any meaningful way but just another arrogant and obnoxious attempt by Eiji Aonuma to force his disgusting and deformed art style version of Link down our collective throats. The guy simply will not learn his lesson that the Zelda fanbase utterly rejects his chibi art style as well the Saturday morning cartoon presentation for Zelda. In the year 2013 we demand realism NOT sub par dumbed down graphics that appeal to the soccer mom and kintergarten set. We especially desire beautiful epic graphics and sophisticated art styles because we are paying for these expensive overpriced game machines to play these type of games on and we want to see some actual visual performance for our money. In anycase Aonuma doesn't just need to be fired by Nintendo, Nintendo should of never hired him to begin with.4. Recharge bar: for all the Nintendo fanboy whining about the dominance of the ""dudebro"" first person shooter (FPS) games dominating the world of videogames these days and arguably dumbing it down as a result Eiji Aonuma has ripped off this feature from the Halo series but instead of providing a shield for Link Aonuma has used HIS recharge bar newly added gameplay element to make the game even easier than it already was since now you no longer have to find magic vials or arrows while adventuring out in the world the bar just recharges automatically after you shoot some arrows or use an item such as say the lantern. Seriously Aonuma will not be satisfied until Nintendo allows him to add a dedicated ""win button"" to Zelda.-Continued pushing of Nintendo's politically correct LGBT agenda by featuring a decidedly homosexual character in a Bunny rabbit suit named Ravio. Ravio is a human character dressed in a bunny suit that helps your character Link throughout the game by offering him various ""tools"" (note the subconscious innuendo there)...Anyway I believe the proper term for this sort of sexual fetish means of dress up role play is called being a ""furry"" if I'm not mistaken? Whatever the case its incredibly sick and inappropriate for children to be exposed to a freak like Ravio in this sort of ""E for everyone"" style game. I'm quite certain Nintendo's featuring of this sick and unsavory degenerate character of Ravio is along the same lines as how the tobacco companies used to use the Joe camel character to push young children into smoking. Well Nintendo obviously wants to encourage young people to become homosexuals which doesn't make any sense since the left generally says such people are born and not made. In anycase creepy and inappropriate character design by Nintendo/Aonuma here and thats not a judgement of being anti gay or even anti furry it is simply a desire for cohesiveness and congruency ie a movie about Martin Luther King Jr. would not be at all served in it's contexual believability by having a white man play the part of Dr. King, likewise homosexual characters and furry fetishists simply do not belong in the context of a midieval sword and sorcery action adventure which The Legend Of Zelda always was, up until the moment that is the untalented hack Eiji Aonuma got involved in it's development. Now much like with society Aonuma has destructively turned Zelda into an ""anything goes"" free for all where trains, robots, homosexuals, furries and other inappropriate set pieces are placed in a game world where they simply do not belong.-Rehashing Zelda: A Link To the Past's overworld maps in order to try and trick the Zelda fanbase into believing that Zelda is returning to it's glorious form from the past, when really this game is just another Aonuma turd that would've been better off not being made at all.What Zelda as a series and game franchise desperately needs is Yoshiaki Kozuimi or Takashi Tezuka in the director's chair for it ever as a series to return to health.To conclude and re-state my own review title over again because its THAT important to say it twice...Eiji Aonuma is a cancer on the Zelda series and must be excised for the Zelda series to ever become well again.I rated this game a 1 star because to my knowledge it simply could not be rated lower in Amazon's system.",Eiji Aonuma is a cancer on the Zelda series

    Nintendo",1,"I bought this game expecting to crawl through dungeons, open treasure chests, and rent weapons?! Yes, in this game you rent weapons instead of finding them (saves time but not rupees). Also, the big villain is an art maniac.  It's not enough for him to try to steal the Triforce, but he has to turn everyone into graffiti. Also, never use parallel worlds as part of the story line. They're a good idea in theory, but in use are awkward and never work. I guess I was expecting too much, I should have paid more attention to the 7+ age rating. Good for young kids, disappointing for veterans.",Renting weapons is not cool

To make this worst, you have to travel through five parallel worlds, all  with the same bosses. That's right, you don't just get to fight the boss once but actually five times. Hope you like repetition.  The only redeeming fact of this game is the battle system. The system is a traditional turn base system only with a twist to make it interesting.
