    H&R Block",80.99,"03 17, 2014","The program guides you through the process and does an accuracy review as well as likelihood of audit analysis. I did my own taxes which included business expenses and felt the business part could have been more explicitly laid out. I also filed for my girlfriend who has limited income and the program did great job of including earned income credit which I had not encountered before based on my income level not qualifying. It was difficult to go back and ensure I had input withheld taxes properly. I was able to figure it out, however. My girlfriend had been told by the father of one of her children that she could deduct him but when we e-filed the IRS rejected because the child had already been claimed. We confirmed that was the case and it was easy (although financially less positive, of course) to revise file and resubmit to IRS. Overall, I am pleased. Have used for last 3 years now and likely to continue to use.",Easy to Use and E-File

I gave this a 4-star rating because the help info is so basic it is barely useful...consult the IRS website for more details.  It is easy to navigate the IRS website and find information.  Also, you have to download software in order to save the return as a PDF.",Good enough

    H&R Block",80.99,"02 13, 2014","I've been using the H&R product for many years, as long as it has been available.  It works well and easy enough even for people like myself who have more complex tax situations with rentals, depreciation and stock sales.  It inputs last year's data as starting point for this year's taxes which is a major time saver.  I have close to 75% completion in one step since I keep the files and have good records.

My complaint would be that the help files used to be of a higher more complete quality. I used to spend a good deal of time going through the help files learning the tax code.  They have been dumbed down quite a bit.

I use the NY state program.  It uses almost all of the Fed data so completion is quite quick.

Electronic filing is pretty straight forward and I've used that method for years.  It does require you check and recheck that your return has been accepted.  I've never had a problem, but if anyone has, they should post here and let us know how it was resolved.",Easy enough to use.  Used to have better and more complete help files

    H&R Block",80.99,"02 4, 2014","This software is somewhat helpful in preparing the tax forms for my self-employment business, but it is also frustrating and confusing.  For me, the most valuable benefit of purchasing this Premium tax package is being able to get tax help and technical help from live people. After years of preparing my tax returns by hand, I find that entering data in the way that this software requests it is confusing.  That's probably just my issue.

Trying to submit a tax question through the web link provided in the software was an exercise in absolute frustration.  I think that Internet Explorer 11 was stopping my attempts to login at the Block site, but when I called Block for tech support the very polite man who tried to help me was unable to resolve this problem.

He did give me an alternative way to request tax help through the on-line tax prep site, but apparently, the on-line software asks for data input differently than the downloaded software, so the woman who was helping me was initially confused why I wasn't able to see the same screens she saw.  Fortunately, she consulted with a co-worker and was able to answer my question.

Correctly entering the particular data I was asking about required reading a note in a panel on the right side of the screen.  If I didn't have experience entering this data by hand in the past I would not have known that the software was perfectly willing to let me enter a deduction that exceeds IRS limits and legally it would have been my error, not Block's, because I didn't read the note in the side panel.  I will give Block kudos for knowing the correct dollar limit on this deduction even though the IRS has not yet released the publication that provides this limit and an IRS Help Line person was unable to provide it to me when I called.

We'll see what happens when we submit our return. Hoping not to get those adjustments by the IRS for errors that we've had in previous years.","Reasonable software, Good support"

The initial installation went very smoothly.  I then downloaded the updated files and forms.  I have a cable connection but it took rather a long time.  During the download, the process seemed to stall for a long time but eventually everything downloaded and updated properly.  Doing the program itself was easy - you are taken through an ""interview"" process in which you are asked to supply the information and numbers required to complete your return.  Piece of cake!  I supplied the information, printed out my return and checked it over, and it looks good.  Throughout the session you are kept informed of what the program is trying to do, and are given applicable links to click if you (the user) needs more information about the interview item.
Negatives: I updated the forms and files before the interview process brought up the subject.  When the interview suggested it, I clicked the button again and it seemed like the program froze.  There was no download status or other status box telling me what happened and when I clicked on other links, nothing happened.  I couldn't close the program, either (Windows XP) - the only way I could get out was to tell XP to turn off the whole computer, not just the program.  Maybe this happened because I already downloaded the update?  I don't know.  The other negative is that during the final check it gave me a warning that my FICA withheld was more than the the 6.2% limit, but that was not the case.  Maybe a rounding error?

During that period I have also once used TurboTax (2000), so I also have some idea of what that program has to offer.  For all but the most complicated returns TaxCut works very well.  The interview process is straightforward and reasonably thorough.  There are a few very specialized forms that are missing, e.g., 8582-CR (needed for a low income housing investment and other so-called ""passive activities""; a hilarious IRS oxymoron if ever there was one).  TaxCut generally costs about $10 less than TurboTax and has not had the activation and spyware issues that TurboTax has had.  Over the years I have filed some fairly complicated returns and have always found TaxCut up to the task.  This year's version is no different, with several forms of on line help to make it easier to understand IRSeese and decide what would be best for your particular situation.

By the way, some of the problems that Ioannis C. Tzamouranis ""yannis_tzamouranis"" reported a few reviews back probably were caused by having his system fonts set for large fonts.  I had the same problem until I changed my system to small fonts.  TaxCut should tell users how to fix this problem.  Better yet the program should detect the system fonts setting and automatically correct its display.",About the same as previous years: very good

Using TaxCut was a decent experience. The program itself is easy to use and negotiate. Jumping back and forth in the return was a fairly simple process. There were significant improvements over the previous year's version. Which is always a welcome thing.

I was able to quickly import my tax info from the previous year's TurboTax files without any problem. The user interface is easily understandable. Overall, TaxCut seems to be a step or two behind TurboTax. But the end results are the same, a tax refund which more than pays for the program. And those steps behind are small steps.

Keep in mind that the ""free"" state version (which you have to pay for and get reimbursed), and any rebates, require that you send in receipts within 30 days of the purchase. If you don't then you'll not be getting any rebates or reimbursements.",A good program for tax prep... not great.

43351,4,H&amp;R Block,20.5,"02 23, 2005","I originally wrote this review thinking that TaxCut did something wrong in calculating home depreciation for my wife's home business that was started and stopped in 2004.  However, I got an email from the IRS today stating that I cannot claim home depreciation for businesses placed in service and disposed of in 2004.

Pub 946, Page 6 under 'Excepted Property'

To check to see if TaxCut would calculate it correctly if I said I started the businessin 2003, I went back to the interview and changed my business start date to 1/12/2003.  After I did this TaxCut correctly calculated my depreciation as expected.

That was the only issue I had with TaxCut.  And this is not really an issue since TaxCut was right all along.  Kudos to TaxCut for covering all the details, unlike their competitor, TurboTax, which I found 2 major bugs in their software that they try to deny. One bug is that TurboTax gave me the home depreciation credit for my part year business.  This is not correct according to Pub 946.  I would have increased my chances of being audited by Uncle Sam if I filled with TurboTax.

I am so glad I was able to return TurboTax back to the store and exchange it for TaxCut.  TaxCut blows TurboTax out the water.  I will never even think about purchasing TurboTax again, they think their software is perfect, when really its not.  Then when you report errors, they tell you, that YOU did something wrong.

TaxCut gets an B+, with my only complaint being that the interview could be a bit more decriptive and tell you EXACTLY what is happening to the figures you type in to it.  If it had done that in I never would have questioned why I didn't get a home depreciation credit in the first place.

In hindsight, I think I may have wasted my money on Complete Home & Business.  I think I could have sufficed with TaxCut Platinum, since the only business we had last year was a home daycare.  TurboTax didn't even prompt me to use the business CD that was included.  Oh well, theres always EBAY.  And also I did need to use ""Ask a Tax Advisor"" for some help.  And I well get a rebate of the cost since I bought ""Complete Home & Business"".

As it turns out, for me at least, some of the more the ominous Taxcut feedback (the ones with single stars) was mostly hype.
My return is moderately complex, with regular and passive income, capital gains, itemized deductions, carryover losses etc. At the end of the day, Taxcut handled it all fine. Here are some positives that address some of the negative feedback:
1. Imported last year's TurboTax data perfectly. There was one minor glitch in interpreting it, which I'll explain below.
2. Performed two online updates via dialup, one via LAN, they all worked fine
3. Properly handled the carryover loss, which had to be treated differently for Fed and State
4. Interview worked fine - never ran into a question like ""please fill in form X""
5. Navigation through fields worked fine with the Tab key and arrows
6. E-filing worked great. Yeah the return got rejected a couple of times because Taxcut didn't ask me to fill in fields that the IRS and FTB wanted, but the error status pointed me right to the problems and I fixed them easily, and re-filed.

1. The program crashed about 5 or 6 times while completing my return, mostly when I was bouncing around between different sections. While annoying, I never lost data, in fact Taxcut seems to retain data even if you don't save the file manually.
2. When you e-file, you use your last year's AGI as an electronic signature. Taxcut pulled the wrong figure (gross income vs. AGI) from my TurboTax data.

The programs share several annoying flaws:
1.  Neither works right on a network, which is nonsense; lots of people have home networks for sharing printers, internet connections, etc., and it is often convenient to do at least some work on one's business computer.  In the case of TT, given their piracy paranoia, I presume this is intentional, so lots of people at an office can't share a single copy on a network.  What's TaxCut's excuse?  TurboTax at least tells you, up front, that they ""don't support"" use on a network.  Tax Cut doesn't (or, if it does, I missed it).
2.  The quality and quantity of help and technical support have been going down year by year in TurboTax, whether within the program, by phone, or on their web site.  This year, TaxCut is no better, help-wise, than TT (dunno about past years for TC, since, until this year, I was a loyal TurboTax user).  Neither is really acceptable this year if you have a problem, and neither is as good as TurboTax was a few years ago.  I encountered problems with both programs that I only managed to fix because of people on newsgroups and boards--no thanks to Intuit or Block.  At TurboTax, things may be slightly worse, simply because they're having to devote so many resources to dealing with product activation problems.  But Tax Cut is no great shakes in the help/tech support areas.  And past TurboTax experience suggests that both will only get worse as April 15 gets closer.
3.  Both TT and TC are obnoxious about hawking their other programs/services/tie-ins.
I find the TaxCut interview process slightly better designed than TurboTax's, as I didn't have to mindlessly click ""no"" to inapplicable questions as much with TaxCut as with TurboTax.  TaxCut also makes it easier to deal directly with forms.  For people who don't know what they're doing, but don't have ultra-simple returns, TurboTax's more mindless approach may be better.

I'd give Tax Cut a very slight edge on functionality, and it's considerably cheaper.  If you don't object to Intuit's product activation nonsense, I'd still give TaxCut an endge.
Of course, I *do* object, very, very strongly, to TurboTax's product activation nonsense.

It includes easy navigation to return to sections of your return not yet completed. TaxCut is better than the popular TurboTax since TaxCut doesn't install resource-wasting spyware and because TaxCut is cheaper. My one complaint is that TaxCut prompts you to ""update"" the software before u file the return. This is a mjor problem if your internet connection is 56k dial-up since the update is 14MB.

I will pay for it again this year, but you would think that software used by this many people would have more than two competitors.

The only flaw that I can see with TaxCut is the state filing. When installing and loading the State version, I get a message to install an update to get the latest information. When I click the ""Update Now"" button, I'm told I have the latest update - BUT I can't go any further in the State preparation until I ""Update Now."" A 10 minute search on the TaxCut website reveals that some states do not have the latest information available, and you can't use TaxCut State (if your state is one of those) until the update is available - mid-February for me.

Upon starting a return, the user is prompted to answer simple questions during an ""interview"" phase. After a few yes/no responses and some data entry (assuming you don't use Quicken or Money), your return is complete. It includes easy navigation to return to sections of your return not yet completed. TaxCut is better than the popular TurboTax since TaxCut doesn't install resource-wasting spyware and because TaxCut is cheaper. My one complaint is that TaxCut prompts you to ""update"" the software before u file the return. This is a mjor problem if your internet connection is 56k dial-up since the update is 14MB. With a broadband connection, however, this isn't a concern.

However, it's not so great a product that I'd bother with its non-value adding hurdles - I've got better things to do with my time, like my taxes.
TaxCut is good - not as good as TurboTax in my opinion.  Still, it imported my TurboTax file without a hitch and I did my federal and state taxes in about an hour.  However, there was some bugginess with updating the state tax forms - it took a few tries.

I will pay for it again this year, but you would think that software used by this many people would have more than two competitors.

I have no issues with TT's decision to use copy protection, but spyware (which does not uninstall if/when you uninstall TurboTax) crosses the line.

The only flaw that I can see with TaxCut is the state filing. When installing and loading the State version, I get a message to install an update to get the latest information. When I click the ""Update Now"" button, I'm told I have the latest update - BUT I can't go any further in the State preparation until I ""Update Now."" A 10 minute search on the TaxCut website reveals that some states do not have the latest information available, and you can't use TaxCut State (if your state is one of those) until the update is available - mid-February for me.

I didn't buy the state version because the Michigan state tax form is pretty much a no brainer to fill out since you get very few deductions and once you have your AGI all you have to do is calculate the tax due. I mainly needed a tax program that would figure out if any AMT  was due. The IRS paperwork for the AMT is confusing to me and I wanted a program that would do the work for me.

 I saw some other posts about people having problems installing taxcut and having it lock up at 21%. On the Taxcut website they talk about not having a certain font package on your computer will cause the lock up. Therefore, I downloaded and installed the font package first. Then I installed Taxcut and away I went. I ran the update manager first which took some time at my painfully slow 28.8 connection, but got through it in about a half hour.

The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is that there are too many commercials for H&R block services and the donations portion was weak because it limited the amount of donation spaces to log in your donations. Therefore, I had to group the donation which was a little bit of a pain and because it thought the donations needed a special form because it exceeded some limits. And for some reason it wanted to know if they donations were post 9/27. This became a slight problem with grouping the donations.

I did have some difficulty with the update process, which was frustrating at first. However, I found Taxcut's website to be helpful on this point, and I determined that my firewall was the problem. I was able to update the product once I followed their instructions.

One key difference between Turbotax and Taxcut was that Taxcut is not integrated with as many companies. Whereas I could automatically download my W-2 and most of my 1099 forms into Turbotax, they needed to be manually entered with Taxcut. This wasn't a huge issue, but one difference people might want to know.

I completed and e-filed multiple federal returns, which worked great, and the e-file charge was reasonable ($15.95). However, I don't suggest having the e-file charge taken out of your refund. Apparently, there's an extra charge (I think $25) for this service. It's more efficient and less expensive to just pay the fee with a credit card.

Now to the software itself. I found it easy to navigate and enter information. I was a bit disappointed in the deduction section. Many of the fields were too short for me to enter complete names and addresses of charities, which I found frustrating. However, the calculations were accurate. I checked Taxcut's calculations regarding AMT, and they were excellent (Turbotax's calculations were wrong). In the second return I completed, the taxpayer was eligible for EIC, and Taxcut accurately identified this and did the proper calculations here as well.

Overall, I was very satisfied with the product, and will use it again next year.

In the past I have found ""It's Deductible"" to be intuitive and comprehensive -- a breeze to use but this year there appears to have been some changes which have made it clumsy, difficult to read and navigate, and generally confusing.  When I purchased DeductionPro as an alternative I was pleased to find a program that was actually pretty simple and easy to use.  The only problem is that information compiled in DeductionPro only imports into TaxCut.

For those of you who have never used a deduction tracker, I want to tell you that they are absolutely incredible.  The premise is that as a donor, you don't know the True value of the donated items.  For example, what's an old shirt worth???  $1?  I don't know.  These programs do.  The most important thing to do is to enter complete data throughout the year.

The interface for DeductionPro is very-good overall.  I donated about 100 books, bedding, clothing, a fax machine, and a printer.  The program surprised me with the depth of detail w/r/t the books.

I had no problems with the installation, and my files from last year's TurboTax return imported just fine.

In comparison to TurboTax, I found it to be very similar. They ask the same types of questions with TaxCut, and it's just as easy to use. My taxes are relatively simple and I only have a few credits/deductions, but I suspect that even if you do have more complications, it wouldn't matter which program you choose because the questions seemed nearly identical to me.

The only problem I have with TaxCut, which is the main reason that I give the product 4 stars instead of 5, is that I believe they charge too much for the e-filing. (Note that TurboTax charges the same fees, so this also applies to TurboTax.) [...] Federal e-filing (when you do it yourself) is free, and I'm sure that most states have free e-filing as well (my state does). [...] Maybe the IRS charges some fees to these software companies in order to complete the e-file, but if so it can't be that much.

==================

* CD containing Federal and State tax software (you only get One state - you can purchase/download additional States)

* CD containing H&R Deduction Pro software

* mail-in rebate for federal e-filing fee

* mail-in rebate for MS Money purchase

* some other offers from 3rd parties

Installation

============

* I have an older computer but installation was very smooth and without any problems. It didn't even need to reboot.

* Updating with the latest versions of the software and tax codes  from the internet was also smooth. The firewall did pop-up requesting permission for the updater program to use the internet.

Entering and fixing taxes

=========================

* Entering the tax data was relatively straight-forward, although the TaxCut interface still does not have an organic flow and feel to it.

* Their slide-shows with audio commentary highlighting some of the major tax changes and issues was rather informative for those not following the tax code closely

* E-Filing was smooth. Printing the tax returns was also smooth.

==========

* If you have a complicated tax situation, and if you are not familiar with the tax code, this software may not be for you.

* But if you have a relatively straight-forward tax situation, this software gets the job done!",Does a good job if you have a straightforward tax situation

43459,4,H&R Block,60.99,"12 30, 2006","The look and feel of the software is pretty much the same as last year.  However, navigating through the return is a little cumbersome.  They try to dumb down the product so much that the user is pretty much forced to go through the interview screens.  It is a pain to go to specific areas to input or edit because they keep taking you back to the canned interview screens for those sections.  They should give the user the choice of doing a down and dirty input or using their guided entry.  The disk comes with the DeductionPro program which in my opinion is a waste of downloading time.  The only added benefit it provides is giving values for household items donated to charity.  I don't know why TaxCut doesn't just incorporate the ""program"" into the tax return preparation and just make it seamless for the user.

They could also improve on the final error check process.  They show errors and warnings.  When you review a warning, there is no link directly to the fix.  I ended up deleting a form with a warning that I thought was unnecessary and ended up deleting my whole W-2 input which made my whole return wrong.  It took me a while to figure out that I just needed to re-enter the W-2, but after spending hours on my return, that freaked me out a bit.

Last note: you can still e-file with this version, but it costs $15.95 extra and you can add on a state return for $24.95.  If you do need a state return, buying the bundled version will save you money.

TAX LAW UPDATE: As of Feb 3, the IRS will accept returns using the new sales tax deduction and/or the new tuition credit.  I was ultimately very happy with Tax Cut's performance.  The worksheets still print awkwardly and were just a waste of paper, but they did add the option to print the return to review before e-filing which is a must.  I also really like the email notification that your return has been received and then again when it has been accepted along with a link where you can track your refund.

43479,4,H&R Block,65.99,"07 8, 2007","Ive used Turbo Tax until last year. I thought for the price I would take a chance on Tax Cut. It was after all a substantial price difference.

Right away I though the learning curve for TaxCut was a little steeper & it seemed I had to actually do some thinking when it was asking me questions. (Oh Darn!) The phraseology was slightly confusing but not overwhelming.

However, I got through it, the return was correct & it wasn't so difficult that I will go back to TT next year. I think TT is a better product that seems to have been thought out more, but that could be that TT has been around for much longer, I believe. Turbo Tax is far more expensive but I don't think the benefits of TT ( at least in my case ) justify the extra cost.
As far as the e-file, I have never used it & don't really care about that.

43486,4,H&R Block,65.99,"02 9, 2007","I use windows xp.  I've used taxcut for the past 2 years and turbotax prior to that.  My return contains w2s, sched C + 1099s.  I track everything in quicken and with my own excel spreadsheet.  Start to finish my taxes took 30 minutes.  No crashes, no issues.

The things I didn't like were:

* the video about ""whats new for 2006"" took too long to start playing. I don't care about flashy rotating graphics -- just tell me the dope!

* comparing your return to last year's return doesn't sort 1099s by name,  it uses numerical order.  So if you delete 1099 #1 everything is off by 1.

* software update leaves the ""update your software"" window open such that its a little unclear if you need to punch more buttons.  they should either close the window or use a modal dialog.

I don't know whats up with these 2 star reviews, except for the mac folks who may have valid gripes and the guy with the ESPP complaint.  You people who thought e-file was free previously... uh get a clue.  Taxcut was $40 last year to cover it.  Its _never_ been free.

43487,4,H&R Block,65.99,"02 8, 2007","I seldom do reviews but after reading the most recent poor ratings I had to speak up. I've used TaxCut since 1999 except for 2004 when I decided to try Turbo Tax again. (I used Turbo Tax for a few years in the early 1990's then decided to go back to manual mode.)  Turbo Tax also worked fine except I couldn't file electronically. The software refused to work and my DSL connection worked fine for all other Internet activity. So I filed by paper that year and went back to TaxCut for 2005.  I just read someone's review in which they said that TaxCut's tables didn't match the Feds. (and he said he downloaded all the updates.)  Well, I haven't had any such problems with any of my returns and if their software did make a mistake, the person should contact H&R Block. It clearly states that if their software made a calculation mistake they would reimburse you the IRS penalties plus interest.",It works fine.
43488,4,H&R Block,65.99,"01 13, 2007","I'd been using Tax-Cut since 1998 on MAC platforms.  Tax-Cut abandoned MAC users for 2005 taxes, so I was forced to Turbo-Tax.  This was a pain because I had to re-enter information from scratch, as opposed to reading in from the prior year.  I found turbo-tax not any better than Tax-cut in 2005. I have a mix of self employment incomes, some rent etc, requiring lots of forms but I am no business owner.

For 2006, I emailed TaxCut to see if the '06 software could read the MAC '04 resturns.  Answer=NO.  So, I was going to use Turbo-Tax again.  However, Turbo-Tax had done the dirty this year, and divided their premium software by forms (schedule C, then rentals), so I'd have to buy the most expensive ""small business"" Turbo-Tax software, as opposed to just the premium package (even though other reviewers note that its not really for small business).  The price differential of the Schedule C Turbo-Tax, with Tax-Cut is really very large.  On the other hand, returning to the Tax-Cut web-site is omenous in that the ""FAQ"" and software demonstration portions are ""To be developed"".  However, I don't like monopolies, so I decided to give Tax-Cut another try, figuring I can go back  and buy Turbo-Tax if necessary.

I haven't seriously started '06 taxes yet, but I am pleasantly surprised with '06 Tax-cut Premium Federal + State. It looks to be the same as the MAC '04 version.  Better still, it actually read in a bunch of simple '05 Turbo-Tax returns from my minor children.  However, it could not read my '05 Turbo Tax return for some reason (will try some more).  Having not expected to be able to read in any of last years data however, I feel I am at least ahead to some extent.

There are complaints by other purchasers about new e-filing charges for Tax-Cut.  I don't e-file, so I am unaffected.  If the IRS wants a 30-page return with circular nonsensical computations that are so complax that we are forced to buy software and a computer to process it, then they should have the courtesy to read those 30-pages.  You would think we should get a tax-break for e-filing, or the IRS would pay e-filing charges considering the effort it must save.

I've used it before, and although it requires careful use (""Read the lines...."") the end result can be excellent.  Note that the product offers preparation of BOTH the personal (Form 1040 + State) form as well as many business forms.  I use it for my individual return as well as federal and state returns for a Trust.  A prior reviewer is going to have a go at an S-Corporation, and I understand it also will do Partnership returns.

The real reason for this review is the Bundle currently offered (1-14-2007) by Amazon.  Currently it reads, ""Buy this item with H&R Block Taxcut 2006 Premium Federal + State..."" and combines the prices.

As I mentioned in the first paragraph, Taxcut Home and Business does your personal return as well as the business entity.  Moreover, I checked the product description at the H&R Block Taxcut site, and it stipulates ""Includes EVERYTHING from Premium + State + E-file."" (emphasis added)

So the Amazon bundle offer asks you to buy something ALREADY INCLUDED in the product.  By the time you read this review the Bundle offer by Amazon hopefully will have changed.  I've used Amazon for many years, and this is an unusual oversight which I'm certain they will correct.

In the interest of disclosure, I used to work for H&R Block, but not now.  For those who order ANY tax product I offer the following.  IRS has not given final approval for form design changes, so many forms are not available to put on the disc you purchase.  This means you will need to go the H&R Block (or whoever) update site to get the updated forms, and you may have to go back several times.  You have not been singled out for punishment.  This is a process that must be endured by professionals as well as self-preparers.  And I'll say it again... ""Read the lines!""",Caution on the Bundle offered by Amazon

Since many small businesses are S Corps, you probably will need to buy something besides TurboTax...like this program.

That is why I bought this product...I checked the product homepage (taxcut_com) and it said

""Complete Business Coverage - Helps you prepare returns for a number of business types, including Corporations, S Corporations, Partnerships, Limited Liability Companies (LLCs), Non-profits and Estates & Trusts. Plus, the program handles Payroll Taxes as well.""

So hopefully it will work for me without any additional software.  I will try to come back and update this review once I try it out...but since it is from H&R Block, I figure it might not be the simplist program, but at least it will be accurate (they actually guarantees that...although most errors are from the users anyway).

Nice little perk is that the software comes on a USB jumpdrive for easy installation...and it also will import TurboTax files from previous years...

Sorry this review is not more informative, but after spending an hour digging around for S Corp info, I thought it would be helpful to mention that this apparently supports S Corp Businesses, as well as (unlimited) business state returns, personal federal and state as well as E-Filing...

The software package allows you to do your federal and state Corp/Small Bus/S-Corp taxes as well as your personal 1040 federal and State for under $80.00!!  The personal tax program is superior to the business tax process but both are fairly simple as long as you have some knowledge of the process and the information being requested.  Another key perk is the software does interact fairly well with MS Money software so if you have taken the time throughout the year to categorize personal and business expenses it makes for quick dissemination of information.

The reason I call it a little buggy is that every year there is some issue.  The software will not load the updated forms properly or it will hang when opened, etc etc.  This is irritating but the tech support has been outstanding and easily reached. It has been located in the Pacific Northwest (Oregon, I believe) in past years but I cannot attest to whether it is still in the U.S., or outsourced, this year as I have not yet called.

This program is almost as comprehensive as software tax professionals use and is easy enough for just about anyone.  I switched to Tax Cut from Turbo Tax several years ago because it was much cheaper, but now I think the programs are pretty much the same.

First off, the updates take longer than usual, probably the result of Congress taking so long to finalize the tax laws which occurred after the software actually shipped.  So be prepared for 10 minutes of updates before starting your return.

This year Tax Cut makes it much easier to move around the return (income, deductions, etc.) so that you can enter it piecemeal rather than having to go through their interview screens.  It is also much easier to go back to a section if you missed entering something.  You don't have to go through a maze of questions to get to what you need.  BUT when they made it easier to move around, they removed the checkboxes that indicates that you have completed that section.  I entered just a few pieces of information (W-2 and interest) while leaving out major things that I have had on my tax return in prior years (mortgage interest) and did the final check and it did not alert me to missing data.  So, REVIEW YOUR RETURN CAREFULLY to make sure you did not miss anything.

Most companies now issue W-2's which can be imported electronically, but I did not see a way to do that in Tax Cut.  I looked, but didn't see it.  That's a shame.

Tax Cut also improved upon the calculation for the sales tax deduction, but it is still a little confusing for non tax professionals.  They could make it super easy by linking your zip code to a database of tax rates, but I guess a day of programming isn't worth it to them.

The included software Deduction Pro is a decent little program, however they should include a 2008 version so that you can track your contributions all throughout the year.

Tax Cut allows you to e-file, but it will cost you an additional $19.95 to do it.  The Deluxe Turbo Tax with the efile ends up being the same price as Tax Cut if you e-file (assuming Turbo Tax doesn't have hidden charges).

Finally, one nice feature is that Tax Cut allows you to save your return as a PDF so you can uninstall the software and later view your return without having to re-install the software.

I looked at Turbo Tax this year and I actually like the input screens on it much better than Tax Cut this year, mostly because it tracks what areas have been completed and I think their final review is better.

It was very straightforward and efficient.  It came close to what I wanted to accomplish.

But, in the end I needed additional aid with my multiple and rollover Stock transactions.  I was not able to locate my paperwork for these.  Therefor I was in a jam.  I also ended up getting turbotax.

PRO:
1. Good Product.
2. Well Priced.
3. Does what it says.
4. Stable.

Cons:
1.  It is for the experienced user and the one that does not have significant detailed transactions(or for the one who is not organized enough with his papwerwork.)

In particular, the state-level Help is nearly useless - it's sometimes worse than useless.  For example, Virginia has two different ways to deal with long-term care premiums - a credit and a deduction.  The help system only knows about the credit, which I can't use - I had to dig through the raw forms to find the deduction information.  And calling the 800# is no better  - the customer service person assured me it would be corrected in the March update (which doesn't exist, according to the web site), and suggested I buy a new CD with all of the updated forms!

This year I tried it out and was disappointed to see that I could not automatically import W-2 and especially investment bank info (e.g. 1099-INT, 1099-DIV, etc.).  As someone with a busy investment year, this meant a good hour or two of typing just enter my transactions from my brokerage.

I used this product. It is good for someone with Knowledge of the tax code or someone who knows his way around the forms.

I purchased this product for two reasons:
1.  It was less than turbo tax.
2.  I had previously used it.

It was very straightforward and efficient.  It came close to what I wanted to accomplish.

But, in the end I needed additional aid with my multiple and rollover Stock transactions.  I was not able to locate my paperwork for these.  Therefor I was in a jam.  I also ended up getting turbotax.

The Turbo tax is has an automated feature in it that allows you to get the research history and do the computations for all the mulitple entries.

Conclusion:

PRO:
1. Good Product.
2. Well Priced.
3. Does what it says.
4. Stable.

Cons:
1.  It is for the experienced user and the one that does not have significant detailed transactions(or for the one who is not organized enough with his papwerwork.)
2.  Requires deeper understanding of the forms and there True functionalities.
3.  Lacking some additional ""features""/""widgets"" for the normal/inexperienced user.

In particular, the state-level Help is nearly useless - it's sometimes worse than useless.  For example, Virginia has two different ways to deal with long-term care premiums - a credit and a deduction.  The help system only knows about the credit, which I can't use - I had to dig through the raw forms to find the deduction information.  And calling the 800# is no better  - the customer service person assured me it would be corrected in the March update (which doesn't exist, according to the web site), and suggested I buy a new CD with all of the updated forms!

But if you have itemizing, income from more than just employment and a bank account or two, then this is worth the time you'll save.  You can find everything you need to know in the IRS instructions and forms, but the $30-$40 will save you hours of time in looking it up, thru TaxCut's interview process.

A couple of notes, however:

a)  I think that the state tax forms sort of stink -at least for Louisiana.  Instead of outputting the same form that you get from the state (as TaxCut does for the Fed form), it prints out a summarized one, with all the data in one big block, no x-refs, etc.  So you find manually checking it almost impossible.

b) The web-based tools that supposedly are one of the features of TaxCut have never worked for me when I needed them.  Maybe if you wait until March or April to use them, but for those of us that file early, the stuff just hasn't worked.  I rate the web-based and planning tools at a near zero

c) e-mail support hasn't impressed me.  But then, for the filing of your taxes, you really shouldn't need it.  The interview process and built-in help files are generally sufficient.  Still, when I tried to use the web-based features, and they failed to work, I got some ""canned"" responses from the support group that obviously indicated that they 1- did not know what I was talking about, 2-they were using a standard set of FAQs that really didn't answer my questions/concerns, and 3-they really didn't care.  However, as noted, if it works to start with, that's better than problems requiring support, regardless of how good/bad the support is.

d) MOST IMPORTANT-  You MUST keep your software from year to year.  DON'T discard the CD or dnload prior to 5 yr after filing. Reason- except for transferring your personal data as a prelude to entering current year data, you cannot open past year TaxCut tax return files (or at least thru 2006 tax yr) with the current software.  So if you need to make an amended return, or if you're audited for say, a 3 yr old return, you'd better have a printed or PDF copy if you don't still have the sftware.  I think that's pretty poor (not being able to open previous yr's tax return files), but maybe if enough of us complain, a change will occur.  You can, however, output to a PDF and save that file for future ref.  (You won't be able to amend with the PDF however.)

b) The web-based tools that supposedly are one of the features of TaxCut have never worked for me when I needed them.  Maybe if you wait until March or April to use them, but for those of us that file early, the stuff just hasn't worked.  I rate the web-based and planning tools at a near zero

c) e-mail support hasn't impressed me.  But then, for the filing of your taxes, you really shouldn't need it.  The interview process and built-in help files are generally sufficient.  Still, when I tried to use the web-based features, and they failed to work, I got some ""canned"" responses from the support group that obviously indicated that they 1- did not know what I was talking about, 2-they were using a standard set of FAQs that really didn't answer my questions/concerns, and 3-they really didn't care.  However, as noted, if it works to start with, that's better than problems requiring support, regardless of how good/bad the support is.

d) MOST IMPORTANT-  You MUST keep your software from year to year.  DON'T discard the CD or dnload prior to 5 yr after filing. Reason- except for transferring your personal data as a prelude to entering current year data, you cannot open past year TaxCut tax return files (or at least thru 2006 tax yr) with the current software.  So if you need to make an amended return, or if you're audited for say, a 3 yr old return, you'd better have a printed or PDF copy if you don't still have the sftware.  I think that's pretty poor (not being able to open previous yr's tax return files), but maybe if enough of us complain, a change will occur.  You can, however, output to a PDF and save that file for future ref.  (You won't be able to amend with the PDF however.)

But, for under $40, the time saved for anything but a simple return, it's well worth it.  (not to mention the saved time in doing ""what-ifs"" for various filing options.)","Well worth the price if you don't have a ""simple"" return."

In any case Tax Cut does the job for the tax year but the updates are a long chore for low speed connections. Tax Cut (and other software vendors) should adopt a method of only requiring the downloading modules what have changed since the last update.

Also for the 2008 estimated taxes for my state (Georgia), Tax Cut did not update the new, higher level of unearned income deduction for persons over age 62.

43578,4,H&R Block,27.99,"01 3, 2009","TaxCut offers individuals a powerful option for preparing an income tax return that is relatively easy to use. TaxCut assumes that you know little or nothing about income tax law. The software will ask a number of questions and will prompt you for information based on your answers. It will help tremendously if you gather as many of your tax documents as possible before starting. This software is significantly cheaper than paying a service to prepare it and much easier than doing in manually.

The e-file option has been around for some years and is a great way to get your refunds faster. But if you owe money, there's not as much of an advantage.  Still, you get five free electronic filing so you might as well use one.  In the unlikely event that you plan to prepare more than five returns, make sure you use the e-file for the ones due a refund and file the ones with money due manually.  The program will print all the forms you need so it's easy to do and it will save you the cost of the fees for the additional e-files.

One thing to take note of is that this version covers only federal tax returns and does not include a program for state taxes.  If you live in a state with no income tax, this is the version you want.

The pros - the initial interview questions seemed to hit everything needed to get most of the info done before hitting the returns. While answering questions TaxCut offered tips and explainations for everyting. If the explaination didn't show the help or explaination link helped figure things out. Overall the the process was pretty painless and was finished rather quickly.

The cons - You have to know a little about your returns for the error checking part. There might be something that needs verifying or an error to correct. If your not familiar with your returns the area that needs adjusting could be strange or confusing. The other is the begining interview questions. While they are complete if your not use to tax software the order of questions can be confusing. Best advise just stick with it and all will be well.

I bought the product from Amazon for ~$55 and am nearly done with my tax.  I am happy to report that I am rather satisfied with the product!

The CD contains both Taxcut Premier and Taxcut Business. Installation of both on my Window XP computer went smoothly.  Transfer of personal tax data (including rental property information) from Turbotax was quick and completely uneventful.  The Taxcut Premier for personal tax works nearly the same way as Turbotax, and I finished my personal return without any problem.

I did spend (wasted) a lot of time on the business tax return (1120S) and to generate the Schedule K-1. Retrospectively, this is largely because I am preparing a tax return for a S corporation for the first time and had no clue about the basics.  So, I had to spend a lot of time learning the rules by searching the internet.  I do feel that the explanation in Taxcut Business is somewhat inadequate, but I don't know if Turbotax Business is any better in this regard.  I am sure, however, that this will go smoothly next year.

The package includes upto 5 free e-filings for federal returns, and e-filing State return will cost some money (I don't know how much yet).  For the business return (1120S), e-filing is not available.  I have to print and mail it. Since there is no real tax involved, I don't mind doing that.

In 2008, TaxCut had many business forms, such as 1041 for trusts and 990 for nonprofits.  It did not have a lot of math in it, so the user had to do calculations and be sure the numbers flowed to the appropriate spaces.  In 2014, there are better options for your business taxes.

The Home program is fine for home use, but even here you have to know what you are doing.

I use the program for my own taxes, which include or have included dual states, Schedule C, dividends, interest, capital gains, W-2, K-1, 1099, itemized deductions, home-buyer's credit.

Except for very complicated K-1s and lump-sum pensions, I've never encountered a training exercise that HRB couldn't solve correctly.

You cannot load two TaxCuts on the same computer.  So you have a choice if you need more than one state.  You can download extra states at very high prices for your single computer.  Or you can load two programs on two computers, getting a free state with each.  The latter option is tedious, and unlikely to be a net money saver.

You cannot e-file state taxes for free.  You have to either pay a reasonable surcharge for this privilege, or mail your state taxes.  Since I don't loan money to my tax collectors, I'm fine with free e-filing for my federal while making my state payments by certified USPS.",Good in 2008

Maybe I'm just used to this software, but I find it easier to switch back and forth between forms, and generally easier to use.  There is no state income tax where I live, so this version fits my needs perfectly.","Basic, but it does the job"
43608,4,H&R Block,32.49,"01 3, 2009","TaxCut offers individuals a powerful option for preparing an income tax return that is relatively easy to use. TaxCut assumes that you know little or nothing about income tax law. The software will ask a number of questions and will prompt you for information based on your answers. It will help tremendously if you gather as many of your tax documents as possible before starting. This software is significantly cheaper than paying a service to prepare it and much easier than doing in manually.

The e-file option has been around for some years and is a great way to get your refunds faster. But if you owe money, there's not as much of an advantage.  Still, you get five free electronic filing so you might as well use one.  In the unlikely event that you plan to prepare more than five returns, make sure you use the e-file for the ones due a refund and file the ones with money due manually.  The program will print all the forms you need so it's easy to do and it will save you the cost of the fees for the additional e-files.

There are a couple of issues to take note of if you buy this version of TaxCut.  First, this version covers only federal tax returns and does not include a program for state taxes.  If you live in a state with no income tax, this is the version you want.  But if you do need to file with your state, you'll want to buy the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/H-R-Block-TaxCut-2008-Premium-Federal-State-e-file/dp/B001HOD50K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">H&R Block TaxCut 2008 Premium Federal + State + e-file</a>&nbsp;version.

These probably won't be needed by everyone, but take a good look at the chart in the product description area to see if you will miss the features or not.

If you don't itemize your deductions and have a very simple return, you might be better off preparing the forms manually on your own. On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you have a return with major league complications, you should probably go to a good CPA. For everyone else, this is really a no-brainer. It's inexpensive, easy to use, and accurate. I've been using TaxCut for quite a few years and would not even consider giving it up.","Excellent tax tool, but this version is limited"

43613,4,H&R Block,26.99,"12 7, 2008","I also switched to Taxcut this year after many years of preparing my return with Turbotax.  To me, it's essentially the same. Taxcut imported last year's turbotax data which helps by pre-filling in a lot of forms.  You go through a very similar interview process.  You can go to the actual forms and tweak the numbers.

Some things which are different:
1. taxcut auto saves every few minutes.. so if you are experimenting, you ought to make a copy first and mess with that, otherwise you might find the changes have been written to disk without explicitly saving them.
2. Schedule C does not allow joint spouse ownership as is available in turbotax.  Turbotax would autmatically split all the income, expenses, taxes for SE, etc into two sets for you.  Tax cut says you have to do this by yourself manually. (which defeats the purpose of using software)
3. If you go to the actual form for Schedule C and double click in the box to toggle Y/N for passive activity, the program consistently crashes.. thank goodness for that frequent auto-save.  I don't know where to report this to H&R block since their customer service doesn't have an email address. You can change the value of this box through the interview, however.
4. You can only add up to 6 items per field (via the itemized list) where as in turbotax I never encountered a limit.

In conclusion, despite some minor problems which I hope will be fixed in an update, Taxcut seems to be an adequate replacement for turbotax if you want to make a statement to protest Intuit and yet still get your taxes done.","Switched from Turbotax, seems comparable."

Hope they change that or I will look for different software.,No state E file
43615,4,H&R Block,26.99,"12 7, 2008","UPDATE 1/24/09:

I am still very satisfied with this product.  So far I've entered all my data, and it's been pretty painless, both for Fed & State taxes.

I have to qualify this by saying that my taxes are pretty simple this year, with no AMT, no sch C, no sch K, etc.  So I'm not really running into some areas that are often not handled well in tax software.

One thing I liked better than turbo tax was the simpler handling of tax-exempt income, splitting the in-state vs. out-of-state portions.  Also, similarly, the handling of US Treasury interest (tax-exempt for state tax).  Turbo Tax makes you enter separate 1099s for each part, instead of just capturing the information within one form dialog.

On the other side, I have some additional critiques:
(1) no ability to import/download W2 & 1099 data (not that I found, anyway)
(2) form 1116 has to be filled out manually, even if it's pretty straightforward -- they could have and should have provided an interview for this
(3) no way provided to simply delete a line in a form (minor point, turbo tax has this, and I find it very useful) -- you can of course delete the data in the line

INITIAL REPORT:

Obviously, it's a bit too early to provide a thorough review of the program, because it's essentially incomplete (as is TurboTax): many tax forms are still not available in their final form.  There will be a Dec 11 update, and I expect several others over the next couple of months.  (I've learned from past experience not to submit final returns until late March, since the bug fixes and form corrections are often not final until then.  This is True for either TurboTax or TaxCut.)

However, here's my current take: this is a fine program, and certainly more than adequate for the necessary help preparing a tax return.  I've used TaxCut in the past, but have used TurboTax for the past few years.  I decided to use TaxCut this year because of the price difference, and because the new licensing policy for TT is annoying.  So far I'm finding it easy to use, and trouble-free in importing data from the previous year TurboTax file and current year TXF files.

One minor weakness compared to TurboTax: I remember that in the 07 TT you could remove a specific set of imported data; I haven't found anything like that in this program.  Not a biggie for me, since I always save ""checkpoints"" in separate files so I can revert to a previous version if I need to, but it's the kind of little thing that makes TT a bit better in my opinion. Just not sufficiently better that I will pay anything Intuit wants to charge (just a matter of principle for me).

Some general comments, based on experience over many years of doing my own (often very complicated) returns:  Neither program is perfect by any means.  For many complicated situations you have to do your own calculations externally (I use Excel), or enter data manually.  Be aware that dealing with AMT, AMT credits, and stuff like that remains mind-bendingly difficult, just not as nightmarish as doing them without a program to help.  And you should always sanity check your results, because odd calculation bugs can persist for a long time.  (I found a very stupid, but hard to find, calculation bug in TurboTax a few years ago, having to do with AMT.)

I will post an update in a few weeks when I've had the chance to make more progress with my return.  Will be able to review the state program as well at that point, perhaps.","good tax program, meets the needs so far"
43616,4,H&R Block,26.99,"12 4, 2008",Love this software. Makes doing your taxes easy and is much less fuss than an accountant with just as much accuracy.,Idunno depends on how much tax i have to pay
43617,4,H&R Block,26.99,"12 1, 2008","I switched from TurboTax to TaxCut this year primarily due to Intuit's new pricing structure where they both raised the base price quite a bit and then they charge $9.95 for each additional return you want to prepare beyond the first one.  Given those changes, it was time to try something else.

So far I am very pleased with TaxCut.  It imported my TurboTax data from last year without any problems at all.  It also will import data from Quicken, though I don't use that option.

It is a different interface and takes a little getting used to, but then TurboTax's interface changes every year also so with either product one is going to have to adjust to some new interface quirks.

Of course, it is pretty early to be running software, since the IRS is still finalizing things for 2008, and such things as the Alternative Minimum Tax haven't been nailed down, but TaxCut still did a very good job helping me see where I was going to come out on my taxes for 2008.  And that includes my schedule C for a consulting business.  Obviously, there will be a bunch of updates in a few weeks, but that is to be expected from any Tax Software at this stage.

TaxCut also did a nice job helping me plan for 2009 taxes as well.  I had already done some planning using a Numbers Spreadsheet on the Macintosh and so I could tell whether TaxCut was pretty accurate.  It was.

Overall, for those who are thinking about switching to TaxCut this year from TurboTax, my take is that I found it easy to do.","New to TaxCut, Pleased with it So Far"

I searched the HR Block web site and could not find a single reference as to how you can even do a state e-file, let alone what the cost is.  This is pure moral evil.

HR Block (and Turbo Tax did the same this year) are like the banks which astronomically jack up your rates if you are 3 days late on a credit card payment.

This is a way to increase the actual price paid to HR Block while decreasing the initial sale price to the customer and decreasing the total revenue to the sellers of the product like Amazon.  Of course, when you get ready to e-file the state return be prepared to pay a jacked up non competitive fee to do it.

43649,4,H&R Block,26.99,"03 29, 2009","I've used H&R Block's TaxCut program for Windows, each year for the past 5 years (or more).  I've also run both TurboTax and TaxCut during a few years to see if the ""help"" was better in one or the other (when I was trying to figure out how to answer a question).  Plugging numbers into these programs is not hard.  Determining what numbers to plug in can still be hard.

My experience is that the built-in help behind the questions for the Federal forms is usually OK.  In the unusual areas, I am surprised at how weak the help is - it's there, but not deep.  However, the help behind the State forms is not good - it's shallow at best.

The math in these programs is always right (usually... I did find a bug one year that they quickly fixed in an update), but again, the burden is on you the user to determine what numbers to plug in or when to say ""yes"" or ""no"" during the online interview that these take you through.  In many cases, it's not hard.  But in those hard(er) areas, it can take hours researching what is really being asked.  I've found myself downloading IRS forms and instructions most years to figure out at least one question, and I would not say that my tax returns are all that complicated (I don't have a lot of the odd situations to report).

Getting 5 Federal filings with the price of the full package this year was nice, but paying $19.99 to efile a State Form still feels ridiculously too much.  And in some cases, the Forms needed to file an odd-Sate return need to be paper (they aren't all included with TaxCut), so efile does not work in those situations.  I file 3 sets of forms each year (mine and for 2 of my kids) and this year, the cost or complexities with the kids' State forms will mean paper filing for both of their State returns.

I have not contacted H&R Block for help, so I can't comment on the waiting times to get that help or on the depth of help provided over the phone or over chat (however they do it).

But all of this is still a lot easier (and fun? at least it's a challenge to overcome) for the do-it-yourself type person, than the old paper forms or in taking all the papers to their office and paying them to do it (my opinion).","Fed OK, State (WI) is shallow"

also id like to add. ive looked at this at several different places and they are charging outrageous  prices for this..ive seen this same version  at best buy,target, and walmart for 60.00 plus...its insane to pay that much for software that you will have to either update  or even get again the following year.

save some cash and get it on amazon!",Grab this One Here on Amazon !
43659,4,H&R Block,26.99,"03 13, 2009","Back when I did my 2005 taxes, I swore I would never go back to TaxCut.  I had a harrowing experience with the program including software bugs and crashes, inadequate interface, missing schedules, and a nightmare with deduction pro.  To top it all off customer support was virtually non-existant.  When I did get through they were unable to help me.

When I received a free copy of TaxCut 2008 Premium Federal in the mail with 'Free! We want you back"" blazoned on the CD jacket, I was leary but then thought, 'what the heck. It's free, I'll try it.'

PROS:
1. Competent tax programt that has come a long way--now comparable with
TurboTax (in the past this was not the case)
2. Reasonable interface
3. Reasonably priced
4. Federal forms worked smoothly
5. INCREDIBLE customer support via webchat; BETTER than TurboTax
6. Much improved DeductionPro
7. Easy e-file

CONS:
1. I think TurboTax still has the edge...
2 Poor integration with state forms
3. So-so interview for state forms
4. Poor help files for state forms
5. DeductionPro not as easy to use for non-monetary donations/deductions as TurboTax's It'sDeductable
6. Key codes needed for e-filing weren't included in my version.  They were easy to obtain from customer support, but this was an unnecessary annoyance.

So try it, I did and I was pleasantly surprised. I am comparing this to last year's experience with TurboTax, as I was satisfied with TaxCut and went with it.  On the whole, the Federal tax experience is excellent, however, the state tax experience was less smooth.  (See below)

Bear in mind that I do not have an overly difficult return to file.  No major investments and not very complicated itemized deductions.  I did move this year so I had two state forms to fill out and did sell and buy a house.  Other than this, pretty simple and standard.  I completed the taxes on an iMac, so this may be somewhat different than the Windows version.

THE INTERFACE:  For starters, my TurboTax information from last year imported with out a hitch.  The questions were simple and to the point. There are fewer fill-ins per screen than in last year's TaxCut.  My guess is that it took a little longer than last year, but that may have had to do with the increased complexity of my taxes.  One caveat here is that you have to answer the questions carefully, as missing one will result in missing one part of your tax.  In comparison with TurboTax, TaxCut's interview questions are a little less clear.  Double checking and knowing your finances does solve most problems, but care must be taken to make sure you don't miss a schedule or a life event.  On the whole this was easy, but I'd give a slight edge to TurboTax here.

On the whole, the feature sets are similar between programs.  I would have to say, that TurboTax is somewhat slicker.  TurboTax allows you to download some W-2s electronically--I did not see that option in TaxCut.  TurboTax has better integration between help files and the interview and also allows for easier navigation between sections on the tax forms.  But TaxCut is no slouch and was adequate to the task.

DEDUCTION PRO:  This is gobs better than TaxCut 2005.  I like the fact that the program is installed on your computer, making it more responsive than the TurboTax equivalent.  (It'sDeductable!, from TurboTax, is an online program.)  It was easy to input various charities and non-monetary donations.  DeductionPro has a 'calculator' for non-monetary donations, but once you calculate the value you have to manually input it into DeductionPro.  The TurboTax version allows you to calculate the value and then directly inputs it into the spreadsheet--a much smoother operation.  Unlike my past experience with DeductionPro, the deductions were quickly and easily imported into TaxCut.  If you revise your deductions and reimport the file, TaxCut now has a failsafe to prevent you from deducting the same things twice.  Much better than 2005.  If you have a lot of non-monetary deductions, TurboTax would win the competition.  If you have mostly monetary deductions, TaxCut's interface is better and, given that the program runs on your computer, there is no need for passwords and no time lags that can happen on web-based programs.

FINAL AUDIT:  Both programs seem to have reasonable audit features and bring you to the area of the forms where there are questions or problems.  No difference here.

E-FILING: There are 5 free e-files on TaxCut and the process went without a hitch.  Both programs work well in this respect

CUSTOMER SUPPORT/PROBLEMS:  I had to contact customer support 3 times with TaxCut.  Each time, I used their webchat interface.  My longest wait for an customer service rep was 10 minutes.  Each time, the customer service rep was courteous, helpful, and solved my problem.  This is MUCH MUCH BETTER than what occurred in 2005 when customer service was virtually non-existant and unable to help.

Problems included:
1. The need for a Key Code in order to e-file.  Key codes were not included with my program (unclear why).  I needed a keycode for both the federal form and the state forms.  These were supplied by the customer service rep.
2. Inability to remove an inappropriate schedule from a state form.  I was walked through this with a service rep
3. The CD I received did not have DeductionPro bundled with it.  Customer service gave me a download link for the program.  (This may be a glitch in the Apple/OSX version of the program)

Each time help came quickly and easily.  TaxCut gets 5 stars for live 24 hour help.  Last year's TurboTax help was okay, but nothing to write home about...

STATE FORMS:  This is where TaxCut takes a bit of a dive.  Based on my experience with the Federal forms, I bought and downloaded the state forms.  All I needed were the key codes (as noted above) which were absent after the download.  These weren't sent via email, but I knew about this when I requested the codes for the federal forms and received the key codes for the state at the same time.

The state forms are less well integrated with the federal forms than I remember from TurboTax.  I never had to complete two forms with TurboTax.  Suffice it to say, the NJ form was easier than the PA form (which is strange because PA is a flat percentage of your income).  The state forms did not integrate with each other at all.

The PA and NJ forms did import information from the federal forms and W-2s, but did not take the information about my move from the beginning of the TaxCut interview.  I had to input this information into the state forms and actually had to do this separately for each state as the state forms do not integrate with each other.  The same was True for salary collected from one state while my primary residence was in the other.  I had to input redundant information into the program.  It's hard for me to compare this with TurboTax as I had only used TurboTax with a single state before.

The state forms did not have thorough interviews.  Some information had to be typed directly into the forms themselves.  Not specifically a problem, but in the tax software business, the interface is the most important thing.

Finally, the state help files were not as thorough.  Especially for PA, I found myself downloading files from the PA state site in order to review instructions for filling out the tax forms--a major glitch in the TurboTax state forms.

One major problem:  the PA form imported the sale of my home from the federal taxes.  The problem is, sale of a primary residence is not taxable in PA unless some part of the home is used for commercial purposes (or a few other exceptions).  After researching the instructions and downloading PDFs of the PA forms from PA state, I realized that this was the case.  Needless to say, TaxCut calculated a massive underpayment and I was unable to delete scheudule D without consulting customer service.  (As it turns out, I had to delete the schedule D 'worksheet' and then delete the forms.  If you try to delete the forms themselves, nothing happens...)

SUMMARY:  On the whole, I was pleasantly surprised with TaxCut.  Would I use it again?  I suppose I would.  TaxCut was a bit more rough around the edges to use than TurboTax, but beat TurboTax hands down with their customer support.  I would say that these programs are both good ways to do taxes.

On the whole, however, I was pleasantly surprised by TaxCut this year.  Would I have used it if I hadn't received the federal form free? Probably not.  But I will have to think about whether I will stick with TaxCut next year and the program was good enough to get me thinking.","A solid program to do taxes.  Fine federal, weak state tax program"

This year however, we had a new twist.  We elected to complete tax returns for our children individually instead of reporting them on our return.  We'd never dealt with the ""Kiddie Tax"" and there was some phraseology in the TaxCut software that didn't make any sense (wanted the collective dividend income for all the other children, but didn't tell us where to find it...almost a circular argument).  We were stuck and needed an answer about how THEIR SOFTWARE worked (not a tax question), but conveniently the only way that they'll answer a question is if you pay to speak to one of their tax advisers!

43664,4,H&R Block,26.99,"03 2, 2009","After using TurboTax for the past 7-8 years, I decided to turn to something else as I was sick of the ever-increasing price. As far as the product quality goes, I found TaxCut as goog as its TurboTax counterpart. User interface is virtually the same. The only inconvenience I found is that TaxCut does not allow you to directly import your W-2 data from the ADP web site.

Beware of the price fluctuation! The prices of both TurboTax and TaxCut fluctuate at Amazon all the time! At the time I ordered my copy of TaxCut, the price was $34.99. About a week later, the price of the same product (Yes, not the download version or any other variations but this exact box version of Premium Fed + State + e-file) jumped up to $46.99 if I remember the price correctly. Now it is again down to $36.99 as of this writing (3/2/09). I wouldn't be surprised if the price was listed differently when you read my review.

My two cents about the rating - you will never see 4 or 5 stars average for a product like this that is widely exposed to a huge public. More and more people start complaining as the product's popularity grows. Both TurboTax and TaxCut are decent, it's just that no tax software lets you get the maximum benefit possible while you have a donkey's brain.","As good as TurboTax, beware of price fluctuation!"

Includes extra tools like a calculator. I used the included DeductionPro but since I'd already figured most of that, I really didn't use all its features, but it looks very good. Only one small beef in TaxCut--an itemized list feature doesn't seem to work properly, but there was an easy workaround. I've used it to prepare and efile for several family members and will finish mine as soon as I get the last info from a brokerage, so the 5 free federal efiles are very nice. Just wish the state efiles were free too. My kids decided the $19.95 was too steep and printed/mailed theirs.

I've had training on H&R Block's software they use in their storefronts, on AARP's software used in their Tax-Aide program, and used TurboTax for 3 years. I can honestly say TaxCut is easier, more intuitive, has great help features, and is at the top of the pack. The inclusion of 5 free federal efiles is a real bonus. Now, if we can only get state efiles too, I'd give it a 5 star rating!!

For the rest of us, TaxCut is easier to navigate, less prone to omission, and has been cheaper if you include one state return.  On the other hand, it pays to check any obscure form that results because I have twice found errors, both slightly additive to taxes and neither worth the effort or expense of using other software or paying someone else.  If you don't understand whether something should be added or subtracted, figure it out.

Two negatives:
1. TaxCut navigation gets worse every year.  It used to be possible to go directly to a category like capital gains or rental income.  Now you have to slosh through a series of Next buttons to get to anything.

Hopefully this information garnered from taxcut.com will help others in similar situations out: the key is that one will need to file as unmarried individuals on the federal (and can efile) but state taxes will need to be mailed in; since the program uses your federal filing status (married/unmarried) to do the state taxes, one needs to rerun the program with a mock federal filing in the program (without actually submitting the federal form) to then be able to get the corrected married-couple settings for the state filing section.

Issue: Filing a joint federal return with a same-sex partner

For federal tax purposes, a marriage is a legal union only between a man and a woman as husband and wife. This means you can't file a joint federal return with a partner of the same sex. However, some states allow joint filing for registered domestic partnerships, civil unions, or same-sex marriages. These states include:

  * California
  * Connecticut
  * District of Columbia
  * New Hampshire
  * Massachusetts
  * New Jersey
  * Vermont

You can file joint state returns with TaxCut for domestic partnerships, same-sex marriages, and civil unions by following these steps:

1. To meet your federal tax obligation, each party must complete a federal tax return using one of the following filing statuses:
  * Single
  * Head of Household
  * Qualifying Widow(er)
You cannot file a federal return using the Married Filing Jointly or Married Filing Separately status.

2. For your state return, you must decide whether you want to file Married Filing Jointly or Married Filing Separately. In most cases, filing jointly works to your advantage.

3. Complete another federal return with a filing status of either Married Filing jointly or Married Filing Separately to use as a base for your state return. Do not file this return.
Note: The filing status you use should correspond to the filing status you want to use for your state return.

4. Complete your state return.

5. You must file a paper return and mail it. We'll include mailing instructions when you complete your return.

I made that mistake several years ago with Turbo Tax not knowing if an update was planned.  Turbo Tax may have a notification process by now, I haven't tried them since.  The two programs work essentially the same using an interview process, or you can go directly to the forms if you are competent.  There is one important difference.  Tax Cut costs less.

I was able to install the program and download and install the updates with no problems.

I had some trouble importing my very complex personal/business return and had to call customer support. The call was answered with only a short wait for a human. While the tech support person knew the program, he was not conversant with specific tax-related aspects of the program that I suspected might be at the heart of the problem. (I have pages and pages of fully depreciated items from years of being in business.) Finally, after trying a couple of things, I was told to reinstall the program from the CD -- and after doing that, the old return prepared in TurboTax loaded with no problems.

I suspect the people with these negative reviews have short memories.

I find it useful that information transfers from year to year with minimal changes.  The interface is pretty good - not perfect - I find that little changes from year to year, which makes me wonder why I can't pay an upgrade charge rather than buying a new product each year.

Otherwise, no big complaints here - software works for me and is cheaper than going to an accountant.  Plus, I can take my time and complete the paperwork over a week-or-so rather than trying to pull everything together at once.

43704,4,H&R Block,26.99,"01 3, 2009","TaxCut offers individuals a powerful option for preparing an income tax return that is relatively easy to use. TaxCut assumes that you know little or nothing about income tax law. The software will ask a number of questions and will prompt you for information based on your answers. It will help tremendously if you gather as many of your tax documents as possible before starting. This software is significantly cheaper than paying a service to prepare it and much easier than doing in manually.

The e-file option has been around for some years and is a great way to get your refunds faster. But if you owe money, there's not as much of an advantage.  Still, you get five free electronic filing so you might as well use one.  In the unlikely event that you plan to prepare more than five returns, make sure you use the e-file for the ones due a refund and file the ones with money due manually.  The program will print all the forms you need so it's easy to do and it will save you the cost of the fees for the additional e-files.

The one negative for this program is that the publisher used to offer free e-filing for the state return as well as federal but has dropped that for the 2008 edition.  With a charge weighing in a whopping $19.95 for e-filing each state return, this is not a trivial fee.  I would recommend filing state returns manually unless you will receive a refund large enough to make getting the check a week or so faster worth that extra money.

Please note that this version covers both Federal and State returns.

But Intuit's scammy behavior was too offensive for me to remain a customer.

The good news is that Taxcut works just fine, importing my TurboTax files and providing a clean, easy interview interface (TurboTax's has gotten too complex, so I switched to using the forms mode instead a couple years back). The forms are fine, too, though I do wish you could have the forms and interview running in parallel in Taxcut as you can in TurboTax -- that's helpful during final review.

43730,4,H&R Block,106.4,"02 12, 2010","We have used H&R Block Tax Cut to prepare federal and state taxes for just about as long as we have had a home computer.  Many years ago we filled out our federal, state and city income tax forms manually.  Hopefully, we never need to do that again.

We now live in a state with an income tax that only applies to a small portion of the population.  Due to the price difference, we sought out a copy of H&R Block At Home that omitted the state filing capability.  This version did not seem to be available from any national chains with ""brick and mortar"" stores in our area.

We ordered H&R Block At Home Deluxe (less state) from Amazon.  I was very pleased with how quickly it arrived, a couple days before the estimated delivery date.

Due to the recession several changes were made to the federal income taxes for 2009 as part of the economic stimulus.  Without H&R Block At Home I might have overlooked some of these.  There was an $800 per couple ""Making Work Pay Credit"" that I completely forgot about.  We were also able to deduct sales tax on a new vehicle even though we didn't itemize deductions.  In addition, a portion of my unemployment compensation was not taxable.  The software ferreted out all of these things which more than paid for itself.",A repeat H&R Block user

I just installed today onto a Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit system, no errors at all.  Using an administrator account, I clicked ""Install"" once my DVD-drive recognized the CD, and took all of the defaults through the installation.  By default, it installed into the ""C:\Program Files (x86)\HRBlock2009"" directory which I believe indicates it's run in a compatibility mode.

It all worked fine.  Once the program started, I clicked ""Register Later"" to postpone until all updates were added, then the program immediately fetched a rather large set of updates.  It shut itself down, installed the updates, and restarted, again all error-free.  Then I registered, imported my 2008 tax data and proceeded to run through an initial interview.

I've ran through a fair number of the screens, those typical for a Deluxe user, and I've found no problems.  Everything works fine, pop-ups, Whole Form views, search, additional worksheets, custom form edits, help windows -- I haven't found any compatibility issues, but again, I've yet to complete (and I haven't printed or ran eFile).

43733,4,H&R Block,106.4,"02 1, 2010","I have used H&R Block's TaxCut program (predecessor to H&R Block at Home) for several years and have been very pleased - it does a good job, and is easy to navigate.

This year I ordered H&R Block at Home that was clearly labeled as being a CD, requiring a CD-ROM drive; that is exactly what I have - a CD drive, but not a DVD drive.  When it arrived, I put the CD (or what looked like a CD) in the drive, but it did not open, even though the drive acted like it was opening the program.  When I checked the properties (by right-clicking the drive), it showed that the CD was completely full, meaning that the CD had been ""burned"" as having a program but contained ""0 bytes.""  A tech guru also tried it, with the same result; then he put it in a laptop's DVD drive, opened it and copied the program to a flash drive, then installed that on my computer.

So, even though Amazon's info listed the program as being a CD, and even though the printed box that the program came in also listed the program as being a CD, it was actually a DVD and had been ""burned"" as a DVD.  Those people who have a DVD drive on their computer might not ever notice the difference, but for those of us who have only a CD drive, it is a critical difference.  The fault here is not with Amazon; instead the fault is with whoever actually ""burned"" the CD's for H&R Block.

As for the program that the guru got installed on my computer, it worked great; I e-filed my tax return yesterday with no apparent problems!","Great product, but . . ."

43735,4,H&R Block,99.8,"01 22, 2010","I'm a long time user of this product but I'm disappointed with this version.  Immediately on install from CD I got a warning of the Artemis! virus.  It completed install even though it complained about missing a temporary file in c:\config.msi folder.  It seems to work ok but it will not update the Federal forms at all.  Right when the update is about to complete (4 seconds remaining) it stops and reverses the installation of the update.  No errors, no reasons.  I called H&R Block help line and of course with no errors, no help.  Unfortunately, the software is no good if the forms can't be updated.  If it matters I'm using 64-bit version of Windows 7.  I uninstalled/reinstalled a couple of times and same problem.  I even downloaded the update file directly from the H&R Block website, again same problem.  My only option is to return it for a refund.  I have to give them 1 star.

01/29/2010  UPDATE
I finally figured a workaround for my problem. I use McAfee VirusScan Enterprise and I set the following options in their On-Access Scan Properties window:
1) uncheck Enable on-access scanning at system startup (on the General tab window)
2) I set the Heuristic network check for suspicious files Sensitivity Level to Diable (on the General tab window)
3) uncheck Enable scanning of scripts (on the ScriptScan tab window)
4) rebooted my pc
5) since I got H&R Blook At Home Premium to load in Windows XP, I ran the install program from the CD in Windows XP SP3 compatibility mode and also selected to Run as Administrator
6) H&R Block at Home Premium installed without problems and I was able to update the forms
7) I reset my VirusScan settings back to their defaults and rebooted

Note: You may want to check out the comment on the 1 star rating (dated 01/19/2010).  That commenter may have suggested an easier solution.  I missed that comment last time I was up here.

It was cheaper and frankly I thought it a bit easier to use (in comparison with prior years of TT).  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is, much like prior versions of Turbo Tax, the information for the State Form wasn't as helpful/detailed.  I can understand why that might be, but for the non-accountant a little more guidance there would be nice, especially because I find our state's form to be a little less clear than federal forms so if anything more help is needed there.  I move through everything fairly quickly which is nice.  And unlike previous versions of TT I don't have to pay extra for audit support.

43742,4,H&R Block,99.8,"03 29, 2010","This year I switched to this software and liked some things better than TurboTax, but also had some issues with it.  I've used TurboTax for years and like other users, was not happy when I started having to buy the much more expensive version in order to include my home business information, but would have used it again anyway until I read early TT reviews complaining of the software causing PC crashes.  I wasn't up for that so I decided to go with H&R Block software for the first time.

Pros:
- The product loaded smoothly on my older XP PC and downloaded the updates without incident.  It operated cleanly throughout as well.
- It imported my info from last year's TurboTax file with no problem.
- The interface seemed more clear, direct and easy to understand.
At first I struggled a little because it was unfamiliar and seemed too easy, as though something was being left out, but I gained confidence as I continued and ultimately liked this interface much better.
- This product (that includes Home Business) is much cheaper than the comparable TT.
- The Home Business portion was much better than TurboTax where I've had to search for it in the past and didn't find I had enough direction about what to enter where.
- I found it much easier to return to areas I questioned to recheck or change things.
- The `Guide Me' areas and Help screens were clear and easy to navigate and return from.

Cons:
- I remember the software saying I could pay by AmEx after my e-file return was accepted, but when I went to the 3rd party website, that wasn't available.
- I made a huge error on one of my deductions, which was not flagged by the software.  Luckily when I compared my return to others in the same income range at the end, it looked odd to me so I went back to re-read the instructions, and sure enough where I thought I was supposed to enter sales taxable amount (expecting the software to calculate the tax considering it knew my state), I should have entered just the tax.  Made a big difference, sadly.  I would have expected the software to question it, given the information available, and alert me.  I'm glad I caught it before filing.
- I entered donations made on two different dates into Deduction Pro, but only one imported.  I tried again, but ultimately had to enter the amount of the second manually.
- One of the work sheets I would like to have seen wasn't part of the full print package.

Even if the software had been perfect, I could never get 5-star excited about doing taxes. In the end, using this software was somewhat less painful than using TurboTax in the past, and certainly less painful than doing the taxes manually.

This is with my HP laptop w/ Vista Home Premium, Intel T7500 processor and 2 GB RAM and a wireless connection to my home DSL network.

The basic package is enough for most people, but it's a little disappointing that they no longer include the DeductionPro software.  I really didn't have any non-cash contributions to figure out, though, so I didn't need it this year.  (We've donated some items, but I'm not good about keeping receipts for those king of donations, so I don't usually worry about them at tax time.)

If you want Deluxe, though, here's a tip.  I bought Basic from Amazon for $14.99 and one of the first things it did after installation was offer me the opportunity to upgrade (via download) to Deluxe for $10 or Premium for $40.  So you may come out cheaper getting Deluxe this way.  The upgrade is probably worth it, if you have a significant amount of non-cash charitable donations.

But, as I said, it handles pretty well all of my needs for regular income, interest, investment brokerage account, IRA/401K, Dependant Care FSA, itemized deductions (state/property taxes, mortgage interest, charitable deductions).  I had all my paperwork and receipts in order, and it took me less than two hours to complete everything, review the final numbers and e-file.

All-in-all, it did what I needed and was very user friendly.  If they hadn't taken DeductionPro out of the basic package, I'd give it five stars.

H&R Block came in 3-4 days; loaded easily and seemed a lot more user friendly.  I have 13 interest and dividend entries to make plus two pensions.  Found that I had $13,800 deductions but not enough to defeat the standard deduction of $14,600. (No wonder the USA is going broke).

I am 84 and the wife 83 and our income is pensions, social security, and investment income including two tax exempt funds totaling $9315 which TURBO TAX could never seem to include on line 8b and had to be manually overwritten.

My only objection was that H&R Block did not do the Illinois State Return correctly and had to be overwritten.  Illinois does not tax IRA income, Pension Income and Social Security income and seemed to not be able to excluded these from the taxable income.  I ended up completing the Illinois form manually. H&R Block does not tell you anywhere how to manually overwrite and I had to discover that myself.

I printed both the Federal and Illinois returns and mailed them to the IRS.  H&R Block told me that I had a refund of $529 and $140.  I send in quarterly installments so a lot of guess work is involved.  I don't trust E-Filing so never use it.  Illinois is dead broke and I waited 8 months to get a refund of $194.50 for 2008.

Beware, if you have to amend your tax form, you must ensure that you have downloaded the latest changes from H & R Block.

43832,4,H&R Block,106.4,"02 12, 2010","I've used TurboTax for more than a decade.  I finally tried H&R Block.  Here's what I found:

--- HOW IT'S LIKE TURBOTAX:

It imports my 2008 TurboTax data just fine.

The interview process is pretty much the same as TurboTax:  You go through a bunch of pages of questions.  There are often hints such as ""not common"" to steer you away from unlikely checkboxes that sound tempting.  There are links to relevant frequently asked questions along the side.  You can easily view the corresponding tax form (or fill out the corresponding form directly) from any interview page.

The e-filing system is the same.  You get 5 free federal e-files.  You have to pay $20 for each state e-file.  I always e-file the federal and mail in the state.

After you complete the federal questionnaire, you select which state you'd like to download (1 comes free with this product).

--- HOW IT'S INFERIOR TO TURBOTAX:

Maybe it was just me, but I got completely confused about how to include the 1099-G for last year's state refund.  I ended up entering it manually through the forms.

When I printed my state forms (New York), the instructions told me I had to attach a copy of my Schedule C from the federal return.  (TurboTax just includes it automatically.)  This is silly, and an opportunity to make a mistake.

There is no equivalent to TurboTax's ""supporting details"" feature where you could press Ctrl-I on any field and fill out a little spreadsheet to show how you got your number.  I always used to do that for my property taxes to show school tax plus county tax.  If you want to keep a record of how you justify an entry, you'll need to do it somewhere else.

-- CONCLUSION:

H&R Block is pretty much the same as TurboTax, but without quite the same polish.  Both programs feel very similar to use and they can import each other's previous-year tax files, so it's easy to switch back and forth from year to year.

I had to prepare two fairly complex returns that included stock sales, pension annuity, IRA withdrawals, additional employment income, and all the usual deductions (taxes, mortgage interest, medical, etc.). The federal and state versions worked perfectly. The interface is different than Turbo Tax, but works more efficiently than TT. The key to using this program is running through the interview process and then going to the individual forms to double check everything. I found no errors that were not made by me when entering the data. The program picked up Quicken entries flawlessly. This is important to me, since I make heavy use of Quicken for all of my finances including all of my buying and selling of stocks. It was especially important this year, since like most people who invest, I had some carry over losses from 2008. The program also imported information from last year's taxes without problem. It also imported tax information from 2008 TT for one of the returns with no problem. This saves typing.  In my case, the W-2 imports were not available (the same would have been True in TT) because of my particular employment. Hand entering the W-2 information was trivial. Bottom line. H&R Block's State plus Federal tax program is easy to use, accurate, and a much better value than the high priced TT. I also like the fact that you could do an unlimited number of tax returns and a generous number of e-filings.

43843,4,H&R Block,106.4,"01 23, 2010","I have been using TaxCut for many years and this year (with a new title) continues my personal tradition of getting my taxes done early and accurately. There was only one year (about 7 or 8 years ago) that I used something else because TaxCut was terrible. All the other years, it has been the best.

A few years I had to use accountants because of the complexity of my taxes for those years. After the number of obvious mistakes that they made, I went back to doing it myself. I got tired real quick of having to pay a lot for my taxes to be done wrong and have them delivered to me on April 13.

Although complete, there are a few (rare) forms missing and it would help if there was more information on-line and in the program. It is kind of awkward to have to go running off to the IRS site for a small but important piece of information. The program and the IRS are a little overeager to charge the AMT, even after the first time that it checks and says that I don't need to pay it. Also, there is something about my returns that makes the IRS want me to pay in advance quarterly, even though almost all of my income is only salary--not investments, etc.

They are making a lot of progress on the state versions. The first few years, I had to do half of the state forms myself. They have improved this every year and now it is as easy as the Federal version, even though state laws don't match up exactly with the federal version.

The error checking and other features of this program are really helpful, too. This year the e-mailing is included (it's about time!), although you can still file the paper forms or the reduced paper forms. You can always get a copy of your return or one form on paper--even halfway through the process, if you need it.

I have never had to use their call-in service because of the completeness of the program.

They have a service that will send you the next year's program on DVD so that you can start it and pay them online for it. I got that and then found out that Amazon's price was $5.00 less and I received it in two days.

As an aside, I am not real impressed that the same thing happened to TaxCut that has happened to a lot of companies lately. It has been purchased by a bigger company that didn't want to go to the trouble of competing with them.",Easy and accurate

This part written Dec 9, 2009 (see updated comments below)

This is of course a preliminary review (written Dec 9 based on use in the last few days). At this time one can't do more than a rough cut estimate of the tax return -- the IRS forms aren't finalized, the state forms aren't available, and of course the various income reports (W2, 1099, etc.) aren't out yet.

I don't have a super complicated tax situation this year: it just requires some things that a good tax program should handle easily. So far this program seems to do just fine. I found it easy to use, and found that imports from Quicken and from TXF files worked without any problems. Schedules A, B, and D worked just fine, and the related screens were easy to use and understand. Excess FICA was calculated correctly, as was the child tax credit. The AMT calculation does of course remain weirdly complicated (once a year I mutter to myself about all politicians in DC), but the program does take care of it with no apparent problems.

I used TaxCut last year -- chose it over TurboTax just because of cost, and was quite satisfied. I'm not convinced this year either that you get value for the extra you pay for TT. (Incidentally, note that if you have investment income you probably need to get TT Premium, so the price would be nearly double that of HRB Deluxe.)

A warning I wrote in my review last year seems worth repeating: Don't expect a tax program to apply tax laws correctly in all circumstances; for anything at all out of the ordinary, make sure you double-check against an IRS guide or another guide like JK Lasser's. The folks who design and write and test the programs make mistakes, too. And for the same reason, give the calculations a sanity check, don't just use the program blindly, or you could get tripped up by a software bug that wasn't caught.

I will update this review in Jan/Feb when I've had a chance to do more with it.

Update Jan 29, 2010:

I have now done a first complete pass on my taxes, based on W2s, 1099s, and some projected 1099s.  I also have had an opportunity to use TurboTax Deluxe (I got a free copy, legally), so have been able to compare the two products.

I continue to like HRB Deluxe.  It's easy to use, and has been trouble-free.  There are a couple of things I particularly like, that might be worth mentioning.  (1) They show you when the next update is expected, so you don't waste your time running the update check until there is something.  (2) Entering info from interest paying mutual funds that might have muni income (tax-free for Fed) is simple: HRB gives you a simple way to enter the amount that's tax-free in your state, and takes care of it without hassle.  TT can also deal with this, but I don't like their way as much (they create a separate 1099 to split the income into two parts).

Interestingly, TTD is also noticeably slower starting up than HRBD.  Don't know why.

The one advantage TT does have over HRB is on coverage of automated downloads: TT can download your 1099 info from a larger set of institutions than can HRB.  W2 downloads look the same between the two.  This does save some time, and could be sufficient to be a decider for some.  Not for me.",good product at a good price (updated)

43873,4,H&R Block,106.4,"03 23, 2010","I've used TaxCut (""At Home"") to prepare my taxes for over 10 years now. Although I've had my issues here and there with it, I always managed to successfully complete and file my taxes and have never had any of my federal or state returns questioned (knock on wood!). This includes several years of returns I had to amend/re-file (no fault of TaxCut). So I will stand by the program itself. However I do have my beefs...

Over the years I've been accustomed to their varieties of package/pricing options which at least seemed like fair practice, but I am very discontented over this e-file ""gimmick"". As someone who's been buying this program for many years, it appears they've simply increased the base rate of the product and then included the federal e-filing calling it ""free"". That's akin to a vendor charging $20 more for their DVD player and then saying it comes with a ""free movie""! I would rather save the $20 and choose to buy a DVD separately. Likewise I would rather pay less for the initial software and then choose to pay the e-file fee separately.

Now one may say ""what's the big deal if it works out to the same cost""? Well here's the big deal... more times than not I have been unable to e-file due to some ""disqualification"". I don't know if it's a TaxCut thing or an IRS thing, but it doesn't matter, bottom line is if I can't e-file then I get ZERO benefit from the e-file inclusion. Using my previous analogy, that's like not being able to play the ""free"" DVD that came with the DVD player!

Given this, I objected to paying the $40-45 most places were charging and had resolved to giving another package a try (TaxAct, which costs much less) until by chance I saw Amazon selling it for only $25. Well at that price I don't mind if I'm unable to e-file and if I can then all the better.

So that brings us to the download...

I was wary at first given other reviews plus some difficulty I had downloading music from Amazon a few months ago, but decided to go for it.

I initially purchased and tried downloading from my HP desktop running Windows 7. Amazon's downloader appeared to install correctly, but when I went to download the software I kept getting an ""unexpected error"". I tried following Amazon's troubleshooting suggestions, including adding their downloader to my firewall and rebooting, but still same problem.

For the heck of it I then tried downloading from my Toshiba laptop running Windows XP and lo and behold it downloaded fine on the first try! So maybe it's a Windows 7 issue, I can't say for sure.

Here's something to know though, you don't have to install the software on the PC you download from. After downloading from my laptop I moved the file over to my desktop and it installed just fine. (So TaxCut itself does not appear to have a problem with Windows 7) I haven't started actually entering data yet, but other than the initial download problem I can say so far so good and the price was right.",worthy purchase with some caveats

This year, my reminder email came through from H&R Block telling me how great the downloadable version was.  Having used the Online version for the last 3yrs I figured 'why not' - after all it says in can import from Tax Cut.

Having purchased and installed the software, and spent several hours researching, and then talking to customer support - it turns out the Downloadable version can NOT import from the Online version (but vice versa works apparently).

I am a homeowner who re-financed in 2009; I have a 401K, Roth IRA and have done a few stock trades.  Once I figured out where to enter a few key figures, by doing some Google searches, getting it right was fairly easy with no phone calls to a tax pro.  The Energy improvement form is a breeze and the check at the end saved me from leaving anything blank.  Well worth the savings by not buying Turbo Tax!!

KEY CODE TIP:  The BIGGEST snafu I had was the Key Code you need in order to get your FREE e-file....  It's provided back at Amazon.com by viewing your digital order, not anywhere in the H&R Block download.

Actually, I ordered program with $25 two days before lower price deal, but I could easily cancel my previous order via online, and then downloaded software.

i do not own a home, have a bunch of $ in stocks, etc. so i am easy when it comes to tax refund; however, it took me ~30 minutes to complete my fed + state.  1 nicety is that even tho i used tax pro last year, h&r pulled my personal info from tax pro so i didn't have to re-enter anything other than my change in address, w-2, etc.
then came the e-file!  i couldn't find it anywhere...not in my amazon email and not in the amazon folder (as some people have stated it is hidden).  i am very PC savvy (electrical & computer engineer) so believe me when i say i didn't receive it.  1 call to 1-800-HRBLOCK (1-800-472-5625) - after waiting 5 minutes for customer service - and i not only received a key code for fed but for state as well.  i simply let them know how frustrated i was with trying to find the fed key code and after they provided me with the fed key code i kindly asked if i could have a state key code.  it's worth a try!

43888,4,H&R Block,106.4,"01 31, 2010","I am a first time user of H&R Block Tax Cut, having previously used Turbo Tax for 10 years.  I switched to this product because I thought Turbo Tax was too expensive and I read MANY reviews on other web sites where customers reported serious problems with 2009 Turbo Tax using VISTA.

My desktop computer is a Dell XPS 420 running VISTA on a 64 bit platform.  By following the on screen directions, I had no problems downloading the software. I can see how a less experienced user might find it difficult to follow the steps, especially when the ""Read Me"" text document directs the user to open the H&R Block file to initiate the installation.

The program states that it can import data from Quicken and from the previous year's tax return.  When I tried to import my data from Quicken 2008, the H&R Block program failed and closed. I tried this 3 times without success. The only type of tax return file that was offered for importation was a .T08 file extension.  My 2008 tax return is saved in a .pdf format,and could not be imported.

Other than those 2 minor problems, I think the program works well.  I prefer to enter my data manually, so that problem was not significant.  It took me about 2 hours to finish my return.  I will wait until mid-February to submit the return electronically, so I don't know how well the e-file works.

Compared to previous versions of Turbo Tax that I've used, I think this product is better.  As another user mentioned, Turbo Tax has embedded ads and also installs junk software, even if you don't want it.  That is very, very annoying.",Satisfied with H&R Block at Home Deluxe 2009 Federal

And for those who worried that it does not transfer last yr data (from Turbo Tax) into current yr ~ H&R Block DO support Turbo Tax and it DOES pick all prior year data into current year filing and all personal information so NO need to input everything all over.
For business, it's somewhat complicated but I think it's difficult in general (that's why most business need to hired a tax general to do their tax) esp this is my first time doing business tax.  I have to spend long hours searching internet to answer questions on filing business tax and what tax forms do I need for my corporation.  At last, I am able to do it.

The one caveat I have is that H&R Block Business is based on software used by tax professionals. Specifically, the software copyright is owned by CCH, the tax reference and service company that has served tax professionals for decades. Consequently, the program is authoritative and thorough, but it's not as easy to use as the personal-return software and the instructions aren't written at a layman's level.  I have to relearn parts of it every year because I only do one return a year with it.

Anyhow, as they did last year, both programs install and update easily in Windows 7, both through the autostart installation program and by using the right-click menu to run (as administrator, to be safe) the tcauto.exe file on the disc. Individuals' installation problems probably arise from quirks in the software and/or hardware configurations of individual users' machines, a problem not limited to any particular software and difficult for a manufacturer's customer service to resolve remotely.

The Deluxe version seemed to have everything I needed to complete my return last year.  The product comes with five free return submissions which makes it an especially good deal (I usually have to re-submit my return at least once).

Another really great thing about this product is they have a free ""live chat"" feature where you can chat with a person about the product who actually knows what they are talking about for once.  I have used it a few times and was pleased.  I have not used ""live chat"" for actual tax law questions and I do not know if they provide that.","Overall, a good product"

43921,4,H&R Block,47.3333333333333,"04 23, 2011","I've been using the H&R Block tax software for six years now, probably because the first three years I got it free with my PC World subscription. It does make tax preparation less annoying, but it doesn't explain a few things very well during the process - so, if you're like me and know the tax code well enough to say ""hey, why can't I enter this deduction?"" at certain points, just be patient. The order in which certain things are done seems convoluted at times - for example, allocating the home-office portion of property taxes and utilities isn't done during the self-employment section as in past years (under Income) but during the deduction section. It's a leap of faith the first time, seeing your numbers being too high, but trust me they all work out in the end. You may also find yourself entering items under the wrong heading (i.e., cell phone expenses) because you aren't expecting this software to be as thoroughly detailed as it turns out to be. My advice - don't enter anything until prompted, and only when done should you go back to tuck in this and sneak in that.

This version actually covers most sole-proprietor businesses as long as they aren't sub-chapter S corporations. So, for example, if you are a victim of the current recession and are making ends meet as a handyman, this will suit your needs and prompt you to take all the legal deductions to which you're entitled - many of which an income-tax tyro probably won't be aware, doing them on paper. (This savings alone will pay for the software several times over.) It even allows for equipment depreciation, opening and closing inventory and more. I haven't bought the deluxe version of Tax Cut/At Home so I don't know how much more involved it gets; this seems good enough for my needs.

All things considered - not perfect, but pretty darned good. Skinflint tip - wait until March 15th for a price reduction, especially if - like me - you expect to be within $100 either way of your tax liability.","Worth buying, pays for itself in most cases"

Product Review:

I've used H&R Block's tax software every year since 2004. Always some annoyances, but most of it is excellent.

Price Dips: Below 25 buckss. Sometimes below 20. It went to 22.49 on Jan 12, 2011, for example. Amazon has always had the best price. There's an ""Online Price Alert"" that will email you whenever this or any amazon product dips below your target price. Google it. It's nicely done.

Unlimited number of tax returns: (family members, what-if copies of your return, etc.) I think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TurboTax/dp/B0043T6LHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TurboTax</a>&nbsp;also lets you do this now, but in the past TurboTax pulled some real nasty tricks with licensing/copy protection, and they continue to charge 18-45% more than H&R Block.

It includes unlimited paper filings for one state ($ 19.95 extra per state e-file). So, I just file state returns on paper.

""Free"" tax softwares like TaxAct might be the thing if your return is very simple, but their better versions are almost as expensive as H&R Block at low tide, and not as good.

The 2010 version is just like 2009. (I did a side-by-side run-through.)

Typical minor annoyances: (all carry-overs from 2009)

 - Upgrade pitches: They weave it into the interview and make it sound as if ""an upgrade to Premium is advised for your situation"" even when it makes little or no sense for your situation. Sleazy.

 - Unclear wording in a few places, although most wording is very clear and accurate.

 - Privacy Policy: Hard to view. Hard to read. Has reassuring tone, but doesn't hold much water.

 - Copy...Paste from Interview screens: That would be handy at times. No can do. Can't print them either. Only way I found is ALT + PrintScreen, then paste the graphic into Word or a paint program.",Mostly excellent. Some flaws. Price is nice.

Up to five members of your family can use it, so oldest daughter came home to file.  She had moved across the river from Indiana to Kentucky for a job in January 2010 and had to file two state returns.  She put off finishing her return until filing day, of course, and after finishing her Federal return found it was MUCH cheaper to buy another Fed + 1 state download online than to buy a second state with the copy I had bought (That's the first problem - fix the pricing structure!) Then, we had to go through a crazy routine - download the new program onto a second computer to not confuse the first program, and it got even worse from there.

1. Override Turbo Taxes numbers and forgo e-file.
2. Try to explain the error to Intuit and wait for a correction.
3. Do my entire return over again in H&R Block.

The efile for my federal return went in and was accepted quickly.  The program appears to be quite accurate.  All in all, I am quite happy.

Dislikes - While the federal efile is free, the state efile costs  $19.95.  While one state program came with the package, a second state program cost me $36.95 - more than the cost of the original program.

It has improved a bit from last years, especially in investment accounts import (it didn't have direct import from scottrade last year, it has, this year along with a bunch of others). But the import is still limited, as it cant match your buys and sells (you have to do the matching. It can be painful if you have too many trades, which luckily I didn't have this year.

The other annoyance is, it won't allow you state e-file if you have more than 13 short-term stock trades. I have no idea why, and as far as I know TurboTax has no such restrictions. One more thing about e-file: you have to pay $19.95 per state (though 5 federal e-files are included free).

Overall, it is OK. It works. But if your tax situation is very simple go for TaxAct online: it is free for federal e-file and cheap for state e-file.

As my life has gone from being single to married to having a house and kids it has made doing my taxes easy.  The questions are pretty straightforward, and as I've used it year after year it just imports a lot of the data entry from last year's forms (Social Security Numbers, W-2 ID numbers and the like).  Download was a snap.  I especially like the state option, as Vermont's tax system has gotten more and more complex and requires more and more forms.  Asking for the IRS to mail me a check, it took a few weeks but I had it by March 1.

Every year I've thought about jumping ship to Turbo Tax, and then I read a slew of reviews keeping me here.  Very early on, Tax Cut found me a $1,500 deduction/refund that I would never have thought of getting, so I still ride the positive emotions of that ""find"" as I click away at the questions.

That said, I have a sneaking suspicion I'm missing something.  Perhaps it's the middle class fear that the system is set up to rip me off, but in not having a personal tax accountant I worry that my money is not working hard enough for me, and that I am missing thousands in deductions without realizing it.  Some of my friends tell stories of their accountant and what they tell them is ""okay"" to deduct, which gets me thinking.  For the first time, I've thought of going and getting a review.  Still, a friend goes into the H & R Block offices and, from what he describes, it sounds like the guy behind the desk just goes through the same prompts as this.  Indeed, the program is so easy I find myself in a kind of haze and, in the end, its so easy I think I must have missing something because taxes are supposed to hurt, right?  There's research about how our brain makes choices based on the difficulties of the decision, and I fear the ease of this program is leading me to think my finances are nothing of consequence and I'll miss mistakes.  Yes, my Luddite mind is over thinking things.  I think I'm just bugged by the tax code, and wish we had a flat tax at this point.

43975,4,H&R Block,47.3333333333333,"02 13, 2011","I'm surprised by the number of negative comments. After reading many of them, it appears that most are about downloading or importing additional information from other software. I haven't experienced any of those problems.

First, the download from Amazon was simple and easy. You do have to be careful and pay attention to where Amazon says it is putting it on your computer. I actually thought the download hadn't worked the first time, but when I went back, I found the program exactly where Amazon said it would be -- it just wasn't where I thought it would be in the first place. Nevertheless, the download itself was simple and Amazon's software library is great because if you lose the file or need to reinstall it, Amazon will allow you to do so from your personalized software library. A great ""peace-of-mind"" aspect to their service.

Second, we have a small home-based business, so we need to file a Schedule C (and several other documents). I've used the deluxe version of this program for the last 10 years and have found it to be wonderful. I've had a professional tax consultant review the results a few times and he has been impressed with the detail that is included in the program. The questions are simple and easy to understand. It does take a while, but if your files are in order, you can be finished in one evening. The program did try to get us to upgrade once, but it was only once, and I can't fault them for doing so. They are a business and trying to sell a product, why wouldn't they advertise other options available to consumers? It was certainly not annoying, and a single click to tell them ""no thank you"" gets you on your way to the next part of the interview. We also have an older computer, but this year's version loaded just fine.

Third, my only gripe with this is the customer support from H&R Block. (and this is the reason why I gave it 4/5) I downloaded the state program (again, a simple process). However, when it was completed, I had a question about one of the deductions allowed for my state. At the time, it didn't appear that the program was putting in the correct number. I called Customer Support, and they had no easy answer and the person I spoke with had trouble calling up my state form. I find this ridiculous. All I wanted to know was how a particular line on my state form was calculated, and she couldn't tell me. It's not that she thought I needed to talk to a tax consultant and was refusing to answer, she just didn't know the answer to what I thought was a rather simple question. After being on the phone for 48 minutes, I happened to stumble across something from my state's tax website, which gave me the answer. You can be sure that I alerted the CS representative and made sure she knew to tell her supervisor that I was not pleased that they didn't have the answer.

So, overall -- it's a great product for simple and more complicated tax returns. I've been pleased with the product for the last ten years, and Amazon's download price was 40 percent off Walmart's best price locally, so that was an added plus. The product is easy to interact with. I was just sorely disappointed with the lack of knowledge from the customer support team.

Key Highlights
*Amazon's software downloader was problem-free, fast, and easy
*Software imported my 2009 data from my computer - saved me lots of time
*DeductionPro is now online - interview takes you to it and it is easier than the 2009 version of DeductionPro
*Efile is still easy, free, and fast
*State software was downloaded when I prompted - fast, quick, easy.
*Software warned me that it may take longer to get refund since IRS is not accepting returns with itemized deductions until mid-Feb. I was happy to be warned of this possibility since otherwise I would have been angry that my refund wasn't processing like in years past.

The only reason why I give this software 4 out of 5 stars is because I still think that tax software is not 100% reliable as speaking with a CPA or real live person who does your taxes. I do have a couple of questions and although the software does answer it to the best of its ability, I sometimes worry that I'm making a mistake or not doing my return correctly. It is always a risk I take and so far I have not had any problems with the IRS or any personal tax liability issues so I believe I'm doing my taxes correctly.

If you need live advice, it's available for an extra $20 fee. At some point, it becomes a better value to take it into a professional. But if you can swing it on your own without additional asssistance, this is the way to go.

Note that this does not include any state e-filing fees (only federal). This version includes federal e-filing for up to five federal returns.

1). No problem installing either the At Home Premium or Business module.  Had no problem importing the 2010 data for either the business or personal returns.  You need to note that the business return file is embedded in the software.  Therefore, you should not uninstalled the prior year's software until you are done with this year' return.  The personal return is saved on the hard driver as a .Txx (e.g. .T10 or .T11) file, and therefore does not have this problem.

2). In the Interview screenings of the Business software, the boxes and labels initially are mis-aligned, but this was fixed by changing the display DPI to the normal 96.  Other than that, the Business software is fairly easy to use if you have some previous experience doing business tax returns.

3). The at Home Premium, as usual, works great.

But every year they would raise the price by like $5 bucks-- even with a horrible economy with NO inflation to speak of. Just greedy. So, this year I went with H&R Block because it was $15 cheaper, and because I wanted to support a competitor to TurboTax (to keep them honest). The software works with no problems on my Windows 7 x64 machine. Had no problems at all installing, using software. Good solid software, so I'm glad I chose to save the $15. Only thing I didn't like-- and TurboTax was better about-- was the ""filing"" part. The HR Block software was a little confusing at the end:
-- I e-Filed my Federal, but printed and mailed my state. After e-filing, the software didn't go directly to the state filing process. I had to figure out how to get there on my own.
-- The ""cover page"" that gets printed when you print your state return explains what you need to do to mail your return. It's confusing because it mentions that ""In addition to the forms the program will print for you, you must review the items below for any other documents required by your state..."" It then lists things that may or may not have been part of your federal returns; If they were, it explains how to go to them in the federal return and print them. I think that's lame: if I need them and they are part of my federal return, just print them for me!

44052,4,H&R Block,47.8666666666667,"03 11, 2012","Thank you for a great review, C. MacPhail. For a record, today the price dipped to $18.99 :)  NY state e-filing is free, as it becomes a mandatory this year. So if you file for NY state only, it will be only $18.99! Very cheap compared to Turbotax.

For everybody's consideration, I share my two cents as I happened to try all THREE major filing methods this year: an accountant, Turbotax(online trial version), and, H&R block software (a free promotion CD as I was a user in past). My conclusion is, all has pros and cons, you will need to pay your own attention to be accurate as possible, because none of them are perfect - just C. MacPhail and others said.

My accountant I hired was clearly wrong in a few tricky areas (bank interests, part-time state residency etc) which were originally the reasons why I initially intended to work with her this year - I've filed only with software before - to save the time for research/worries on those things. Why I found she was wrong? Because I used a free, promotional H&R Block software this year (it was mailed to me) to compare side by side as well as Turbotax's free draft online just in case. I know I'm a bit unusual, but at the same time I was so curious how much she could save money more than software - it turned out to be opposite! She came back with $1700 state PAYMENT while both software said $2500 REFUND. This is a too big difference to ignore.

Of course less refund does not mean incorrect, she could be right, the most importance is accuracy than more refund, so I even researched on IRS/state websites, tax advice websites and H&R block and Turbotax articles, and confirmed that my accountant was absolutely wrong and I was shocked how much a professional could be wrong; I could be filing wrongly for less refund, I pay more fee than software, then I might get audited so I have to hire an accountant again to represent?! So crazy. She was definitely acting professionally and caring in terms of communication, took time to explain why she did this, and nice enough to let me go without charging at all stating she was not comfortable in my case. But when her knowledge is wrong, that's wrong, I can't trust her work. I also found she was not particularly proactive to suggest any tax saving tips/questions either as she is already busy with her other clients...

So I'd say, if you don't want to worry or don't have a time at all for DIY, your tax situation is way complicated, AND if you have found a great accountant you can trust, the high price for accountants worth it. I thought I carefully selected this accountant by interviewing several ones based on people's recommendations/Yelp reviews, confirming she said she could handle my situations before hiring her, but still her job was wrong where I concerned, and she gave up on my case at end. Maybe it is my fault choosing her, but she does have a good background/experience/reviews on my resume!!!

For tax tips, I feel software definitely does a better job (the problem is that you have to understand and translate into your case by yourself; this is where accountants are supposed to be better when they knows your situation inside out and have a time to care and ask). I'd say, if you are fairly confident with software and go by price, H&R block software is definitely an winner. Turbotax does have more sophisticated user interface (as suggested in C. MacPhail's review), but H&R block software did suggest some tax tip better than Turbotax while H&R block made me nervous when it lets me get in actual form to enter numbers, in my case.

If you could, try both before paying, and go for which you felt comfortable. The both software is comparable, it is really a personal preference and convenience. You could try an accountant too like I did, but remember, we could get audited/get errors even if we pay more $$$ to the accountant. Since there will be always a chance to get audited with any method, why don't we go for software which is cheaper and actually more time-saving if you are an worried type like me.

The 2011 version is much like 2010.

You can save money by waiting for price dips (see below).

Unlimited number of tax returns: (family members, what-if copies of your return, etc.) 5 Federal e-Files included. Nice!

Unlimited paper filings for one state ($ 19.95 extra per state e-file). So, I just file state returns on paper.

I would say it delivers huge bang for the buck.

The amazon price swings mostly between 25 and 40 (see Note 2). Amazon has almost always had the best price. There's an ""Online Price Alert"" that will email you whenever this or any amazon product dips below your target price. Google it. It's nicely done.

These are all carry-overs from 2010

 - Upgrade pitches: They weave it into the interview and make it sound as if ""an upgrade to Premium is advised for your situation"" even when it makes little or no sense for your situation. Sleazy.

 - Unclear wording in a few places, although most wording is very clear and accurate.

 - Privacy Policy: Hard to view. Hard to read. Has reassuring tone, but doesn't hold much water.

 - Copy...Paste from Interview screens: That would be very handy at times. No can do. Can't print them either. Only way I found is ALT + PrintScreen, then paste the graphic into Word or a paint program.

Note 1: Early Versions: Before the mid-January update, it may not reflect all tax law changes, but I was able to punch in all my numbers and do some valuable ""what-if"" scenarios before year end (Federal only. No state modules were available as of January 1.) You can easily flag your estimated numbers as ""Tentative"" so they won't get accidentally included on your final return.

Note 2: Price History: If history is a guide, you can get this on amazon for about 25 bucks sometime in January. (Price dropped to $20 for 1 day on January 7, 2012). I plotted last year's price history as a pic and uploaded it, but amazon removed it on Dec 22.",Mostly excellent. Some flaws. Price is nice

It does the EXACT same thing that H&R Block software does.  They both walk you through every bit of your return, asking lots of questions to determine how and what you should file.  They really are almost identical in the way the software is laid out.  So for 2 years I used Turbotax and then switched to Taxcut (now called H&R Block At Home), and I found nothing that would make me want to pay nearly 50% more for the Turbotax software!

One important note:  I've seen some reviewers talking about 'bugs' in the software.  Bugs are VERY common in most software programs and come up from time to time.  The biggest favor you can do for yourself is always CHECK YOUR RETURN ON YOUR OWN.  Once the software has finished, print the information and go over it yourself.  Check each line carefully and get out your calculator and do all the math too!  One tiny little glitch could delay your refund.

I called HR Block support, which led me to a tech support person who was completely clueless as to what I was trying to tell her; instead she kept insisting that I must have entered bad data, because that must be the reason behind any problem: user error!

After trying to explain the situation several times, I finally told her that I am a software programmer with years of experience who knows a bug when she sees one, and all I was trying to do is to (1) report the bug and (2) hope to find out whether or not I really have an audit risk.

Ultimately the only help she could provide was to give me the telephone number of the local HR Block office, which was much more helpful;

However, either way, neither person was able to report this bug on my behalf, (and I could find no link on their web site) which leads me to wonder how any software error can get fixed.  And I have a relatively simple return!

I've found Tax Cut to be consistently usable and easy to understand.  The 2011 product is no exception.  I bought the download version, and had no download or installation problems (running on an XP machine).  Our return is mildly complicated, with investments (mutual fund distributions and sales) and pensions with a partial basis, which requires some allocation of the basis and non-basis portion.  Block At Home Deluxe handled all this with ease.

One star off, however, because Block removed a useful form from the program.  They've always had a Two Year Summary, a side-by-side comparison of this year's return and last year's return.  It's the first thing I look at once my return is done, because it gives me some way to think about income, deductions, and taxes from one year to the next.  Now that form is gone.

I commend H&R Block (and Intuit for that matter) for being much more visible on their pricing this year. The comparison chart clearly states that the state e-file is an additional $19.95.

44165,4,H&R Block,55.9,"10 28, 2012","I've been using TaxCut since at least 1994 to do fairly complex returns including Schedule C, Schedule D and Schedule E. Although the program isn't perfect -- especially the state versions (CA, NY, PA) which leave too much in my hands for my taste -- I've learned its quirks over the years and the opportunity cost of switching to (say) TurboTax seems too high to me.

I bought a cheap copy of TurboTax for 2010 after the 2010 tax season and re-entered about half of my 2010 tax data into that program to see if it seemed to be better than TaxCut, especially since I now use Quicken for my accounting program and Intuit makes both Quicken and TurboTax. I was disappointed that TurboTax was no easier to use than TaxCut and, because I was having to learn it, I couldn't move as quickly through the program. My impression by the time I stopped my experiment is that TurboTax didn't have any improvements that seemed worthy of making a change and its unfamiliar interface had its own learning curve.

So, for me, TaxCut continues to be my tax preparation program of choice. Now that I'm in PA, the state version of the program also works better for me, largely because the PA form is pretty simple. After I've done another return or two, I may even stop buying the PA state version since it is $20 and doesn't do much for that price simply because the PA return is so simple.

One last thing: eFiling

Since my version of the program provided free Federal efiling, and since the IRS will now accept efiling of complex returns like mine -- as recently as 2010 they did not -- I efiled this year. The only problem I had was that I couldn't successfully ""sign"" the submission by entering 2010's AGI figure. After calling the IRS to find out what the problem was (as I was told to do by TaxCut when I couldn't successfully efile), apparently if one is efiling for the first time, the correct answer to the AGI question for the previous year is $0. Once I made that change, the efile happened smoothly. Presumably, efiling 2012 will require using the 2011 AGI figure.

Since I had efiled the Federal return, I decided to try efiling the PA return. That cost me another $20 and didn't really achieve my goal of not having to go to the Post Office to mail the return since after efiling I was informed by the program that I needed to mail some supporting documentation (i.e. copies of 1099s) to PA anyway. So, going forward, I'll just print the PA return and will mail all of the stuff together for a savings of $14 or so (since I mail stuff to the tax man using certified mail w/return receipt, it costs about $6 in postage).",Still my favorite tax program

I searched extensively on the web to find a solution, but didn't, and was about to give up and reenter all my information into an efile tool on the IRS web site.  I wasn't looking forward to that because the return had a lot of info.

However, after studying the printed 1040 forms, I found the place where the IP PIN actually ends up, which is near the signatures on page 2 of the 1040.  Next, I went into the H&R Block software and navigated directly to the 1040 form, and I was able to enter the IP PIN way at the bottom, beneath the field for the daytime phone number.  And then -- voila! -- I was able to e-file.

H&R Pros

Significantly less glitch prone than 2010 Software
Easy Step By Step ""in plain English"" instructions for most sections
Explanations of what each section does
Explanations about what has changed from the previous year
Auto-loads all information from the previous version
""Risk Monitor"" gives you peace of mind when you're done
5 Free federal uploads

H&R Cons:

Lower federal return amount than last year
Poor explanation of what can be deducted in the state section
Very little guidance through sub sections that deal with specific lists
In the final stages the software will ""loop"" continuously when it gets to the state return

Overall I'd say that H&R is easier and more user friendly. TurboTax is more thorough, but less user friendly, and has far more glitches. (I had to re-submit last year with TurboTax).

My only complaint is that my error was so hard to locate and the software didn't give any warnings.

The only down side is that I must still pay the good old IRS.",Good experience with this product
44212,4,H&R Block,167.986666666667,"02 7, 2013","I downloaded this software for my Macbook (Mountain Lion). Overall, the experience was very positive. This is the first year that my wife and I have not relied on the accountant that does one or the other of our parents' returns to do our taxes. Our taxes are relatively simple, since our income is all reported on various forms to the IRS, we don't have much personal property, investments, extraneous income, etc. I was curious about preparing our own taxes and figured that if there was ever a year to try the software out, this was it.

THE POSTIVE: The download is pretty straightforward and the program runs great. The interface is clean and simple and asks a series of questions that take you only to data entry forms that are relevant to you. I had no trouble with putting in my wife's multiple W-2s. The software was also informative, and I know have a much better idea of what I need to do this coming year to improve my deductions. At the end of the process, you select a state module and the program carries over relevant info from your federal return to make things simpler. When filing the return you have the option of eFiling the federal and state returns and or a ""print forms and mail"" option. eFiling the federal return was quick and easy, while I printed the state forms to avoid a fee. Next year I will likely use the software again, and it will be interesting to see how well it deals with the additional complications my finances are likely to gain over the next year.

THE NEGATIVE: There were a few catches to this software that I did no like. The first is that hitting ""back"" doesn't always take you to the previous screen, but often takes you to the screen that was the beginning of the section you are in. This gets a little confusing and makes things complicating. Also, I attempted to do some what if scenarios by guessing numbers for certain itemized deductions to see if it was worth me digging out the documents and crunching numbers, but it's not clear to me at what point data you enter gets computed into your refund. Several times I entered amounts that should have been deductible and hit ""next"" only to see no change on the refund.

Another major complaint I have is that your download comes with only ONE free chat session. I really don't think this is made very clear on the Amazon purchase page, and it certainly is not stated when you click the ""get chat help"" button in the program. As a result, I used my only free help session when I hit my first question, when I should have just wrote my concerns down through the process and then chatted once at the end and asked all my tax questions. Obviously, that's what I recommend you do. Additional sessions are $19.95 each! Along the same lines of hidden costs, my wife and I moved this past year so we needed to file two state returns. The software initially made this seem like no big deal. The first state downloaded with no problems and I completed that return. When it came time for the second state, however, the software wanted $40!!! Forty dollars for each additional state. That's more than the whole program! I downloaded the state forms myself and spent several hours reading instructions. It was a horrible pain and I was more than a little peeved. If you have just moved I would check to see if Turbotax charges for each state because it may end up being cheaper than this program if they don't. If you do decide to go with H&R Home Deluxe, I recommend downloading the state with the highest tax rates and/or the most complicated returns.

Finally, I'm not convinced that the software actually computes everything right with regard to scholarship/fellowship income. I input income from my 1098-T (scholarship income reporting from my university) including both wages and tuition expenses, and got a much higher tax amount than I got when I actually went to the IRS website and read the criterion for tax exempt fellowships. By my reading, almost all of the money should have been exempt, while the software wanted me to pay taxes on it. Further, the software never asked my any questions about the money about the criterion given online that would have made it tax exempt. So that's a concern that I have.

Overall, as I said, the experience was positive and I ""liked"" the program.","Great user experience, some catches"

And the price differential is pretty steep.  This is certainly an excellent _value_.  I ran into only two problems: first, there was an apparent refund for payment for the 2012 year which I had to finally just count as miscellaneous (that's probably not the right approach, but the application weakness is that it didn't really help here), and confusion about printing forms for filing (it's unclear how options chosen in the printing dialog - in this case, I believe it was the option to include worksheets - prevent printing of the return/forms without the ""Not for filing"" legend printed on them).

But in general, it went satisfactorily.  I guess the most serious complaint that I have is the same as with all ""financial"" software, at least in the Mac market: because of the variability in experience of those using the applications, there really is no way to have any feedback, questions, or suggestions responded to.  In other words, this is a high-volume and low-support product; the publisher can't really provide any support because the cost structure is prohibitive.  They would literally have several million questions to answer if they made it less difficult.  So - you have to take it as it's given, and deal with the warts.

It takes a little getting used to the difference in the interface, but after that, you're good to go.

I did find a serious error in the 2011 calculations (amount paid in State tax was effectively being deducted twice from Federal) which was corrected after I submitted an example.  Before doing my actual return, I always input a very simplified return using dummy data with nice round numbers in order to catch any obvious mistakes.

The current 39.99 price is too high.  I expect to be able to get it for 34.99 or preferably 29.99 after the first of the year.  If you know you're not getting a refund, you can afford to wait and see if the price comes down.  If you're like me and like to stay on top of things, and you have the 2012 tax year version, you can use it to run an estimate for 2013 - for most people, there aren't any significant changes in Federal tax laws.  Doing this may slightly overestimate the amount you owe, because the ceilings on the tax brackets are raised slightly each year by a couple thousand dollars.

44301,4,H&R Block,81.32,"03 22, 2014","I have used Turbo Tax for the last decade.

  I royally screwed up my taxes by contributing too much to HSA accounts for both my wife and I over the last five years.  We had separate HSA accounts through our employers, and I contributed the maximum for individual and my wife contributed maximum for family for five years.  Only until year five did TT's  warning seem ominous enough for me to look into this excess contribution that we were supposedly making.

  I know, I'm an idiot for not knowing that since we both had HSA accounts that we were limited to just a family deduction.  Regardless, it was my fault, and I was paying a 6% tax on this money every year until I knew it was there.  Finally, I was able to pull it out of our HSA accounts as excess contributions and was ready to move on with my life.  TT could not calculate this withdrawal...

 I spent  several days talking with support experts who recommended several ""workarounds"" (since TT could not calculate correctly, according to the experts) that ended up giving me a large tax return instead of the taxes that I should have been paying (There are multiple posts dating back at least three years as to the ineffectiveness of TT software dealing with HSA's). I spent  a week  working on this!

In the mean time, I googled my problem, and it came up with a review from Amazon that mentioned my problem in it's context and that H&R block's tax software took care of his problem (It was actually a wide ranging, informative, well put together review... unlike this one.)  I figured I would give H&R block a try while I worked through my problems with TT, as I was almost done with my taxes except for this one HUGE problem.  H&R was able to download my previous TT tax return, which made things a little quicker.  When I got to the HSA section I entered my info and was pretty irritated that it wasn't calculating it correctly either... or so I thought!  I expected a big hassle like I got at TT, having to alter numbers, and make it ""work"".  I entered my 1099-SA amounts and it calculated it perfectly and took away the excess contribution which TT was unable to do!

 I think Turbo Tax is easier to work with, but I think the calculations may be more accurate with H&R. If you have an HSA I would definitely use H&R!",If you have an HSA this is the tax software for you!!!

While I was correct about the security dangers of using an administrator account, it turns out all software must be installed using an administrator account; then you can switch to a regular account when running the software to keep your computer more secure (FYI installing updates also requires the administrator account).  I took one star away for the customer support I got when I phoned in.  They told me I could not download the state until I finished my federal form; not True.  I tried it and it worked.  So, if you are not the administrator, you don't have to keep seeking access to the administrator account for installation of Federal, for latest updated version of Federal, for installation of state, and latest updated version of State; it can all be done at one time.  Their customer support is also annoying because I suspect they train them not to answer the question, ""What is the current update version number for the Federal ...and for my state?""

Back when in the 60's some states did not allow you to write off any contributions to an IRA Account but stated, that when you started to withdraw the funds after reaching a mandatory age, that you did not have to pay any taxes on that which you withdrew until you recovered your basis. I brought this to their attention two years ago and they said they would correct it, but in 2014 when running the program they had not and the only way to declare the basis was to manually go into the state subtraction area where IRA is entered and  then to input that information there in.

One tip for installation; enter your activation code and registration information BEFORE fetching any available IRS updates. If you attempt to get updates first (like the installer prompts you to do) the installer will hang. Just skip the update step, enter your activation code and registration info, and the installer will load the program onto your computer in just a few minutes.

As a result, I had to efile an incomplete return that not include the electric vehicle credit and then manually submit an amended return to get the credit.

Last year, with all of the glitches in Turbotax, some of the state departments of revenue re-examined (audited) the tax returns of those who they identified as filing with Turbotax. Mine was one of those, and I was sent a letter stating that ""I"" calculated my taxes incorrectly and that I owed additional money. A friend who lives in Minnesota, and who knew about my issue with Turbotax, forwarded me an article which essentially stated that the Minnesota Department of Revenue went as far as to warn people not to use Turbotax (see [...]). So when I saw this product on an Amazon Lightning Deal for about $30, I bought it. The software includes efiling of up to 5 federal returns, and it includes one state product (though if you want to e-file the state, that costs extra. . . but you can always just print out the state return for free and mail it in to your state department of revenue, for the cost of an envelope and about three first-class stamps).  I was very happy with the software, and felt it was easy to work my way through it. I was able to import all of the necessary information from my previous return, even though that return was prepared with Turbotax and not H&R Block. I was able to import 1099s and W-2s directly from the employers' payroll systems, the banks, and the brokerage firms, making it super easy to use and less susceptible to human typographical error.

Almost everything about it felt smoother, faster and more intuitive. The import from my previous year's return was quick, and seemed a bit more complete, the updates were timely and fast, and I experienced only one minor bug in the NY State portion. E-filing was effortless this year for both state and federal returns.
  Block and all the retailers play pricing games throughout the tax season, so shop around. In any case, Block always seems cheaper than Turbo-Tax, a major selling point in my opinion.

It is nothing like the system they have in place in the offices but that proprietary software is probably the very best system available and would be prohibitively expensive on the open market. It does everything but hold your hand!

Although the software gets the job done very well I do not like not being able to clearly see the actual forms I am filling out. I use the Schedule E for rental property and like to fill out the form directly and this system allows one to see the form but it somehow looks different. When I printed it out I was satisfied that everything was done as I intended. The previous year's information downloaded seamlessly to the new year so there was no need to key in old information.

All in all I was satisfied with the result but I think Block could make the software more intuitive and user friendly. I had an advantage when I did my taxes this year in that I had already downloaded the forms from the IRS and had figured out everything manually so I was able to keep track of anything missing.

For one thing, TaxCut comes with audit protection included. That is, if the IRS comes calling, you will have help.

More importantly, the program is easy to follow, and it works. Updates actually install. They do not break the program and prevent it from running -- my experience last year with TurboTax, which forced me eventually to install the program on an entirely new computer in order to be able to complete the job. An incredible time waster, and frustrating.

TaxCut is relatively inexpensive, and also includes free Federal and State filing.

But, as the first poster described, it is annoying and REALLY odd how Amazon does the download. It actually doesn't download the software app, but downloads an installer for the app.  It can be confusing for a lot of folks.
WHY DO THAT?

I love Amazon. They are great. If I could tell them one thing: Make your digital downloads easier. The way it is now, scares some folks.

UPDATE: January 25th 2014:
Thanks for e-filing. We've submitted your federal return to the IRS. We'll send you an e-mail with the status of your return once the IRS processes it.

To check your status in the H&R Block program:

Connect to the Internet as you normally would.
Open H&R Block. On the Welcome, find the return that you e-filed. Make sure you open the return file that you transmitted and not a duplicate copy.
Click the Check Status link next to the file name.
Follow the instructions provided.
If you've navigated away from the Check Status screen, you can check the status again by following these steps:

Open H&R Block. Be sure to open the return that you initially e-filed.
Go to the File menu, and click Check Status.",On the internet. No knows you're a dog.

I imported last year's tax return data into this year's return and didn't have to type names, addresses, Social Security numbers, or anything else really.  I used the import W-2 feature and it worked flawlessly. The free e-file is great and makes filing very easy.  I filed the week before April 15th, had confirmation back within 5 minutes, and had the (small) refund deposited within 5 days.

I definitely recommend H&R Block over TurboTax. I used TurboTax for years until we had a small incorporated business.  TurboTax couldn't handle the business return, so I switched to H&R Block... now that the business is gone, we still use H&R Block and are happy for it.",Good tax software

I am running OS X Mavericks on my Mac Mini and the software runs just fine. The H&R Block website states that this software will run on a mac with an operating system as far back as OSX 10.5.8.  I have successfully filed both my federal and state tax returns with this software and overall I am pleased.

Good:

-You get 5 free Federal E-files included with the purchase.
-It's very user friendly and asks you all the right questions so you don't have to be a tax expert.
-Amazon makes it super easy to purchase and download the software.
-All of your info is stored locally instead of online. This is great if you won't have access to internet while you're working on your return. (Traveling etc.)
(Keep in mind you WILL need an internet connection to update the software and also to E-file when you're finished)

Bad:

-Customer service was not good! I called with a few questions about the difference between the online portal and the software and they couldn't answer them.
- They don't make it clear that even though you buy Federal and State programs, you have to pay to e-file your state return. ($19.95 via credit card)
-There is no way to import your tax data from the prior year if you did it through the H&R Block website like I did.

UPDATE: My state of CT program has been released and I have successfully e-filed my 2013 taxes with this software with no issues.

If you've never done your own taxes, it is pretty user friendly, however if you have a complicated return it can get difficult. You really have to have a tight grip on your personal finances and tax terminology especially if you own a house, a small business or trade stocks. If you run into issues, your best bet is seeing a real live person at an H&R Block retail location. You'll pay more but you won't risk facing major penalties in case of an audit or leaving a lot of money on the table you could be getting back.

Note -- > print your activation code that comes with the install when presented (though you can get again later from AMAZON if you lose it)

 So I will list what I found so far :

The first time you run it it will automatically check for Federal Updates. Do NOT do it then, cancel. Until you complete the ACTIVATION it will  crash. This could be fixed, but they never do from year to year is seems to be the same.

After activation the Federal update will work. Be advised it take s a long time as it ""checks"". Since there are no indications that things are going fine as it goes along, it appears it is hung. Nope, just takes a long time. I think it takes long because there are no  2013 tax returns to find yet.

As far as I remember, the above has always been this case from year to year and it makes a new or inexperienced user concerned right from the start.

One more note- if you have to do more than one State (such as you live in one and work in another) I would not use this product. My experience is that it never handles it well and there is great chance of errors the way it is designed.

Taxes are not easy and the government changes a lot each year. H&R Block Tax Software Premium & Business 2013 Win makes it easy, clear and inexpensive to do the work if you can follow instructions, keep good records and think just a bit.

Check out the Software rankings for Amazon and you will see many use this product year in, year out. I just made a sheet of steps front to back in a spreadsheet and copy that workbook forward year to year and note any changes, new questions, etc.

I do tend to wait until about Mid February or so to buy the package. Then I download it, follow the instructions to install on Windows (I installed on Windows 7 64 bit this year), then:

1) Then open the Business Software Package (due 3/15) and run Update the Software Option (By mid February its ready).
2) Restart the program as prompted
3) Choose Return option (to import if you used it last year) (radio buttons were not aligned but selected the second option). A little clumsy but worked great and pulled in my old info.

And I am on my way.

Only reason I downgraded to four star from five star was the text alignment issue on radio buttons. Likely will be fixed in an update, but just counted to the text blurb I wanted to select and used the respective radio button. Easy enough but not five star. Didn't see a help item either. Might be my wide monitors.

Will update if need be, but looks great just like last year.",Best Tax Setup ever for my Personal and S Corp for both State and Federal

44583,4,H&R Block,80.99,"04 13, 2014","The price was right compared to having your return prepared in a H&R Block office.

The software was easy to use and worked well. Having been a professional tax preparer at H&R Block for 21 years may have been why I felt the software was easy to use and the step by step guide through your return was simple to follow.

Two improvements could be made however. I had expected the software to search H&R Block's internal database and pro-forma my last year return which I filed at the office I worked at last year. They have all the data on-line and it is available in my ""My Block"" account on-line. Why not suck it in when starting this years return.

Another thing that disappointed me was the way the program calculated our Georgia retirement exclusion. When dividend income, interest income, capital gains and rental income were entered on the Federal return it was designated as taxpayer, spouse or joint. When calculating the retirement exclusion for Georgia all were credited to the taxpayer. To maximize our retirement exclusion I had to use a calculator and go back to the source documents and the Federal return to apply the amounts properly. It ought to be simple to keep track of who the income belongs to, our office software did a fine job of taking care of that.

I'll probably buy the software again next year but had expected more from Block this year.",Does a great job but could do better in some areas

So I had both refunds in about two weeks after submitting my returns.

(form 1099B) gives a lot of required income and deductions on the form.  However you have to know at the bottom their is a figure for
security sales. You have to go to a different section to get the info for sales & cost. HR ask for date of purchase and date of sale.
If you are using grouping totals provided by ML, you can fill in VAR-L for multiple dates long term and VAR-S for short term.  Then on the review  HR says your data review requires a specific date.

44704,4,H&R Block,47.3333333333333,"04 13, 2015","Like several other reviewers I switched to HRB Deluxe from TT because of the fiasco at TT.  The HRB software performed quite well and it is substantially cheaper (even Deluxe vs Deluxe).  In many ways I like the HRB better because it has less unneeded stuff (pictures of people asking questions and the like).

There were two glitches that surprised me--I suppose they do call into question the overall integrity of the program.  Both relate to estimated tax computation so if you don't pay estimated taxes you would not encounter them.

First when you fill in the HRB Tax Payment Planner it correctly computes the estimated tax payments.  But the data doesn't show up on the Form 1040 ES that they recommend you print and retain for your records.  Interestingly the vouchers that come with the 1040 ES have the correct amounts for the estimated payments even though the data is not transferred correctly or at all for most of the entries you make.

Second when the program computes your estimated taxes (in my case it came to a total number divisible evenly by 4) you get 4 equal payments (one for each quarter).  But then if you have the first payment paid by reducing the refund on your 1040, the program says you still owe $1 for the first quarterly payment and then adds $1 to each of the remaining 3 quarterly payments.

Probably most folks don't care much about this (apparently HRB does not either--I offered to help them try to fix it and they were dismissive as if it's not a problem) and you can pretty easily compute your estimated taxes manually to be sure they are correct.  But a program that is meant to compute things for you should not put you to the effort.  And as I indicated above it does call into question the integrity of all calculations (if this one is glitched perhaps others are as well).  And I spent a fair amount of time trying to figure what I was doing wrong before deciding the problem is with the program (an on line chat person was very interested and accommodating but was unable to figure out a solution--she suggested someone up the ladder would want to chat with me, but the only further response from up the chain was dismissive--not the perfect attitude, but hey, this is really bargain software when you buy it from Amazon for around $20).

This works, it does the job, it imported last year's data from TurboTax just fine, and the taxes are done and away. The one really annoying thing is it seems to think that its users have difficulty reading, so instead of just describing something, it sends one to a YouTube video of someone reading off the description. If I had some need of text-to-speech the computer can handle that just fine; I'd really like to just have text telling me what something is. I don't need someone to read it to me.

I opted for the $20 cheaper H&R Block Deluxe version.  It's much improved from the last time I tried it (2001 when it was called TaxCut).  Just as easy and straightforward to use as TurboTax.  I just completed my return and I only encountered one major problem in downloading some mutual fund transactions from Ameriprise. The fund names came in garbled.  It was some work to correct the info, but not much more than filling out the forms from scratch. Thanks, H&R!",Just as good for nearly half the price
44723,4,H&R Block,47.3333333333333,"03 29, 2015","From a quick look at my TAX folder on my PC I have been using tax software since at least 2001. I have definitely used TurboTax since about 2008. This year I switched to H&R Block because Intuit announced that TurboTax was removing some functionality from their ""lower"" level products.  I found H&R Block's tax SW to be a GREAT PRODUCT! It was far more intuitive and very straightforward. TurboTax has been getting more and more annoying over the years with the way they dumbed down their user interface.  I also am VERY HAPPY about the built-in audit protection.
I would have given this product 5 stars but after completing our taxes I was helping my mother-in-law with hers. Because she has some retirement accounts (investments) I took the pop-up offer to upgrade to the Premium edition near the start. However I was disappointed to find that the auto-download capability only applied to half of the companies that she has. It provided the capability to recommend a company for next tax season but that doesn't help me now. I had to break down and buy TurboTax Premier for her taxes or face 3 evenings of manually entering all sorts of information.
I tried to contact the customer service chat line and both times (on the weekend) I was waiting over an hour (doing other things on another computer) and still kept receiving the message that an available representative would be with me soon.","Great, straightforward, and intuitive!"

Due to a unique tax situation (IRA recharacterization), I couldn't e-file so I cannot comment on that aspect. The paper forms worked just fine and the interview process was not a whole lot different than TurboTax. We have used this for three sets of returns this year, federal and state for each. I've used TurboTax for 20 years and switched to this mainly because I think they have turned into greedy jerks who need an attitude realignment. H&R Block did the same function with the same ease for 1/5 the cost. The only gripe might be that 2013's TurboTax did the school district return also (who knows about the 2014 version since they took much more important federal returns out to charge you more) and 2014 H&R Block did not.

I hate their ""bait and switch"" cons. 3. They kept raising their prices causing me to look elsewhere. I'm now on my third straight H&R Tax Software product because of it.

I didn't find these problems at all while using H&R block which is why I'm on my third one. The price is more reasonable and there was no pressure within the program to switch to something else. The program is very easy to use. The help section is much more user-friendly and informative. Much more so than Turbo.  My only complaint is the $20 charge for filing a state tax return after paying an extra $10 or so for the state program. I was tempted to just do a paper state return, but I guess like everyone else, who wants to mess with that!

If this is your first time doing your own taxes you might want to use other software.

It also doesn't show all the totals as conveniently as Turbotax did.  It also had some problems with auto-run on the disc, but I just went to the DVD drive and start up the installer automatically and it had no glitches.

On the other side, it's cheaper, they offer some stuff included like the free in person audit support that you pay quite handsomely for with Turbotax, though I have no experience to know if the other company's is better or not.  I had no real problem with the questions, my only little annoyances were mostly due to things being in different places or having to look a little more than with Turbotax.

  The H&R software did not load automatically via a wizard like most software, but a previous reviewer had the same problem and recommended going to directly to the disk's files and opening the appropriate "".exe"" file.  This solution worked and it loaded my previous TT info after I pointed it the proper directory.
  Overall, the H&R interview process has the same feel as TT.  I prefer the format of the TT worksheet since I think it is clearer than H&R's worksheet format.  Also TT's update schedule is more frequent.  As I remember TT would update almost weekly, however H&R will be about 3 weeks after it's last update.  I'm not sure if that's an issue, but I must wait until 12 Mar (next update) to find out.

H&R Block was not a bad alternative but these are the things I think they could do better.
  - Importing from Institutions like ETrade / TD Ameritrade.  What had happened was that I tried doing my taxes at the end of January.  When I worked on it at that time, There was no option to import trades / Dividends / Interest from Etrade or TD Ameritrade (there was actually a very limited list of Insitutions).  Anyways,  I got lazy and figured I'd do our taxes later.  Fast forward to March, H&R Block had an update that needed to be downloaded.  After the update,  Etrade / TD Ameritrade was listed as well as a whole host of other Institutions.  Etrade Import worked great!  TD Ameritrade however was listed,  but it was not able to import properly.  That was fine though since there wasn't much there and so I just did things manually.

The good news for me was that HR Block Deluxe handled all the forms I needed. I was able to upload my 2013 TurboTax return into the 2014 TurboTax Deluxe software which saved a lot of effort (however, the upload was incomplete for Form 3800, described later). The bad news is if you take itemized deductions, HR Block fails to add certain deductions automatically like TurboTax does. If you itemize, collect social security and pay Medicare B & D premiums, HR Block does not automatically add those premiums into your insurance costs and you must add them in manually (in fact, HR Block does not even ask you to enter the 1099 SSA Medicare B and D data - TurboTax does). Also, if you have a carry forward Form 3800 Business Credit, the navigation into that form is not automatic as it was in TurboTax which picks up the carry forward from the prior year's return. In addition, HR Block software rounds brokerage 1099 numbers to the nearest dollar as they are inputted, instead of waiting until all like amounts are added. This can and did result in slightly higher reported totals. TurboTax rounding takes place after each 1099 category is totaled. Another discovery I made (by testing against TurboTax OnLine versions), is that if you need to file a Form 3800 carry forward, Intuit forces you to upgrade two levels, Deluxe->Premier->Home&Business, even if you do not have any active business interests.

Being one of those affected by the change, I decided to take the opportunity to try a different solution.  I chose H&R Block Deluxe.  After completing the 2014 filings for myself, and my extended family (6 returns), I have found H&R Block Deluxe to be as easy to use, and as accurate as TurboTax.  The returns included home sales, investment sales and exchanges, IRAs and capital loss/gain calculations.  I was able to import prior year TurboTax files without issue, import investments from Ameriprise just as easy as TT, and even though the interface is different than TT, it was intuitive, and just as easy to use.  My only minor complaints are that the pre-defined list of items in the donation calculator DeductionPro product in H&R Block is not as comprehensive as the ItsDeductible product in TT, and the state product did not contain the calculation of tax penalty, you had to download a form and calculate yourself, or request the state to calculate for you.

Based on my experience this year, I will continue to use H&R Block Deluxe moving forward, unless they make a bonehead move like Intuit did this year with TurboTax.  Thank you Intuit for giving me the incentive to try another product and find that it works just as well, for less money.

My only gripe is that the only reason I opted for the Refund Bonus was because it specifically said get an Amazon e-gift card, but now finding out it's not even an available retailer. Just a word of warning for anyone else who might be interested in the bonus. Took 2 hours for me to get a hold of a customer service rep, who in the end said they don't have access to the list of retailers.

I invest at Betterment. COM, where I made two sales and once changed my stock/bond percentages. To me that was 3 transactions, but to H&R Block and the IRS it's at least sixty, maybe a hundred. The program downloads that information from Betterment -- no problem! But then it FORCES me to ""confirm"" every one of them individually. That means clicking ""edit"" next to each one that has an exclamation point (all of them -- several hundred entries) and clicking ""Next"" anywhere from two to five times, depending.

There's no effin' way I can actually CONFIRM all those details -- I have to trust Betterment. But H&R Block does not, so it will take an hour or two to do what's supposed to be ""automatic"". All of this for a total of $97 in capital gains and $5 in disallowed short sales.

In the 2013 product, after ""confirming"" each transaction, H&R Block brought me back to the top of the list, where I had to scroll down, down, down, down, down (yawn), down, down, down to find a transaction not yet ""confirmed"". This made an annoying situation even worse.

In the 2014 product, another user found that he could essentially ignore all those ! marks and he was able to e-file without ""confirming"" those transactions. I have not filed as yet, but I have successfully passed the ""error checking"" phase.

About the only negative comment that I can make is that some of the questions during the interview are a little obtuse -- I'm not sure what the answer should be.

Each year I'd order all the relevant IRS and state publications and forms, and, invariably, end up wanting to pull my hair out and/or making several revisions before being finished. It seemed like I always had a special situation that I had to research while preparing the forms. The last 2 years, I used H&R Block's DIY product and it's worked well. The cost is worth it to me for not having the headaches and not having to do the research. Plus, with the new healthcare provisions, it just makes it that much easier because I don't have to worry if I need to file yet ANOTHER form. The software just walks me through the process, even offering help and advice along the way. The free federal e-file function is really nice too.

I'm not a big fan of H&R Block as a company, but their tax software is less expensive than TurboTax, it works and saves me time. That's what's most important to me. If you use the next year's software on the same computer for consecutive years, it can even import the prior year data for you.

I didn't have any problem getting used to the way H&R collects its data.  Importing from TurboTax worked fine, but not 100% was imported.  I expected that.

I had some issues loading the H&R Block CD onto my computer, but managed to get it done.  Best I could tell, it was an H&R Block software issue.  Not my computer.  I never had that issue with TurboTax.

The one issue I see is that one needs to be very aware of the State forms/schedules that H&R supports.  I've needed WI Schedule U in the past.  H&R doesn't have it.  TurboTax at least has the form, and fills it out, even though it doesn't support e-filing it.

In short, one still needs to know something about doing Federal/State taxes to make sure the software is doing it correctly.  My preliminary findings are that TurboTax is still the better software.

So far so good.  The no-hassle packaging was nice.  My 2013 Turbo Tax information was easily imported into the H&R Block software (running on Windows 7).  the updates and state return were quick to download.  The mortgage interest deductions on H&R lacked a function I needed that TT had.  But charitable donations worked pretty much the same as TT.  It is still early in the tax season for a final judgment and I will update if I end up loving it or it turns out just ok.  So far, for the price I definitely like it.

UPDATE:  If you are confident you don't have anything unusual with your taxes I recommend H&R block.  A lot of good advice in the software. It lacks some of the bells and whistles of TurboTax (such as ongoing comparisons to your numbers from last year) but H&R Block seems worth it if you can get it at a worthwhile cost savings.

However, if you have anything in your taxes that is a bit unusual, you may want to go with TurboTax.  My taxes raised an issue that both pieces of software had difficulty handling (it requires a separate explanatory statement that I had to write.)  Both H&R Block and Turbo tax spotted this issue with their questionnaires, but it was not as easy to address the issue with H&R Block (clunky formatting, poor explanation.)  So, I ended up having to prepare the explanatory statement in Word to send to the IRS.  Not a huge issue.

44871,4,H&R Block,47.3333333333333,"01 12, 2015","My original review of HR Block Deluxe was rated by me with 2-stars. However the main reason for this low review was the program's inability to import TurboTax data. This occurred with computers running Windows XP. However, the latest updates have now fixed this problem and not only do the TurboTax data files transfer effortlessly, HR Block's program works as well as TurboTax.

As it is with other former TurboTax users, I switched to HR Block to give it a trial run. My first impressions are that it is an easy program to use, and the interface and presentation is slight different than TurboTax, it basically does the same job by taking your through a series of interview questions. The overall program seems more streamlined and data entry goes faster after you get used to the system.

And of course, HR Block as all the missing forms that were formerly left out of TT Deluxe. After doing a side-by-side comparison of the two programs, and after the initial jitters as to whether or not I would like HR Block's product, my personal conclusion is that I like HR Block and can safely say that I'll be a customer next year too, if HR Block doesn't self-destruct like Intuit did this year.

As to why I gave this program 4-stars instead of 5, this basically has to do with the slowness of HR Block addressing or even admitting that there was a problem with the importing of TurboTax data. The HR Block forums finally did address the issue and notified its customers that a fix was on the way, but it took way too long to quell the concerns of customers who recently switched to its software.

Customer service reps didn't have a clue to what was happening with this bug, and most of the time didn't even realize there was a problem. All they basically said was, ""Gee, we're sorry. But call tech support for help."" This didn't do any good as these guys just said to reinstall the software, which didn't work of course.

But in-spite of all the bumps in the road, HR Block Deluxe came through and proved itself to be a worthy opponent to Intuit's product.

I had to read the directions to install it but it works fine and the format was just different than I'm used to. After a year or two I'm sure it will seem like second nature.

The program looked up last year's return (also filed with the HRB software) and plugged in a number for the AGI that was wrong. But it would not let me correct it -- the field containing the (erroneous) AGI was locked.

In order to efile, I had to go an alternative route (which did happen through the HRB software) to get two efile PINs (one for me, one for my wife) from the IRS online and use those to efile.

That did work and I did efile, but it was frustrating and time-consuming to have to work around HRB's bug.

Previously, I needed two packages: one for my regular taxes, with income and schedule D; and the business one for a trust. Lots of $$$.
I checked out this H&R product, finding out that it would allow me to do BOTH types of tax forms for probably 1/3rd the cost of the other brand. That was the good part.
I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because it was somewhat harder to figure out what to do in some situations with the business software, having to go back to last year's tax forms to see what the other program did. And it kept coming up with two issues that needed to be resolved (supposedly) before finishing. My accountant brother-in-law couldn't see anything wrong with what I had, and later told me that another friend of his had the same issue and said that it was just a quirk. But it caused me quite a bit more time to complete and more stress than the other company's software.

Both programs were included in one product disk with H&R.  TurboTax requires 2 products at 3X the cost.  H&R included a PDF printer that works great on my Windows PC for tax forms and any other printout want to save.  This is a nice bonus software, I used for things I would normally print but don't really need hardcopy.

Why only 4 stars.  This software doesn't provide the level of confidence that TurboTax provides.  The audit/review section seems OK, but it doesn't appear to be really looking hard.  I doesn't remember warnings you clicked as OK.  For example I get a W2 from an annuity with no Social Security taxes..this is normal, but it gave a warning that it might be an error on every line that was blank or zero.  That's OK, but let me clear the error and don't show it again.  It didn't handle multiple 1095-A forms in the earlier versions.  This was fixed in March.

Since I do my taxes every year using the same forms, I looked over the results and don't see any issues.  If I didn't need both the 1120S and 1040 programs, I would have stayed with TurboTax.

Approach to filling out the forms differed somewhat from prior experience, but very logical, complete and basically easy to use.  Needed clarification on two issues -- and got excellent support from the online support group.

Second, The Business (Federal & CA) has several options for type of business; I used the Partnership software.  As I imagine this to be a smaller market, it was not so robustly designed and left a number of questions ""unanswered"" about exactly what to fill-in on some questions (Fed documents were not much clearer), but with some perseverance, was able to file both by printing/mailing the returns to both Federal & CA.

45011,4,H&R Block,54.99,"03 16, 2015","With TurboTax being more expensive for less, I opted for H&R Block's version of a tax-season bandage. It always seems easier to use the software than it is to actually read through the forms and try to make sense of the dense legalese and governmental twists that constitute the April 15 dance. Block's version of the bandage seems less showy than TurboTax's efforts, provides a means to get into the forms when needed, navigates fairly easily and allows me to go back easily enough and add information as I dig through the shoebox of receipts and forms that seem to grow yearly. The dance usually took a half hour or so with TT and it took about the same amount of time with Block. Given everything, this was cheaper, just as quick and was pretty clear throughout the program as to what I needed to do in order to make the pain go away.

Quick, that is, once I downloaded the entire, updated version of the program from H&R Block, which isn't what I bought here. Unable to update, I had to go online with Block's ""chat with a live person"" who came on after about 30 minutes, asked me if I did all the things they tell you to do online under FAQs which I had done multiple times and finally sent me a link to the newest version which worked wonderfully fast with no hiccups and none of the nonsense of having to spend time updating something that should be sold updated. Theirs, I thought, was a smart solution to the problem. It helped that I wrote out the problem as I was waiting to ""talk"" to someone because on a Sunday afternoon in March, I imagine I was one of many others trying to do the tax shuffle. Overall, the customer service was as fast as I could expect, they sent me a copy of the chat instantly to my email because I was lost to them (and they to me) when I restarted my Mac, and the solution worked the first time. I appreciate that they weren't trying to teach me how to do a head spin after a three-point twisting somersault, but stuck to a simple two-step so I wasn't frustrated further. In the end, they didn't waste more of my time.

I was able to import my TT return of the past with no problem and except for a few times when I didn't quite understand what was being asked of me and the ""help"" section wasn't particularly helpful-- I'm also doing my father's final return-- I would say that this is worked out just fine. Even sometimes in TT I would find myself on the IRS or state sites looking for answers, so I guess this isn't any worse than past year's. TT's interview process takes longer, but seems to be very thorough; Block presents a checklist and if you are navigating a new area, it is a bit less helpful. With TT, they ask qualifying questions that help you understand why something does or doesn't fit your particular situation. Sometimes I'd go through one of those ""hopeful"" loops without gaining any ground, so maybe the more streamlined checklist is better in the end.

Block also offers a 5-10% incentive if you buy gift ecards with your refund. It kind of makes the pain less painful. I haven't filed yet, so we'll see how streamlined and simple that part of it is. I expect it to go pretty smoothly which is the best way of dealing with taxes-- smooth and simple.",navigates fairly easily and allows me to go back easily enough and ...

So, for a bag of clothes, you have to remember each item in each bag.

I prefer this this year over the competition is all.  Turbo Tax is the product I used the past few years.  Prior to that, I had used H&R Block software.  But, having a huge issue with our state occur because of a fail in the state software one year, we went with Turbo Tax.  This year, however, Turbo Tax was ludicrously expensive to get a product with Schedule C support included.

So, we decided to go back to H&R Block software.  Whatever state issues they had appear resolved.

By the way, the issue we had was we didn't get all of our money the state owed us.  An error of any sort is unacceptable when everything had been entered we could in the Premium software and state.

So far I am very happy with their software. I completed my Federal and state return with ease. The funny part was that HR block uploaded my information from last year's TTax file.

It imported Turbo information EASILY, and was just as intuitive as Turbo Tax, was just as easy.  The only thing I noticed differently was that I almost missed my Excise Tax {car registration) going through the steps?  Not sure why it skipped over this, and I only caught it speaking with my significant other.  Makes me a little concerned I may have missed some other tax savings, but overall I think it is a great software, just may need to make a mental note next year to check the big tax deductions going through all the steps.  Sorry Turbo Tax your response to bring back loyal customers was way late and not sincere, H&R Block for me for my 2015  taxes.  As for H&R Block customer service, I had an issue having my taxes electronically accepted by the IRS, I called H&R Block and a young lady helped me double check some entries, and after discovering the mistake I successfully submitted my taxes.  It was NICE TO TALK TO A HUMAN at H&R Block, that was a HUGE plus not to struggle for 15 minutes with the automated screening of typical customer service from companies.  If anyone can relate to the frustration of just trying to contact someone human to answer a non-standard question, you will appreciate H&R Block's customer service.","It imported Turbo information EASILY, and was just as intuitive as Turbo Tax"

This will cost you an additional $34.95 PLUS TAX. There is NO DISCOUNT. Turbo tax charges the same. They have been increasing the price for the second state module each year and it now costs the same (or more - since it is not discounted) than the Federal + State software.
Just be prepared.

45042,4,H&R Block,54.99,"01 28, 2015","I got the Premium software in a package with Premium + Business software. This review applies only to the Premium edition.

It installed easily and updated quickly. My only complaint is the nag screen that comes up every time I load it, asking if I want to see the Read Me file. (No, I don't!) The software immediately found my last year's returns, despite the fact that they were done by TurboTax, instantly going to the TTax folder and showing all five returns. (I am the default tax guy for my entire family.) Even better, almost all the data was promptly inhaled. I regard this as quite a feat, given that these companies must do their best to prevent rivals from poaching their customers.

I have no complaints with the bulk of my various schedules and forms, of which there are quite a few. The software doesn't strike me as being quite up to the standard of TTax, though it gets the job done. It's just a bit, well, LUMPY. Perhaps that's only because I am so familiar with the TTax interface, having used it for about twenty years.

But here's the problem: Schedule C! I switched to Block because TTax hugely increased the cost of the edition that would handle this schedule. The Block Premium did inhale all my depreciation schedules, which was a huge relief, but it failed to import the list of 1099-MISC forms that I had received in the course of my business. This is important because the IRS now specifically asks about these forms. Well, there are only about a dozen of them, so it didn't seem to be a huge chore to re-create them.

Now, I always work with the forms, not with the stupid interview that both TTax and Block provide. But it proved impossible to enter this business income on the form. (Well, it could be done by using a scratch pad, adding up the total, and entering it on the appropriate line as an over-ride. But that, I figure, would be a red flag to the IRS.)  So for each 1099-MISC I have to go to the interview, page through the Income questions, and create a new 1099 form. This is very annoying.

So I can't recommend this software for Schedule C preparers (unless of course your income is all cash!). I'm sticking with Block because I prefer to waste time than to waste money. Next year, however, if TTax walks back its stupid pricing policy, I will be returning to what I believe is the better software. As I understand it, you can now get Schedule C (and schedules B, D, and E) on Turbotax Deluxe. If so, that I think is a better buy than Block Premium.",Not a good choice for Schedule C preparers

I have used their software for the past 10 years and have been pleased with how they break up the parts so you are not so overwhelmed. This is the 3rd year I have had to purchase the Premium level since I am a land lord, so the cost is a little high, but I can claim it on my taxes...

Maybe the customer should have more of a choice of what and how to review the data imported.
It seems the software writers are beginning to assume the tax payer knows what they are doing and are skipping some basic questions/steps that drew me to use the software in the past.  The software needs to be kept simple and maybe a beta test using someone without tax knowledge and someone with just enough tax knowledge to be dangerous would work.  The person(s) selected should be new every year.

This software was very similar.  It walks you through all the sections, such as income, deductions and special situations.  It is less touchy feely than TT.  It is very straight forward and to the point.  The user interface is more simplistic and a touch less conversational but in the end it functioned just fine.  The one thing to be careful of is QTP/529 plan income.  Ideally a program would ask you your 529 withdrawals and college expenses to determine if you withdrew more than you spent, hence have to pay tax.  Instead the program asks you for the taxable amount on your 1099Q.  The key word here being taxable, which you need to calculate on your own.  So while a portion of my withdrawal is income, it is not taxable since my qualified expenses were higher than the amount withdrawn.  If I entered the income amount, my total tax went up, which it shouldn't.  So I left it blank.  Looking at the IRS forms directly, there is no worksheet.

45138,4,H&R Block,27.9333333333333,"02 16, 2015","Switched from TurboTax, thankfully, this year. I just read about the security breach TurboTax  had, and I'm really happy to have switched for 2014. I switched because of the reviews I read about the changes in forms offered by TurboTax. I think they should lose business for their bad, greedy decision. I actually didn't need the forms, but on principle decided to look elsewhere for tax software, I read some articles online where people prepared the same return using different software. Basically, my biggest concern was with the refund. Everything I read indicated the refund was the same with H&R and Turbo. H&R was cheaper, so I thought it was worth a try, thinking I can go back to Turbo next year if I'm not happy.

The download was quick and easy. I'm adult who has been filing my own taxes for nearly 20 years, and I've handled payroll taxes for nearly 15 years. So, I'm experienced, but still think this would be easy and quick for most people to use. The H&R software imported last year's TurboTax return, and my W2, and everything went smoothly. I prepared my return in no time. My taxes are fairly simple. No big changes in my life. I have a mortgage. I have health insurance through my employer. I have a few donations to claim. I've used TurboTax for over 5 years.  Before that I did the free filing over the internet with H&R Block. I wasn't happy with the free version of H&R, so that's why I'd been using TurboTax, and it worked, so didn't see a reason to change until this year.

I'll be using this to file for my parents this year. My father  passed away just before Christmas, so I wasn't sure if I'd be comfortable trying to deal with the tax ramifications. I considered advising my mother to use a professional since my individual income knowledge is less than my other tax knowledge. However, after using the software for my own taxes, and following up with some research on filing for a deceased person, I feel confident in doing theirs. Also, I've known quite a few people who prepare individual taxes this time of year to earn extra money, and I wouldn't trust them anywhere near my taxes. It's so busy this time of year, a lot these places just try to get warm bodies in a chair. They don't know nearly as much  as you would expect and are just keying the info you can do yourself.",Switched from TurboTax- Thankfully!

I found the H&R Block Tax Software Deluxe + State to be similar to TurboTax, enough so that it was easy to navigate, with only a few exceptions.  The font size of the instructions, questions, forms, etc., was a little small for me, and I do wish there had been an option to increase the text size to make them more easily readable.  When instructed to ""go to"" a link or tool (which was in the tool bar location), I had to deduce that, and due to the smaller font/text/icon size, it took me a little time to see the icon in order to proceed.  Having done that, the program easily proceeded as directed/expected.  The final negative for me was that at almost the end of the exercise of completing my tax return, I was asked if I wanted to apply any refunds due me to some cards.  I have no problem with that, and you can choose to do so or not, but the link to choose not to have a refund go towards ""gift"" cards, was so light green that I barely could see it in order to choose that option and to proceed to e-file my return.  In summary, I will say that I would appreciate the option of increasing font/icon sizes, and also the (H&R Block) green color for links in the program was very light, and whether intentional or not, that made it difficult and time consuming to actually see the link in order to opt out from purchasing more H&R Block product.

They also ""ask"" you to pay $20 to upgrade to a higher version (with additional business / investment features) even though the ""form"" I was filing for my daughter-in-law had no investment involved (should have been a 1040EZ form, but she wanted the e-filing).

I was not surprised but it was nonetheless upsetting.  So, I tried H&R Block.  I, personally,  found it far superior to TurboTax.  For the past two years, my return was subject to a bug in TurboTax which resulted in interest income from a note which I held being reported twice.  The first year, I contacted their tech support.  They were unable to talk me through correcting the mistake and ended up sending my problem up the support ladder.  The higher ups ""fixed"" the problem by going in from their side and changing my data outside the software.  Last year, it appeared the error had been fixed.  After I transmitted my return electronically, I reviewed the paper copy and found the duplicate entry and the resulting tax overpayment were still there somehow, even though it did not show up in the preparation process.  Apparently, the entry got imported from our 2013 return but did not show up on screen for me to delete.  It was, however, included in the e-file. That meant I had to file an amended return to get the rest of my refund.

Even with TurboTax's convoluted rebate scheme, this software was far less expensive and included all the forms which Intuit held for ransom.

H&RBlock Deluxe has a very clean look without all the cartoon stuff that covers TurboTax.  It is easy to use, far simpler than TurboTax.  It seems to be more accurate, at least with regard to my particular anomaly.  The forms are far more easy to edit if you prefer.  I am a convert.

I normally use TurboTax, but because if the issues with the hidden fees with this year's software purchase I decided to buy the download version of H&R Block, a direct 1-to-1 equivalent for whatever TurboTax version you normally use. The software functions very much like TurboTax, so for users of TurboTax, the experience is very much the same. It's obviously got a different GUI and a different flow within seconds, but it's still very familiar. It starts with income section, goes into deductions, does an error check, then finalizes and files. Really, the only reason I didn't give the software 5 stars is because I didn't feel that the ""further explanations,"" when needed, weren't as thorough as I would have liked. Usually, when I need a question about an item answered on TurboTax I get a pretty solid explanation. I got good answers on H&R Block, but I there were a couple of items where I went to the IRS online to ensure I had the full and correct answer. Perhaps with another sentence or two, the explanations I double-checked wouldn't have needed to be checked at all. Otherwise, for former TurboTax users, this is a great option. H&R Block does everything TurboTax does without hidden fees. Your Federal e-File is free, and your State e-File is $20 ($19.95 technically), though obviously your State return is included in the purchase of the software. If you're like me and looking for a tax software to replace TurboTax because of their fees, H&R Block is a very good option. You can even import your TurboTax file from last year to ensure all your data is the same, including importing income forms like W-2s from your employer's service.

For reasons unclear to me, H&R's program wasn't able to utilize last year's Turbo Tax detail to populate this year's program, but frankly, feeding the H&R program with the needed info wasn't that big a deal and didn't make much difference time-wise.

The most important thing I can say about the H&R program is that it is a bit less intuitive than Turbo Tax was, at least for dummies like me, but with a little help over my shoulder, I was able to get my fed return e-filed.  I ran into a bit of trouble with e-filing for California (and the explanation H&R offered wasn't clear) so I'll simply file the CA return old fashioned way (mail) and no worries.

One other thing: don't wait till the last weekend to switch if you're tax-return challenged, as I am, and expect H&R's online or phone support to be able to respond rapidly.

I gave Turbo Tax plenty of money and support over the years -- and I like to think of myself as a loyal customer, but Turbo Tax should have put a loyalty/return-user program into place a long time ago to show appreciation and respect for its customers.

45308,4,H&R Block,27.9333333333333,"04 12, 2015","I was an early adopter of tax software back in the '90s - it was a natural progression, since at the time, my taxes were simple and the early, terrible software was good enough for my needs. As my taxes have grown more complicated over the years, the software has also become more sophisticated and streamlined, providing me a sense that it is keeping pace with my needs and making my life easier. That said, it is all still complicated enough that I just want to get it done as quickly as possible without ending up in a quagmire - so, I have stuck with TurboTax for year after year, thinking that the extra cost was worth avoiding the potential hassles of switching software.

After reading the TurboTax reviews this year and seeing how awful the experience has been for so many users, I finally had the motivation to try H&R Block, which seems to be the top contender. The switch started with a pleasant surprise - I had been using TurboTax Premier to handle my straightforward investments, but H&R Block Deluxe could handle what I owned - nice, since Deluxe is cheaper. In fact, at the time of purchase, H&R Block Deluxe was less than half the cost of TurboTax Premier! I was slightly worried that H&R Block Deluxe wouldn't have everything I needed since it is difficult to find a comprehensive list of the features covered by each version, but I just finished my taxes and there was no need for concern.

The experience: very similar to TurboTax. Lots of questions, straightforward to answer in most cases, direct import of my previous TurboTax return file, direct import of info from major investment firms, etc. The same cons: extraneous questions about whether I want to purchase this and that, hire a tax consultant, etc. - in short, the same nonsense that TurboTax includes, no more or less than they do. This is the only reason this review wasn't 5 stars - but TurboTax wouldn't have earned 5 stars, either, since they both waste my time having to click through these extra screens. Not something I particularly like from software that I've purchased - there should be a single question at the beginning about whether extraneous offers should be skipped or not, which is something I would find acceptable enough to earn that last star.

The conclusion: I wish TurboTax had messed up their customer relations years ago, because I would have saved $20-30 per year for all the years I've been using TurboTax. Next year I'll be reaching for H&R Block again, assuming they don't make the same mistake or jack up their prices.",Finally switched and pleasantly surprised

I really wished that the software had been written from the respect of a layman who is struggling to understand the subtleties of the tax laws. I struggled and got through with the software.

45330,4,H&R Block,27.9333333333333,"04 7, 2015","Its my 4th year using H&R Block tax software.  The download and installation from Amazon.com was quick and efficient.  It accessed my last year's return with no problems to complete basic information.  Step by step instructions were well explained and allowed an easy completion of my return.  This was much appreciated as this year's return had a rather uncommon issue (for me) that I never had experienced.  No problems.

Compared to Turbo Tax it is less costly.  I have used Turbo Tax in the past and have found both Turbo Tax and H&R Block to be very similar in terms of being able to handle my returns in a complete and efficient manner with no issues.  The lower price of H&R Block made the decision to go with them very easy.

One issue and complaint that I do have with H&R Block was the very high price it charged to add on a state return ($40) if you did not purchase a software package that initially included a state return.  A late W-2 from earnings (8 Years Ago!) attributed to a state I no longer live in surprised me after I had already purchased the software.  Rather than purchase an addition state for $40 I found it cheaper to buy another complete H&R Block software package from Amazon that included a state return for $20.  The pricing policies being practiced by both Turbo Tax and H&R Block seemed to determined more by greed than commonsense.  As usual, Amazon.com is the best place to purchase!!

This year I also tried the On-Line Tax Act to see how it compared.  It had some issues with utilizing information from my last year's H&R Block return.  Not a big problem, but, it did require a bit of proofreading and correcting basic information.  I found the information in Tax Act to be more complete, but, perhaps a bit more technical and complicated than is necessary.  It did not handle one issue with a rather uncommon stock option trade without some tinkering.  H&R Block was much easier to use.  Overall, I found H&R Block to be a better product for me.",H&R Block is My preferred Tax Software - Excellent product - Best Overall Pricing

I've been using the other company for a decade or more.  I was happy that this product was much cheaper.

My first impressions was this product is not quite as intuitive, the user interface isn't as slick, but it did the job.  I had to call support to find one form that I couldn't find.  But I successfully filed my taxes.

Note, that I have a home-based business and a number of special situations that make my taxes a bit more complicated than most other people.  Because it is a small business, and there's not a lot of complicated accounting work, the Deluxe version worked fine for me.  It led me through all the necessary questions.

I was able to get a great refund (your mileage will vary), better than last year using the other product - but my tax situation is unique, year to year, so in all honesty, it's difficult to compare.  Ultimately, however, I was happy with the product, and I'll likely use it again next year.  I give it 4 stars out of 5 because usability could be improved.

Was much cheaper to start to purchase the program, and was delighted it imported my Turbo Tax file from last year, just like TT would have if I was using it.  Figured my simple taxes easily with the program, and got a rebate that made my Norton super cheap for the next year as well.  It did not do an adequate job with my daughter's taxes, however.

Learned that the software for the state did not find an item that was not liable for taxes and we would have paid almost a thousand dollars more if we went with what H&R Tax Software determined she owed.  It may be that anyone should go to a preparer rather than do it yourself if you have a slightly more than simple tax situation though.  It was cheaper to go to the preparer for her than it would have been to buy Turbo Tax.  And only 15 dollars more than H&R.

I was pleasantly surprised at how easy the transition was from using Turbo Tax to H&R Block.  While it did not seem to be as intuitive, the overall process was painless.  I did note that the Direct Download for one of my statement was not available requiring me to manually input the numbers, but everything else was seamless and smooth.  Plus there does not seem to be much to filing taxes anymore as the IRS increases your Standardized Deduction each year to the point that all you have to do is fill out a form, sign the form and send a check.

After contacting H & R Block via social media (Facebook) I got a response. I was not happy with what HRB was offering for a response from their tech support (time and effort) so I contacted my system security tech support (ESET). They were great!!
First solution: Completely uninstall ESET System Security 8 and attempt updates and registration. IT WORKED! I got no certificate or system clock errors and was able to download the state program with no problem. I re-installed ESET and the HRB software is working fine so far. I have not tried to efile yet....

After a second email to ESET to achieve a permanent solution, they sent a link to illustrate how to add a firewall exception to their software. This allows a .exe file/program to function through the firewall. This link is below:
http://kb.eset.com/zap/SOLN2843

My only question to them now is why would a firewall exception be needed if, before, I completely turned off the firewall temporarily and it still didn't work???
I still maintain that HRB needs to modify their software to work within a Kaspersky or ESET environment! But then, I am stubborn that way.
Good luck fellow tax filers...and when you get to the healthcare section of the software...well, prepare yourself.
I will change my review from 1 star to 4 stars because, quite frankly the program is not bad to use.

UPDATE:
STILL NOT WORKING!! 3.28.15
I tried everything from removing my CMOS battery to resetting BIOS, turning off all system security, uninstalling browsers and removing security certificates, changing network and proxy settings, updated software, uninstall...reinstall... etc, etc....
I cannot activate the software, which, in turn does not allow me to efile federal AND cannot download the state version, even though I paid extra for it.
Internet searching has revealed no solution other than upset users who are getting no response from H&R Block.

First Post:
This review is for the download version. I am having problems registering:
""SSL Error: bad server certificate or incorrect PC date. Please check the date set on your computer.""
Upon clicking OK...:
""We are not able to process your registration at this time (error code 20). If the problem persists, please register later.""
OK, that's fine, I can still use the program.
However, when e-filing federal, AND trying to file state, I get the same error.
After visiting H & R web site and web searching for a fix, I have determined it is a bug that exists in which Amazon needs to update a possible ""fixed"" version on their download server...if that is how it works.
I have tried all the ""turn off firewall, turn off virus protection, make sure proxy server is not on.......etc, etc.""

Intuit admits the error of their ways, but it's too late.  I was pleasantly surprised and absent unforeseen changes will never go back to TurboTax.  The H&RB software is cheaper than TurboTax; it boots up 5 times faster; it opens a file 4 times faster; it has no shiny graphics to slow down the process or take up space on the hard drive (H&R is 2/3 the size of TurboTax); its update mechanism is far more efficient than TurboTax and totally transparent from a scheduling perspective; it is accurate and produces the forms flawlessly.  It also performs an e-file flawlessly.  The only con I can see is that it does not have a form which duplicates TurboTax's ""What-If"" form.  I would imagine that 99% of the users don't even use that form to forecast the next year or experiment with different elections in any year, but if you do use it, it's not there.  However, there is a workaround.  You can simply copy your return to a new file with a new name and play with it as if it was the next year.  All you have to do is manually change the exemption allowance and the standard deduction (if you use it to forecast a year other than the current year).  Both override changes are quick and easy.

There was one very frustrating issue with the filing process this year. Specifically, HR Block rather aggressively pushed its H&R Block Refund Bonus offer for refunds to be issues as electronic gift cards, but the e-card option seemed to block the US savings bond purchase option. Two changes are needed for the 2015 software program:

1Please be equally proactive in making it clear how to allocate part of a tax refund to purchase US Savings Bonds. The bond option didn't seem to be explicitly offered as I went through the menu driven software steps. Only after some extra detective work did I finally figure out how to manually hunt down the IRS Form 8888 form, and complete it to make the bond purchase. A well designed tax software program would have made the bond purchase option explicit as one of the menu driven steps.

2The ultimate nightmare this year was trying to figure out how to set up a 3-way allocation of my tax refund to a US Savings Bonds purchase, an electronic gift card purchase, and the remainder to a personal bank account. I tried multiple times for nearly an hour to accomplish that three part allocation, but each time, the software thwarted by attempt.  Finally, to get the filing completed, I cancelled the e-card allocation and went with all of the refund going to just the bank account and the bonds. For 2015, please add an explicit software menu step that makes it completely user friendly to allocate a refund to all three options of the e-cards, the US bonds, and a bank deposit (with the understanding that the Form 8888 will appear for the bond purchase after one has made the initial refund allocation via a user friendly menu).","Progress made in 2014, more progress needed for 2015"

It's endlessly frustrating that the tax preparation industry manages to keep our tax system convoluted so that they stay in business, but let's save that for another day.  Like many others, I switched from TurboTax to H&R Block after the recent TT product change.  Some thoughts:

Pros:
1 - It does everything that TurboTax Deluxe does, at a significant discount (the lower cost earns it the 4th star... otherwise it would've gotten 3)
2 - It's a good way to double check numbers for those of us who still read through all the tax form instructions

Cons:
1 - Frankly, if you are used to filing your own taxes ""by hand"", this software (or TurboTax) does not necessarily make your filing easier.  There's a lot of data entry, such as names and IDs of institutions issuing you tax forms, that the tax forms don't require but the program makes you type out.  Not many of my W2's and 1099s are available for import electronically, so this step is considerably time consuming.
2 - Similar to the above, it also does not produce any bigger refund for people who know what they are doing

Other Thoughts:
1 - I really, really despise the ""get your billions back, America"" commercial with the sickening green bow tie.  It gives the False pretense that H&R Block will help you get a larger tax refund than you otherwise deserve.  Of course it doesn't do that (wouldn't be legal), and quite unfortunately I am in a situation of owing more taxes.

1) I'm pretty sure it's the same exact software H&R Block professionals use in the office. As a result, it's a little more feature-rich than is really necessary to get the job done. For instance, there are hidden keyboard shortcuts that pop up all sorts of strange dialogs with jargony prompts.
2) It doesn't import information (from W-2, for instance) as readily as TurboTax. I'd say this is more the ""PC"" of tax software, where TurboTax is the ""Mac"".

I didn't have any problems installing or using the software and there were no surprises.

I was a bit disappointment that a summary/cover sheet did not print with the return and missed the effective tax rate that Turbo Tax would calculate.

I just filed, the money is not in the bank and I don't know for certain that the IRS will not be pounding on my door in the middle of the night but other than all that I'm pleased with how things went.",A-OK - I miss the Turbo Tax summaries with effective tax rate.
45538,4,H&R Block,27.9333333333333,"02 12, 2015","Unlike those who were sick of TurboTax's removing the necessary forms and increasing the price, I ran into a different problem. i have used TaxAct for years, and it was really great, worked fine and was very inexpensive. So, what did they decide to do? Made it impossible to use with Windows XP, despite millions of us still using it.

I emailed them describing the problem, and they wrote back, saying essential, ""tough."" So I called and got a refund. Really a shame.

So, after reading reviews of TurboTax, about the only downloadable one that seemed good was H&RB. It downloaded and installed just fine, but as I expected, could not import the files from TaxAct. Even so, it was not that difficult to enter everything all over again.

The questions were very easy to follow, and when I got to entering my tax-free muni bond dividends, it was much easier than TaxAct. It had just one box to check that they were tax free and it worked perfectly. It calculated instantly the part of Social Security that was taxable, filled out Schedule B and C, and did the same with my state forms. It took me through the subtractions that my state permits.

So, everything worked very well for me, except:

1. Every time I shut it down and reopened by clicking the desktop icon, it was right at the beginning, even though I saved it frequently. Unlike TaxAct that immediately asks if you want to go to the last page filled out, I could find no way at all to do this, except to check the section I was on, and then page through until I found where I left off. This was so annoying that I spent the rest of the day finishing it all up.

2. I could not find any way to get to Help Contacts, either by phone, chat or email. I clicked on Help, and got pages and pages of FAQs and other stuff, but even clicking on various tabs that should take me there, nothing worked except them wanting me to Search for what I wanted help with. I tried that with every single phrase of what I wanted, but nothing found. TaxAct made it very simple to call or chat, and never with more than a few minutes wait.

3.  I have always e-filed the federal and printed and paid what I owed on the state forms. I planned to do the same with H&RB, but instead of just letting the user create a five-digit PIN, it had the most ridiculous and complex setup to do this. I had to fill out a long form, and eventually came to my PIN. Even though it was a joint return, I never could find out how to get the PIN for my wife. I even started all over again with same result. It is not part of the program, but takes you to an IRS site, and as one might expect from a government site, it is pure drudge. So, I gave up and printed out the federal and state forms, and will send checks for what I owed. If I had a refund coming, this would really be annoying, and reason enough not to use it again.

These three problems should be enough to make it a two or three-star, but I have to admit, that actually doing the interviews was really very easy. Almost fun.

After it was all done, I decided to find their phone number, and placed a call. No way to indicate I was already a customer, so waited on hold for 30 minutes, and then gave up in disgust.","What works well is excellent, but three flaws that are really annoying"

The biggest challenge was to get used to the different GUI layout, versus that of TurboTax.  Because of all the justifiable negative press about TurboTax,  I switched to HRB for first time for tax year 2014.

At least H&R didn't pull the stupid stunt and screw all their customers like TT did this year.  And for some reason, lots of TT users are ending up reporting tax fraud for returns already filed by other people.  Hmmmm.....

I made the switch from TT to H&R years ago when TT got too big for their britches and started charging more money for the equivalent product.  Each product has its plusses and minuses but H&R works fine for me and I file Schedule E, multiple Schedule C's, Form 8something for Home Office use, lots of assets to depreciate and H&R has never had a problem. I can go straight to the form if needed. I was able to use it when a business that I had stock in sold and I had to enter K-1 forms for multiple years (and write big checks for capital gains)

I read through the extensive list of Q&A on Amazon before buying and became amazed at all the repeat questions for people who apparently don't know how to put a little effort to see if their question has already been asked.

To answer what I saw as the most repeated questions, H&R Deluxe plus State does or does not:

Does allow 5 free federal online filings
Does allow one (1) free state to be downloaded
Does allow the state to be filed online at a cost of $19.95 each (Nowhere does it say the state filing is free)
Does allow you to purchase additional states at some cost
Does include Schedules C, D, E, F etc.
Does include the form for use of a home office
Does do depreciation of assets
Does handle K1's and sale of a small business with the associated capital gains

From all my research from this year and years previous, the Premium version doesn't add any actual forms or capability, just tools to help guide the user for advanced forms such as Schedule C.  If you need a form that this software doesn't have then you probably need to go to a CPA anyway.

I give only 4 stars because there are always some little features I don't like. For instance, when you create a list of items for a particular field, the list is tied to that field but opening the list after it is created makes you scroll through all the lists which is cumbersome.  This should be an easy fix they could so.  Also, some of the included tax help is pretty generic and I end up going to the IRS web site and getting the forms or pamphlets to read more in depth about what certain fields are looking for and what is or is not allowable.

I went with the H&R Block Deluxe version, which was less than half the price of the corresponding TurboTax version.
It suited me fine.  I have investments (Schedule A, Schedule D); self-employment income (Schedule C), and a lot of charitable donations.  The H&R Block Deluxe version handled it all easily.
I liked the TurboTax interface a little better, but that may have been because I had used it the prior 10 years.
I also believe the TurboTax help is better;  I tried searching the H&R Block help to see what to do about a 1099SA I received; it was not helpful, whereas I found great help on the TurboTax web site!
Some of the 'audit checks' were a bit annoying - kept telling me I had something marked tentative, but it was a mystery, I could never find it, it pointed to a sheet without the data it highlighted on it.  So that was a little annoying but I just ignored it.
This product is good enough.  There was no drama, I felt like I got what I paid for, I can't see paying the extra $20 for TurboTax Deluxe - or the extra $40 for TurboTax Premier, which Intuit sneakily forced me into because of capital gains.

It's OK though as TurboTax was going to charge me $30 extra. H&R charges $15 to E-file but if you print it out it's free. The online version of TurboTax you have no choice and have to E-file and pay the charge. If you don't need the extra forms such as D then the basic is all you need.

45574,4,H&R Block,27.9333333333333,"01 24, 2015","I'm another convert from TurboTax because of Intuit's foolhardy decision to get rid of Schedules C, D, and E from this year's Deluxe version, which is the version I had been using in the past. For my tax situation, I would have needed TurboTax Premier this year, for a whopping $80 (purchased for $50 then promptly returned + $30 extortion fee from Intuit to upgrade). H&R Block's Deluxe + State cost me only $35 on sale at a local office supply store. That's less than half the price of what it would have cost me to use the correct version of TT. But I now see that the huge backlash against TT has caused Intuit to cut their prices drastically. As of today, the Premier version of TT costs $54, which is a lot better than the $80 I would have had to pay, but still more than Block Deluxe.

I disagree with some comments saying that the interview process is unfriendly or that the interface is ugly. I see both TT and this software as comparable in terms of their interviews and user interfaces. Others have given one star because they complained about deceptive advertising due to the $20 fee to e-file one state return. The product comparison pop-up, which is a photo of the back of this product's box, clearly states that it costs $19.95 to e-file a state return. That is not False advertising. People should not be giving unfavorable reviews just because they didn't read carefully. They should be rating the product, not their reading ability. Anyway, even with the $20 state e-filing fee, that's still a heck of a lot cheaper than TT Premier, which still charges you $19.99 for state e-filing. E-filing state returns is never free with these products.

There are two reasons I'm rating this four stars:
1. Installation difficulty - Trying to install the CD version on my Windows 8 laptop, I kept getting a ""software didn't install correctly"" message. Very frustrating. I finally found other reviews on Amazon (thanks, Amazon, since I couldn't even find anything about this on the H&R Block site) that fixed the problem. Right-click on the installation file name on the CD drive, click on Properties, click on the Compatibility tab, and choose Windows 7 (or any other option that works for you). I've also read about people not being able to import last year's TurboTax return on a Windows XP computer. I've contacted H&R Block to ask them to post fixes for these problems right on their home page, instead of burying them deep in their Customer Support section, which people won't be able to find easily. From the comments here, it seems like the downloaded version is having more problems than the CD version. I would recommend the CD version.
2. 1099 downloads - One thing I liked about TurboTax was the large number of financial institutions from which W-2 and 1099 forms could be downloaded. H&R Block's list is a little smaller. Of the two I need, Block has Vanguard, but not E-Trade. Here is a comparison of TT and Block on this score: http://thefinancebuff.com/import-w2-and-1099-forms-into-turbotax-and-hr-block-from-where.html.

I read the interview process questions pretty closely and found them to be much like those in TurboTax. So, overall the process went quite smoothly, although I haven't yet filed.

45585,4,H&R Block,27.9333333333333,"01 12, 2015","My original review of HR Block Deluxe was rated by me with 2-stars. However the main reason for this low review was the program's inability to import TurboTax data. This occurred with computers running Windows XP. However, the latest updates have now fixed this problem and not only do the TurboTax data files transfer effortlessly, HR Block's program works as well as TurboTax.

As it is with other former TurboTax users, I switched to HR Block to give it a trial run. My first impressions are that it is an easy program to use, and the interface and presentation is slight different than TurboTax, it basically does the same job by taking your through a series of interview questions. The overall program seems more streamlined and data entry goes faster after you get used to the system.

And of course, HR Block as all the missing forms that were formerly left out of TT Deluxe. After doing a side-by-side comparison of the two programs, and after the initial jitters as to whether or not I would like HR Block's product, my personal conclusion is that I like HR Block and can safely say that I'll be a customer next year too, if HR Block doesn't self-destruct like Intuit did this year.

As to why I gave this program 4-stars instead of 5, this basically has to do with the slowness of HR Block addressing or even admitting that there was a problem with the importing of TurboTax data. The HR Block forums finally did address the issue and notified its customers that a fix was on the way, but it took way too long to quell the concerns of customers who recently switched to its software.

Customer service reps didn't have a clue to what was happening with this bug, and most of the time didn't even realize there was a problem. All they basically said was, ""Gee, we're sorry. But call tech support for help."" This didn't do any good as these guys just said to reinstall the software, which didn't work of course.

But in-spite of all the bumps in the road, HR Block Deluxe came through and proved itself to be a worthy opponent to Intuit's product. As far as the refund numbers from TurboTax and HR Block, the difference was a matter of a few dollars, with HR Block erring on the side of caution.",XP Windows Import Bug Is Fixed!
45586,4,H&R Block,27.9333333333333,"01 10, 2015","The oldest TurboTax file I have handy is from 1999 (I've used TurboTax a lot longer than that), and it appears that 2013 will be my last.

I think I've been using TurboTax mainly because I've become very comfortable with it. Well, with the latest TurboTax I've become uncomfortable and so I just purchased H&R Block Deluxe. It costs a lot less and does more. I'm hoping to get ""comfortable"" with it this year.

Some simple/initial observations...

I installed it and it wanted me to create an account on H&R Block - maybe I'll do that later. I got the updates for the Federal Form and tried to get my free State form. A dialog box popped up and said it wasn't available until next week - they'll email me when it's available. I guess that's not a problem for me as I usually don't do my returns until I get all of the forms in the mail.

I imported my TurboTax from last year and it seemed to have worked. I did a quick check on a couple of things and they were there correctly. I'll find out about the bulk of the import later when I actually sit down to do my return later this year.

I tried to save my initial form as a PDF file. It required me to install yet another virtual PDF printer - I now have 3 of them. It seemed to work OK for my Federal form, but was a little clumsy with my saved data (some of the lines are split between pages).

So far it seems to be OK. I'll get use to the layout and look for some of those things that I'm familiar with using TurboTax. I'll update my review when I get more time with it.

Update #1:
I got my state update without any issues. It does seem that the State and Fed forms don't get updated as often as they did with TurboTax - not sure if they don't make as many mistakes, they don't fix as may issues, or maybe they just like to batch more updates per release? Anyway, I'm waiting for all of my mail statements to arrive before I start using it for real. More to come...

Update #2:
I entered my federal and Arizona State information and have a few observations (I haven't filed yet).

1. When I hit the Back button with TurboTax I go back one page, with H&R Block software I go back to the beginning of the section then I have to continue to hit the Next button to get back to the page I want to see. Not sure whey they don't just go back one page?

2. It seems easier to see the Federal/State form and enter data on it with the H&R Block software - for me it's just the way they setup the GUI.

3. The window that shows your refund/payment with the H&R Block software doesn't always update when you go to the Next screen. When this happens I suspect they want to make sure of some other things before they update the numbers. I just appeared funny the first time I saw it, but I got used to it.

4. With the H&R Block software I wasn't able to put simple formulas in the calculation forms that I created for individual entries. I got around this by making multiple entries in the form.

5. According to the H&R Block web site the Arizona forms are complete, but in the software window it indicated that if I wanted to use Form 348 I would have to print it out and enter my answer back into the H&R Block software. I never had to do this with TurboTax.

6. Also on the State return it indicated there is some kind of issue with the AZ legislature on a deduction I want to take. The software says that they'll update the form if the legislature adopts the deduction, however I haven't been able to figure out the status of this item from the Arizona Tax Web site, so I don't know if the form is out of date or correct. I will continue to investigate this one.

Update #3:

I finished entering all of my data, printed my returns, created PDF files, and continued to the end of the program. A few more observations:

1. As I noticed when I initially used it, the supplied PDF printer/creator for your forms that you mail out look fine, but the file that it creates for your saved data sometimes splits lines between pages.

2. I successfully printer my Federal and State forms and saved them as PDF files - they all look fine.

3. At then end, the ""audit analyzer"" just say's you look OK. As I recall Turbo Tax shows you risk by categories (nice feature that I miss)

4. At the end, it doesn't show you a comparison of you previous year return and this years return like it does with Turbo Tax. I like seeing both as it may remind me that I have forgotten something.

Bottom line is that the software appears to work, but it's sometimes clunky and sometimes better than TurboTax. I'm still not sure about the long time between updates for the forms (see my earlier comment), and I'm still getting use to the way H&R Block presents its data, but if things stay the same next year I'll most likely stick with H&R Block software. Note that I have seen that TurboTax is promising to put all of the stuff back in to Deluxe that they removed this year, but it still cost $20 more than H&R Block Deluxe...

Note that I knocked off 1 star because of the few issues I discovered above that I had not seen with TurboTax - especially where the software required me to go the AZ Web site, print a form, fill it out by hand, and enter the data in the H&R Block software.

I've been using H&R Block  software for at least 20 years. It used to be called TaxCut (and I actually liked that name better.). There are two basic Tax Software companies - H&R Block and Turbo Tax by Intuit). I find that H&RB is somewhat cheaper and more user friendly. There are three levels of the software. In H&RB's case, it is Standard (Federal only), Deluxe (with and without state - but if you live in a stare with a state income tax you should buy the with state combo - much cheaper than adding a state later) and Premium (which really is for more detailed help for self-employed people). If you know how to fill in a Schedule C then you can use the Deluxe too. There are just more ""interview"" questions in Premium. I use the Deluxe.

Though I'm reviewing H&RB here, I'll point out helpful info for those who have used TurboTax in the past. If you have any need for Sched D - capital gains or capital gains dividends - you will need to buy the TT fancier version this year. The Basic version doesn't allow you to do a schedule D. This is another reason to use H&RB.

Now the reason I downgraded it from 5 stars is that you only get ONE State filing with either the Deluxe or Premium.  If you live in one state and work in another, you will need to buy (via download) an additional state module. This now costs $34.95 per state which is actually the same list price as the Federal& State package. And you can find the Fed & State on sale often. (Amazon had - as it did last year - a one day sale on January 2nd at 55% off. But there is no way to save on those additional states. Personally I think H&RB is getting greedy there. I think Turbo Tax does the same thing - but has a higher list price.

If your return is simple then by all means use the software. But you might want to also check out local CPAs, who have tax training, and see what their rates are.  It may not cost that much more than the time and effort you spend using either H&RB or TT, and they will be able to offer you support too and offer suggestions.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

I experienced minimal, what I call ""looping"" errors, in which tax software asks you to provide some basically irrelevant information during error checking that should have been automatically adjusted but a change you made threw that automatic adjustment out of whack. So you keep getting asked for information out of context but the interface and help sections cannot tell you how to answer. It is usually like, ""On line 45 of section 3, you entered '0'; this cannot be a '0.' Enter the correct number of insignificant manifestations now.""

All tax programs claim to give guidance, but the help sections are often limited.

45612,4,H&R Block,34.6,"05 22, 2015","For the past 10 years I was using Turbotax Deluxe + State. This year I switched to H&R Tax Deluxe + State because Turbotax Deluxe no longer includes schedule D (capital gains and losses). After using it, I am very pleased with H&R Tax Deluxe and will use it next year. The user experience is less polished than Turbotax (eg less helps and hints) but I actually like this minimalist approach better, ie less distraction, direct to the meat.
Pros:
- I was able to import my tax infos from my Turbotax 2013 file, no problem.
- price: $18 for H&R Tax Deluxe + State vs $45 Turbotax Deluxe + State (and no schedule D)
Cons: two issues I hope will be solved in future versions (thus only 4 stars)
- I could not import my W2 in H&R Tax, I had to do it manually. In Turbotax, I eventually found out how to import my 2013 W2 after some fiddling, so I still have some hope for next year with H&R Tax Deluxe after some more fiddling.
- It took me some time to figure out where to declare dividend income in H&R Tax. It is a minor issue though, I just need to get used to H&R Tax Deluxe procedure, next year should be smoother.",H&R Deluxe + States is minimalist in a good way vs Turbotax Deluxe

45614,4,H&R Block,34.6,"05 15, 2015","Repeating what many others have said (and those reviews were why I bought this product), I used to use TurboTax, mostly out of habit and convenience. TurboTax changed their pricing to be more expensive and changed their product model to make me have to do more work to figure out which product I needed to use. They broke me out of my habit by forcing me to do my research, and I thank them for that, because it brought me to H&R, which is just as easy and maybe even more clear than TT, plus significantly cheaper. H&R is my new habit, until they screw it up....

Loading in my 2013 TT return was easy and seamless. H&R's upgrade process and State download process could have been easier -- both required restarts of the application (automatic, though). Also, it was a bit annoying to download the application then immediately update to a full new application for the upgrade (I was on a slow international connection), but the application download was a lot smaller than the TT application anyway. Not an issue for 99.99% of users.

I hope that customers desert TT in droves so that this will be a pro-consumer lesson for future b-school candidates. This was a typical management-consultant kind of recommendation, and it usually works to extract money out of unwitting consumers. But this time around, consumers seem to be getting better educated.

If you don't need to itemize, I'd recommend using H&R Online filing, which is free I think. I haven't tried TurboTax for a few years now, but prices are similar, so I appreciate the continuity of using the same software each year. Data imports from the previous year are automatic, as long as you still have the files in their previous location (another reason to use this instead of the online version). I use an encrypted archive with a folder for each tax year, and open the archive to work on taxes. Big plus is it walks you through scenarios so you can determine whether a deduction or credit applies to you. It's very much like an interview with your tax person, and quite simple once you get over the intimidation of doing your own taxes.

We have a lot of things making our tax returns complicated, and this software I thought was pretty easy to use. I tried turbotax last year for the first time and was not impressed at all as I had to file some corrections on things that they missed or didn't allow. I'm much happier with H&R Block's method. Most of our financial institutions were not listed so had to be entered by hand, but that was doable.
Today I did try to chat on line with their help. Probably over an hour wait with messages saying ""you're next"", but when I finally did chat, the lady was very nice, very patient. As it turned out she could not help me as I think there is a glitch in their Montana software to limit the amount allowed for MSA health account ... would not allow me to add the interest which is obviously allowed.

It would have cost me a whole lot more to process all these forms with TurboTax with their shameful upsell strategy.

45841,4,H&R Block,45.95,"12 25, 2014","I had been using TurboTax Deluxe in all prior years as I know enough of the basic tax rules to not need the extra guidance for investments or a Schedule C (i.e. self-employed unincorporated) business to not need their more expensive versions.  Unfortunately starting 2014, TurboTax is leaving anybody who is self-employed &/or has investments no choice but to buy their much more expensive ""Home & Business"" version even when your situation is simple enough to not require any guidance.  As this comes at a time when all the tax-related investment information necessary is usually on the 1099 which is directly downloadable into the program, this seems like needless exploitation of our need for a good & reliable & comprehensive tax program given that it worked just fine to handle it as they did in previous years i.e. only require the more expensive versions for people wanting more guidance.

THE DOWNLOAD OPTION WORKED GREAT & VERY FAST & I LOVE THE CONVENIENCE & SAFETY of knowing the program is downloadable again from my Amazon software library any time I may have to upgrade or switch or re-set up my computer without having to safely store & be able to find the original disk.

I WAS INITIALLY DISAPPOINTED TO FIND NO STATE TAX SUPPORT (not even for my high-tech popular state of CA) UNTIL 15Jan AS THAT MEANS NO PRE YEAR-END PLANNING POSSIBLE FOR STATE TAXES & THAT IS THIS PROGRAM'S BIGGEST DRAWBACK SO FAR.  It is unfortunate in that the extent of state taxes due for the year that might be worth pre-paying before year-end is one of the critical aspects of pre year-end tax planning.  That's because one needs to make sure the state payments won't trigger needless AMT (=Alternative Minimum Tax) given that the latter wipes out the federal tax deduction benefits of the advance state tax payment.  FORTUNATELY I already have a good basic tax estimator so I usually have a pretty accurate # for likely state tax bill.  That made it easy to work around this drawback as the most critical need on my end for pre year-end tax software is to double-check AMT impact of different scenarios & the AMT & all relevant aspects of federal taxes all worked great.

SO, DESPITE NO STATE TAX SUPPORT IN TIME FOR PRE-YEAR END TAX PLANNING, ITS WAY CHEAPER PRICING THAN TURBOTAX + WAY FASTER & EASIER NAGIVATION MADE ME GRATEFUL TO DISCOVER THIS PROGRAM AS A GOOD ALTERNATIVE TO TT especially if the latter keeps making moves to unnecessarily exploit our dependence on them.

I LOVE H&R ENABLING YOU TO EASILY PULL UP & LEAVE ON DISPLAY ANY DESIRED TAX FORM AS YOU WORK SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT WILL SHOW ON THE ACTUAL TAX RETURN AS YOU MAKE CHANGES.  That makes it so much easier & faster to fine-tune & correct as you go vs. needing to pull up the printed version of the entire tax return & search for the relevant section each time in TurboTax.

IN ADDITION TO INCORPORATING STATE TAX CALCULATIONS BY 15-DEC, MY OTHER BIG SUGGESTION FOR IMPROVEMENT TO THE H&R PROGRAM would be to make their ""Forms"" display text much more easily legible by making it possible to rapidly enlarge either automatically as soon as one drags the window to be wider or by using the ""command & +"" keys as works on most mac & even windows programs these days.  It just makes working with tax numbers so much easier when it's all easily legible & easy to rapidly pick out & unfortunately changing the resolution of the monitor so the text shows up bigger would make the other portions of the program & everything else on my computer come up way too big, hence the value of the ""command & + or -"" keys to enlarge or reduce instantly whenever helpful.",would be 5+ stars if state tax calculations were included by 15-Dec for proper year-end planning BUT GREAT OTHERWISE

I hope this saves everybody some time!

45853,4,H&R Block,45.95,"01 28, 2015","Former loyal TurboTax customer, tired of Intuit's price gouging, tried H&R Block software and so far have found it nearly identical to TurboTax.

Here are the highlights of my experience (I filed just before writing this mid-February update to my initial review).

The good:

I was able to load my previous tax return which saves a lot of time and effort.
Very easy to go through the entries - similar to TurboTax
Costs about half as much as TurboTax
I got a slightly larger refund this year than I did last year (using TurboTax), but I mention this only to make the point that this software is approximately equal to TurboTax on the refund front.

The less than good:

As mentioned, the H&R software entered last year's TurboTax data so it tracked my carryovers, etc., but last year I paid interest on two mortgages and it grabbed both automatically.  At the end of the process it would not let me efile because there was a zero on one of the lines on Schedule A and I could not figure out how to change the form.  I waited on ""chat"" for over an hour before someone came on line and by that time I had figured it out.

I saw in the reviews that someone else had had trouble submitting their electronic return (it won't let you proceed until you fix some things), so this is an area where H&R needs to step up and make some improvements.  Also they need more people providing technical support.

Overall:

I think this software is a viable option to Turbotax.  I also think it is important to poke TurboTax/Intuit in the eye over their price gouging.  They may have slightly better software, but they need to understand that they can't take their customers for granted.",Viable alternative to TurboTax at half the cost.

45871,4,H&R Block,40.95,"04 9, 2015","I had been a consistent TurboTax customer for well over 10 years. I had read in previous years that the HRB software wasn't as functional in regard to handling complex business returns in comparison to TT. However, the continual pricing increases by TT over the last several years made me decide that 2015 was the year to switch HRB. I am glad I did.
I've given HRB 4 stars. If was price alone, I'd give them 6 stars. However, I have to subtract 2 stars as you can not import previous years tax files into the HRB business portion of the software. Also I wish HRB had the product available for a Mac OS. Getting back to the business program, you do have to re-enter everything piecemeal. The program will not import a TT file. Also for all of February, I continually received a message that the 1065 form (the information form for partnerships) was not available.  What gives with that??? So the business program leaves much to be desired, at least on the 1065 side of the program. I don't know about the other types of business schedules.
The Individual Premium portion of the software (which is really a separate program) worked flawlessly in the importing of last years TT files.
The depreciation schedules are much easier to set up in HRB. The transition to the Forms mode is easier in the HRB program.
I commend HRB for seemingly keeping the program (particularly the individual program) lean and mean. You don't get the feeling that the computer's processer is being overtaxed (pun intended) by graphic files and continual requests to update the software, which is what you get with TT. It is apparent that Intuit has lost touch with the program and the idea that we just want to file our taxes for a reasonable price.
To any HRB product manager, I am now your customer. Thanks for keeping the program sleek and very afordable. There are some major improvements that could be made with the business program. Also for us Mac fans/users, this combination program made compatible with a Mac OS would put HRB light years ahead of Intuit.",Another TurboTax Turncoat

The Personal software is good but not as good as TurboTax, and it gets the job done and all the functionality is there. The Business software is not great but it does what I need it to do for a simple trust tax return. I have not used TurboTax business, so I have no basis of comparison.",Not as good as TurboTax but costs significantly less and gets the job done.

This year I purchased the download version of Turbo Tax Deluxe which has been my standard version of choice since it covers everything that I need including schedule C, D and E. I made the mistake of not reading the fine print before I ordered and relied on my faith in the company. Mistake on my part! When I reached the input section for brokerage and self employment I was kindly told that my version that I purchased will no longer support these forms, but they would happily upgrade for another $40. Okay, I understand the need to grow your profits. Before I clicked the upgrade button I decided to check the competition and found that the Premium version of H&R Block supports all of these forms for the same price as the upgrade to Turbo Tax. Instead of upgrading I just outright purchased H&R Block's version and decided to spend the extra 5 bucks to include the business module. I have found that, while Turbo Tax is easy to use, H&R has an incredibly simple format that they use. I actually find it superior as an end user. It does import last year's data from Turbo Tax which is a big plus. I won't even bother with Turbo Tax next year.",H&R Block software is the best value.

I'm posting a review before my purchase this year because I couldn't help but notice that Amazon seems to be trying to generate consumer bias for specific tax software bundles that benefit Amazon, and that's not so cool. The only versions of the H&R Block's tax software available as a download this year are those that include the Amazon 10% Refund Bonus Offer (i.e. if you use a portion of your refund to purchase Amazon gift cards, they will tack on ""up to"" 10% more); and in the case of the Deluxe Federal Only version, the one with the Amazon tie-in costs less as well ($24.97 versus $29.95 at the time of this review).

If you already planned to spend your refund on Amazon gift cards, that's a great deal, but this marketing method tries to sway you to do so whether you'd intended to or not. Sure, you can get the downloadable version and choose not to take advantage of the gift card bonus when it comes up in the tax prep dialogue, but who's going to pass up that carrot once it is there in your face?

45958,4,H&R Block,34.6,"04 2, 2016","I bought H&R Block in 2014 because of the infamous TurboTax switch that suddenly required previous Deluxe users to buy the next more expensive package to get the same forms. TurboTax clearly learned their lesson big time. This past year I was turned off by all the excessive marketing mailings and emails I got from H&R Block, especially in December 2015 and January 2016, so I went back and bought TurboTax for 2015 tax year even though it cost me like $8 more. However without even opening TurboTax I returned it when I discovered it would only work if my computer is upgraded to the very latest operating system, while H&R Block will still run on an earlier operating system thats four years old now. TurboTax requiring me to back up and change my operating system and reinstall all my software before I could begin my taxes trumped all other considerations. And it probably will again next year.

That said, Ive used TurboTax for years and there are quite a few downsides to H&R Block besides the excessive marketing I already metnioned.

This may be a minor issue to you, but H&R block formatting is sometimes bad in multiple ways. Both pdf and hard copies often print a row of text that gets split across the bottom of one page and top of the next page, so that either top or bottom  of every character is cropped off. Over and over theres an orphan row of text from the previous page printed out at the top of an otherwise blank sheet of paper. The H&R block font on the forms is smaller and harder to read than TurboTax. There is less variety of font size on the H&R Block forms, so major headings don't stand out clearly from minor headings, and in general simply doesnt look as professional or easy to follow as TurboTax. TurboTax prints global page numbers at the bottom when I print out a set of forms with the supporting documentation as in page x of xx, H&R Block does not. Both my filed version and my supporting docs version were printed out in my printer. If I hadnt saved pdfs, itd be awfully hard to figure out where one H&R Block printout ended and the next printout began. All minor annoyances, but they add up.

Make sure you load your state module before you begin preparing your federal taxes. H&R Block correctly handled the portion of vehicle registration that was fed deductible last year. However this year I got some kind of error message for loading the state module when I first checked for updates, and I went ahead and entered the federal first. That was a mistake. Then once I loaded the state module it brought up a worksheet for vehicle registration. However it would never go back and correctly calculate the portion of my vehicle registration that was fed deductible, it would only put in the full amount of registration page. The only reason I knew the federal vehicle registration (tax) amount was wrong was because I googled this and a TurboTax help page described the correct calculation, and I checked my 2014 H&R block tax returns and it was a lower amount that matched the calculation formula I found online.

H&R Block seemed kind of confused about whether Id already loaded the latest federal updates. This was the first thing I did when I first put in the CD, yet it came back and asked me to get federal updates later in the same evening.

Also the first thing it does is automatically ask me to check for and load state updates when I hadnt even loaded the state module in the first place yet, and then gave me an inexplicable error message. That reflects poorly on the H&R Block software if its that confused - and confusing to the user. So it automatically asks you first about updates, but theres nothing automatic at all about prompting you how to download the state part in the first place. It was not at all intuitive to figure this out. Ive already paid for the state module, so why do you require me to figure out on my own I need to click a button that says buy to download it to my computer?

Just fyi, a search for registration did not turn up the correct place to Go To in fed form because this is called a state/local vehicle tax (general terminology to cover all 50 states). It is not called vehicle registration anywhere in the forms, because thats only what some states call it. It took some guesswork to figure out the right place to enter this fee (tax) on the fed side. I realize all the states are different, but state and local vehicle tax is vague enough it sounds like it could be about sales tax on vehicles purchased across state lines or something.

TurboTax does not get off scot free, either. Last time I used it two years ago TurboTax botched the calculation of points for my home mortgage - it asked me for total points from refinancing (paid in a prior tax year) and no matter what I tried it then insisted on applying all of them to a single (2013) year instead of spreading them over the life of the mortgage (as is generally required). I cant remember what I had to do to fix it but it included calling TurboTax support and reporting a glitch in the software. Neither home mortgage refinancing points spread over the life of a mortgage or motor vehicle registration are exactly obscure esoteric tax conditions that only apply to a small handful of people. To H&R Blocks credit, what they messed up in 2015 tax year had to do with a complex state issue and might only be a cascading consequence of their lack of clear prompts for downloading state modules and giving error messages for their automatic updates prompt, where  the spreading mortgage points glitch in TurboTax for 2013 tax year was something thats applied the same way in all 50 states.

Bottom line: if I already have the latest OS on my computer ever year anyway Id probably tip toward TurboTax.

That was a very poor business decision for Turbo Tax.  So, I'm one of the many that made the switch and I'm very happy that I did.  Not only does this software do exactly what I purchased it to do (Deluxe version), but it is much less expensive than Turbo Tax.  I found no reason to switch back.  My return this year was much more complicated because of settling an estate and I wasn't sure if this version would work for the sale of a home, but it did.  While the interview process didn't take me to exactly where I needed to go, the ""help"" and online features explained in detail how to get there.

I will stay with H&R Block for years to come.  Note:  H&B Block will probably send you a new CD version going into the next tax season with a discount price to file, but I found that by waiting, Amazon did much better.  I paid only $19.99 for the DELUXE version while they had it on sale.  That was WAY to good to pass up.",A better solution than Turbo Tax

Amazon emails don't show that detail, and order history shows this page (which may have been updated).  So HR wants $40 now for state, which is MORE than the cost of federal+state, also here on Amazon.  For $5 more than my original purchase, I would have had the product I needed, but now I'm spending double.  I'm not sure the market for federal without state filing is really that big - I think this is a gimmick to get people to pay more money than they expected because it's too late to change course by the time you've already filled out your data and are ready to file.

I am insulted that they don't think I know that isn't a deal at all and that they would steal $5-10 a year from loyal customers if we let them.

46093,4,H&R Block,34.6,"02 24, 2016","First time using H&R block.  The only reason I switched over to this was because of the 10% refund bonus so I can fund my Amazon addiction without feeling as bad about it.

I've used TurboTax for the last 10+ years so I was hesitant to switch over.  My taxes aren't overly complicated though (Married Filing Joint, mortgage) so I figured what's the worst that could happen.

There's many reviews out there about the pros and cons of Turbotax vs H&R block.  I suggest you do a Google search if you want to get into the nitty gritty, but nevertheless, here are my thoughts.

Pros:

Local earned income tax prompt.  This was great.  Turbotax never prompted me about my local taxes before. (Just moved into a municipality in PA where this is required) so I didn't know that I even had to file this until I got a fat bill from the credit collectors.  H&R block's software asks you if you want to print out the sheet and it will fill in the appropriate fields for you.  You still have to mail it (no e-file) but I'm not aware of any software besides PA's own website that allows you to e-file directly.

Prompted me for deducting my past years payments to the state.  Maybe Turbotax does it in the background, I don't know, but I've never seen that before.  Last year I owed PA 200-300 bucks, and I was able to deduct that this year.  H&R block had a message stating that the deduction is often overlooked.  Was nice.

10% bonus.  Speaks for itself.

Cons:

The software is very utilitarian.  You won't get the nice transitions and cool animations that you get with Turbotax.  If you're a sucker for cool UIs this won't cut it.  Not to say that it's bad, but there's a noticeable difference in the UX design.

Import kind of sucks.  Turbotax has a much better importing process.  I wasn't able to import my Wells Fargo accounts (really?) maybe they will update this later.  I also wasn't able to import my W2 from W2Express.  I found this pretty annoying as I've had absolutely no issues with Turbotax importing my documents.  The only thing that it picked up was my Fidelity account *pats H&R block on back*.

I found this software to be more prone to errors.  I'm not a tax guru, but I had to manually change things in my return more than once.  Possibly a localized issue.

When importing my last years Turbotax return into H&R block it created a bunch of ""dummy"" 1099's and whatnot that I filed last year.  I guess this is nice if you forget what you are supposed to file but I ended up deleting all of them and re-creating them.

The return tracking process is not great.  It accurately picked up the acceptance of my state and federal return but it never updated with the ""approved"" status on my federal.  Not a huge deal since you can just use the IRS's apps, but I thought that was weird.  After the initial acceptance email I received from H&R block I did not get any further emails about the status.

Final thoughts, I thought it was fine.  I'm still undecided on which software to go to next year, but it will probably be the one with the 10% bonus.  I received my Amazon e-gift card 1 business day after the federal return posted to my bank account.  No issues with redemption.",The great conversion
46094,4,H&R Block,34.6,"02 24, 2016","I ordered this from Amazon in December, but didn't load it until February, when I was finally ready to do my taxes.  Big mistake, apparently.  H&R Block insisted they had no record of my purchase, apparently because I had waited to load it until after the 60-day refund time limit.  After talking to several different Amazon customer service people (I kept getting cut off), they agreed to refund the purchase price, but that left me only the option of paying for the software directly ft H&R Block, with no discounts and no promotions.  Once it was paid for, however, it worked very well.  It took me through the process smoothly and usually with no questions.  One thing that was annoying was that as I neared the end of the process, it told me I had skipped or mis-entered something earlier.  I went back to fix the problem, but then had to go through all the intermediate steps again, rather than returning directly to where I had left off.  It ended up taking about three hours (including time on the phone with customer service) to complete my taxes, and I think it did them correctly.  At least I'm getting a refund.",Don't wait to load the software

It is a shame that it could not have gone electronically without costing me extra money!

I knew it should be in there because I had done it before.  I had to search the forms and find it on the tax sheet.

Hey Intuit you lost a customer of about 15 years doing that you morons!  So we got it and H&R Block imported things just fine last year.  It took a little getting used to, but no real issues.  It was no better or worse from a functional standpoint than the more expensive Turbotax, though the help files were slightly more cumbersome.  Nothing major.

Does it work?  Yes, it's fine and we had no issues doing our taxes with mortgage, minor stock dividend stuff, and some forms like W-G for gambling winnings.  Is it as good as Turbotax, well no.  It's not quite as polished and doesn't look as slick.  For example, updates aren't as seamlessly hidden as with Turbotax.  I even got a disturbing error message after the last program update.  I'm sure it's still fine, the program doesn't seem to be acting differently, but the last thing you want is a glitch in your tax software.  Probably going to wait for the next update on 2/15/16 and see if it gives any errors then.  Frankly, I'd just rather wait for updates in the first couple months on any tax software before submitting anyway.

So yeah, for cheaper cost and a company that I don't think is going to turn around and try to screw me, if only because they are a distant second in market share, it's well worth the money.  I have no qualms about suggesting it for anything but the most complicated of tax returns.

I don't have much sympathy for those who don't read the product description and buy the Federal Only application when they need Federal+State (FYI, it's ~$35 to buy Federal+State out of the gate). However, there is apparently an issue with the application if you are claiming the Child Tax Credit. The verification step will not complete, complaining that publication 972 is needed and will be released with the next update.

There is a thread on the H&R forums about this issue dating back to January 19th. According to the thread, they are not releasing an update until February 15th. If you don't need the Child Tax Credit, I've been very happy with H&R in the past and it has handled all of my previous returns flawlessly. If you need the Child Credit and don't want to wait until the 15th, I'd look elsewhere.

I'm holding out until the 15th. If everything gets handled then, I'll update this review.

Edit: According to another thread on the H&R forum, the issue may be due a combination of attempting to claim both the child tax credit AND the solar tax credit. It's still a bug preventing me from completing my return and won't be fixed (hopefully) until the 15th. But it may be more limited in scope than I originally thought.

With as varied as tax submissions can be and software dev in general, I can excuse a software bug. I can't say I'm ok with a one month release cycle. That seems excessive. I never came across an official response or acknowledgement to this bug, or any bug, to know for sure whether it was being worked on.

46214,4,H&R Block,54.0,"05 27, 2017","In the last couple of years had a few small glitches, where it flags some mistakes/inconsistencies, that are not apparent why they were mistakes.
it seems to me the TC introduced these mistakes all on his own. I had to scratch my head, like there were some fields not filled in in the worksheets, was not obvious  why.  But, overall a pretty good, easy to use tax prep package, have been using it since I switched from Turbotax many years ago.
I usually do 4 returns, the family's, my 2 kids, and my mother -in-laws. It typically takes me a day and a half  for the 4 returns, fed and state. Some of the time is spent tracking down missing docs.  The data entry time per return is maybe an hour or two per return.

There are 2 major tax prep packages: TT ( TurboTax and TC (TaxCut, aka H&R Block).
(TT had some disagreeable practices years ago, which is why I switched to TC). TC is usually cheaper than TT, when you factor in the 5 free E-files.
and it t is pretty good about picking up all of its prior year's data.  Once you start using a particular tax package, it is usually just simpler to stick with it, unless they have a major screw-up, or the competition offers a significant incentive.  The only way I would try TT again, if they offered a min. 30% meaningful ""competitive upgrade"" discount, and if they picked up the TC prior year data seamlessly.  But, TT costs more, and it is a risk of wasting a day or two to try them out again, so I dont.","TC and TT are probably pretty close in functionality, TC is marginally cheaper."

46224,4,H&R Block,54.0,"09 15, 2016","This is my experience with the 2015 tax program, but since they went from Tax Cut to the current incarnation, one year's pretty much the same as the other, as far as the user interface and layout goes.

It's not perfect, but I've used H&R Block exclusively now for some time, since it was called Tax Cut.  My needs are fairly simple and most of my tax returns have been fairly straight forward.  I've had to use email based tax support once, to make sure I wasn't filing a disbursement incorrectly, and they were prompt about responding to my emails.  That was tax questions, however,- not software support.  The promise of tax question support, including audit assistance, and the favorable price point compared to other tax programs, when I first started using it under the H&R Block Tax Cut branding, were the deciding factors.  The program, to my knowledge, hasn't made a mistake, and I've never had a problem e-filing Federal and State returns.

A big note, and the reason I'm writing this- it does not support Linux.  H&R Block really needs to get on the ball, and sell a version that will run on the popular Linux distros.  I've switched away from Windows, and I can attest that it doesn't run properly in WINE- there's an error during installation and when you run the program, the screen doesn't layout correctly, and it has limited keyboard/mouse response.  It don't work.

However, I have, by all appearances, successfully installed, executed, and loaded my already completed 2015 return, while running Windows 10 inside VirtualBox.- that included downloading the tax form updates, the state program, and then, since I'd already completed my returns, connecting with the servers to verify that my returns from last year had been accepted.  No problems so far running in a virtual machine- slow, but no problems so far.  Before the 2016 tax cycle rolls around, I may plug in all my 2015 data from scratch to see that the return results are the same, and ofc I've not had chance to e-file a return, but I don't see why there would be problems, given the program does seem to display and respond correctly and has internet connectivity thru the VM.

I would think that editing your taxes might be easier on Turbotax, but for the initial run and the type of taxes I was knocking out, the H&R Block was easier.
Second, the five free Federal tax returns were nice as well.
The bad is that five is the magic number and then you have to buy a new package. But when you do that and install the new package, it makes it incredibly hard to do anything with the first package. And you can't just look at old returns unless you have kept all the old State packages which you had to buy after the first free one.

46242,4,H&R Block,54.0,"05 18, 2016","I'm writing this review in hopes of helping someone who is searching for the elusive self-employed health insurance deduction with Obamacare, something very few tax software programs have gotten right the last couple years.

This year, it's okay. It did the job, after screwing me over in 2014 and not being able to handle the Affordable Care Act deduction for the self-employed (and giving an error notice at the END of the return interview process with hours spent, that I instead need to contact an HR Block office and pay to have them finish my return!), it appears HR Block yet again screwed over many customers not having this in their program for 2015 returns, EXCEPT with the last final late update done the end of March 2016 it appears it is now working. ...Because it did shockingly allow my self-employed health insurance deduction for Obamacare this time even though several blogs I read earlier in 2016 (for 2015 return) said HR Block software had not been updated for this feature leaving alot of customers in the lurch. Well it appears they finally got it right.
For all those who filed their returns early and missed this deduction, you may want to re-open your software, do an update, and see if your tax liability changes or if it now accepts the self-employed health insurance deduction for Obamacare as you could possibly want to file an amended return if the savings are great enough. For me they would've been. Lucky for me I guess I waited til the last minute (they say the early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese, haha). This is only an issue with the self employed who have Obamacare, because all of these programs handle simple old self-employed health insurance deductions (as long as its separate from the Affordable Care Act).

I've found after a disaster this year with TurboTax and a disaster last year with HR Block, that THERE IS NO PERFECT software. They all have some things lacking and issues meaning you will have to pick the 'best of a bad bunch' based on your tax needs. TurboTax also handles the self-employed Obamacare deduction this year, however their program is wrought with errors, glitches, and the inability to import simple data from HR Block last year. As an example, it imported none of my vehicles and depreciation info so I had to abandon them after hours spent with their software and entering data. by contrast HR Block 2015 imported all of the above from the prior year, no issues and no errors.
This year somehow HR Block got it right though, albeit the last minute, and I'd use the program again next time. Just remember on a complicated return, there is no perfect software in my opinion. Do your research and pick the best one, and be prepared to buy a second set of software if you have to. Seems wasteful but its deductible, and better than having to pay an accountant $700 for a complex return.

For me, even though I do know my tax forms I had some hard time tracking down every cross-reference (this was for some odd K-1 input).  Additionally, you have to be  a bit careful about setting up double forms and not realizing it.

46287,4,H&R Block,54.0,"04 21, 2016","Since i'm not a tax pro or an accountant, I'm very paranoid about doing taxes using the software. So every year, I would use both H&R and TurboTax to file the tax and then compare the results. (For CD version, you don't have to pay until you're ready to file). Yes, it's double the work, but it gives me a sense of assurance, and my tax isn't complicated at all. This year, I added the additional of TaxAct Premium. Out of the 3, I highly recommend sticking with H&R or TurboTax. In fact, I would suggest TurboTax first and then H&R.

For someone who has simple return (a job and some stock investment), H&R and TurboTax correctly ask you the question, and guide you on how to enter the W2 information. Another benefit of using the downloaded version, is that it can automatically import your previous year's tax filing from major tax software companies (H&R, TurboTax, TaxAct) and saves you time of entering all those info. The software also checks for update every time you open it, to make sure you have the latest version of forms. When it comes to asking questions, TurboTax does it one step better than H&R. It's more intuitive and clear. But since I've been using the software for 5+ years now, I'm used to how it work. For beginners, I highly recommend TurboTax. TurboTax is more expensive, but also more user friendly. Majority of my friends use TurboTax.

The Deluxe version for either TurboTax or H&R would be sufficient for someone of my need. For tax year 2014, TurboTax Deluxe didn't include Schedule D, which caused outrage from usual TurboTax users. For this year 2015, they included that back in the software version. So you don't have get the Premium version if you don't need it (free for me unless I file). Both H&R and TurboTax offer a quick automatic check on your tax info to make sure what you put down is correct and in line with what the normal users would have. It gives an extra peace of insurance.

SUPPORT:

For support both H&R and TurboTax replied back within hours thru email. Some time it may take longer, but within 24 hours. TaxAct could take from few hours to 2 days for email support. They all have call support as well, but I didn't need to use it, so can't comment on it.

INSTALLATION:

TurboTax was provided thru CD, and H&R and TaxAct were provided thru download. It was pretty easy and straightforward. One thing I noticed was, the installer for H&R doesn't come with State. It will ask you which state, download it, and then restart the software. I guess they tried to minimize the software size which makes sense. Why choose download version? Because you can work on your laptop without internet connection until you're ready to efile. This is ideal for someone on the go a lot. Also, you don't have to constantly have to sign back in on the website if you take a break.

COST:

As many other users have mentioned, TurboTax is more expensive than H&R and TaxAct, with TaxAct being the cheapest (when it runs promo). I got H&R during Amazon promo period, for 15 bucks, which was a very good deal. And the Amazon version has a 10% bonus if you convert any portion of your refund money into Amazon gift card. That's a good news for frequent Amazon shopper like myself.

Overall, I'm happy with H&R block. For the price and performance, it's hard to beat. And it's backed by a pool of knowledgeable professionals.",Comparing H&R block Deluxe vs TurboTax Premium vs TaxAct Premium

After entering everything for online Basic filing, I finally called to find out there is no compatibility between the two. The downloaded software is totally separate from any online account and information cannot be migrated either way. After a 12 minute hold time at 8am (Friday), I learned this and was offered a refund for the software if I wanted to pay to file my already completed online forms (I declined). It would be nice if the two options (software vs online) could talk to each other but just don't follow the website link/prompt if you paid for software!

46306,4,H&R Block,54.0,"04 2, 2016","I find the middling (sometimes harsh) reviews of H&R products interesting. I used TurboTax for years but was put off by last years shenanigans. I snagged both TaxAct and Block for 2014, liked (not loved) them both and found all yielded similar results on three different returns. The UX is different on each product; some will be a better match than others depending on your needs/likes. I ultimately opted for Block Deluxe as I only wanted to mess with one tax product for 2015.

So far the experience has been mostly positive having worked through two fairly basic and one modestly complex return. Screens are clear, data input easy, navigation intuitive. Guidance in most cases is concise and useful. There is always room for improvement; plenty of reviews that call out specifics. For me it gets the job done in a straight forward, mostly 'bling free' manner. No dancing bunnies or pop-up personalities trying to provide 'helpful' assistance at every turn. Yes - there are a few up-sell screens but they are modest offers that some may appreciate. I'm ok with that. They do not constantly reappear or try to scare/shame you into an additional purchase.

That said, H&R Block may not be the right product if your return is complex or you need plenty of hand holding (although it could provide a useful start if you use Block's walk-in services). Be aware import capabilities are limited to their own products; it would not read my TaxAct or TurboTax files. However, the financial institution import worked well with minimal delay (looking at you TurboTax). Post filing status communications are good with limited/no upsell attempts.

Don't act shocked and angry and surprised - there's no such thing as a free lunch, and if it sounds too good to be True, it probably is.

I bought H&R Block in 2014 because of the infamous TurboTax switch that suddenly required previous Deluxe users to buy the next more expensive package to get the same forms. TurboTax clearly learned their lesson big time. This past year I was turned off by all the excessive marketing mailings and emails I got from H&R Block, especially in December 2015 and January 2016, so I went back and bought TurboTax for 2015 tax year even though it cost me like $8 more. However without even opening TurboTax I returned it when I discovered it would only work if my computer is upgraded to the very latest operating system, while H&R Block will still run on an earlier operating system thats four years old now. TurboTax requiring me to back up and change my operating system and reinstall all my software before I could begin my taxes trumped all other considerations. And it probably will again next year.

That said, Ive used TurboTax for years and there are quite a few downsides to H&R Block besides the excessive marketing I already metnioned.

This may be a minor issue to you, but H&R block formatting is sometimes bad in multiple ways. Both pdf and hard copies often print a row of text that gets split across the bottom of one page and top of the next page, so that either top or bottom  of every character is cropped off. Over and over theres an orphan row of text from the previous page printed out at the top of an otherwise blank sheet of paper. The H&R block font on the forms is smaller and harder to read than TurboTax. There is less variety of font size on the H&R Block forms, so major headings don't stand out clearly from minor headings, and in general simply doesnt look as professional or easy to follow as TurboTax. TurboTax prints global page numbers at the bottom when I print out a set of forms with the supporting documentation as in page x of xx, H&R Block does not. Both my filed version and my supporting docs version were printed out in my printer. If I hadnt saved pdfs, itd be awfully hard to figure out where one H&R Block printout ended and the next printout began. All minor annoyances, but they add up.

Make sure you load your state module before you begin preparing your federal taxes. H&R Block correctly handled the portion of vehicle registration that was fed deductible last year. However this year I got some kind of error message for loading the state module when I first checked for updates, and I went ahead and entered the federal first. That was a mistake. Then once I loaded the state module it brought up a worksheet for vehicle registration. However it would never go back and correctly calculate the portion of my vehicle registration that was fed deductible, it would only put in the full amount of registration page. The only reason I knew the federal vehicle registration (tax) amount was wrong was because I googled this and a TurboTax help page described the correct calculation, and I checked my 2014 H&R block tax returns and it was a lower amount that matched the calculation formula I found online.

H&R Block seemed kind of confused about whether Id already loaded the latest federal updates. This was the first thing I did when I first put in the CD, yet it came back and asked me to get federal updates later in the same evening.

Also the first thing it does is automatically ask me to check for and load state updates when I hadnt even loaded the state module in the first place yet, and then gave me an inexplicable error message. That reflects poorly on the H&R Block software if its that confused - and confusing to the user. So it automatically asks you first about updates, but theres nothing automatic at all about prompting you how to download the state part in the first place. It was not at all intuitive to figure this out. Ive already paid for the state module, so why do you require me to figure out on my own I need to click a button that says buy to download it to my computer?

Just fyi, a search for registration did not turn up the correct place to Go To in fed form because this is called a state/local vehicle tax (general terminology to cover all 50 states). It is not called vehicle registration anywhere in the forms, because thats only what some states call it. It took some guesswork to figure out the right place to enter this fee (tax) on the fed side. I realize all the states are different, but state and local vehicle tax is vague enough it sounds like it could be about sales tax on vehicles purchased across state lines or something.

TurboTax does not get off scot free, either. Last time I used it two years ago TurboTax botched the calculation of points for my home mortgage - it asked me for total points from refinancing (paid in a prior tax year) and no matter what I tried it then insisted on applying all of them to a single (2013) year instead of spreading them over the life of the mortgage (as is generally required). I cant remember what I had to do to fix it but it included calling TurboTax support and reporting a glitch in the software. Neither home mortgage refinancing points spread over the life of a mortgage or motor vehicle registration are exactly obscure esoteric tax conditions that only apply to a small handful of people. To H&R Blocks credit, what they messed up in 2015 tax year had to do with a complex state issue and might only be a cascading consequence of their lack of clear prompts for downloading state modules and giving error messages for their automatic updates prompt, where  the spreading mortgage points glitch in TurboTax for 2013 tax year was something thats applied the same way in all 50 states.

Bottom line: if I already have the latest OS on my computer ever year anyway Id probably tip toward TurboTax. But if TurboTax is going to insist the only way I can use their product is if I take all the costs and risks associated with updating my computer operating system ever other year (sometimes backups don't restore correctly to the new OS - its happened), plus the cost to upgrade a bunch of other infrequently used software programs too, Ill take the shortcomings of H&R Block any day.","How much to sell your SS#, AdjustedGross Income (fraudulent efile esignature) from now til 2019?"

46325,4,H&R Block,54.0,"03 14, 2016","As a CPA I have been using H&R Blocks Deluxe Tax software for at least 15 years. While theyve actually cut back some of the features I found VERY helpful, I find it more user-friendly that Turbo Tax  the only other personal tax software out there. Sand its always cheaper and Amazon always has the best price the list week of the year or  often on January 2nd.

The feature I miss most is the Compare to Prior Year report (which was deleted about four years ago when HRB changed name of their tax software from Tax Cut to HRB at Home. This was a handy way to see if you missed anything from prior year or why your estimate this year was off. I sure wish theyd bring it back.

The other factor I want to alert you to (as it applies to both HRB and Turbo Tax) is the state tax program. If you live and work in the same state or there is NO STATE Income Tax in either your home or work stare, you can skip this comment. However if you have the above situation (or have rental real estate in other than your home state), you will need TWO State tax programs. HRB gives you ONE state included in the program package. EACH additional state module  which you can only buy and download from HRB  costs $39.95 plus tax. Since the Deluxe + State shouldnt cost you more than $34.95 (probably less) you are paying more for that second (or God forbi9d third state) than for your original Fed + State return. This is very common issue for those living in NY, NJ, PA, and CT. I wish that HRB would offer a  Deluxe + StateS for maybe $10-$15 more and allow up to  say  three states. But, since  like airlines  they can make more by charging for each addition extra  they probably wont
One other thing.  With the deluxe you get up to 5 free Federal e-files. But you get NO free State e-filing. That costs about another $15.00. This is really annoying. But know the cost going in.

So I would give the software five stars but am withholding one star because of the high cost of extra state modules and lack of the simple compare with last year report.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

I did run into some minor glitches with the state program:  I need two separate states, and the second one costs $40, more than the original product.  Still a good value overall, however, especially compared to TT.  Some of the questions for correctly categorizing nonresident income were a bit cryptic, but by consulting the forms it was not too hard to get things entered correctly.  Also, when printing on paper (free federal efile is included but not state) the first page printed (for both states) is an H&R Block summary that is not part of the return; for a two-sided printer this messes up all the subsequent forms, since they get paired incorrectly.  (For the feds the summary is 2 pages so it doesn't cause a problem.)  Not too hard to work around by printing to .pdf first and then printing the first page separately, but a problem that could be easily avoided by the software.","works well, minor glitches w/state"

So that means you get 5 free Federal e-files and unlimited NYS e-files. Unlike like prior years there is no separate code email or notice, it is right on your screen for your AMAZON software library as your product code (which is really your authorization code. XXXX-XXXX)  So write that down so you can enter it right away in the program the first time it prompts you.  This year the program worked quite smoothly for me but the reason why I did not give 5 stars is that the State section could be more informative with more help. It has always been that way. I always buy this program thorough AMAZON because not only is the price good, but the download remains in your library in case you need it again.  H&R Block makes various versions every year which is confusing. This one is DELUXE with Federal AND State (first State included) AND e-filing.

I have been using H&R Block's software for years now. I have stuck with it because I haven't had any issues with the program itself, and it seamlessly loads in the previous years return.

I probably fall somewhere in the middle ground when it comes to filing status.  I am married, my wife and I both work full time,(some of it from a home office) we have one child, own a home, have retirement accounts etc. Loading our previous years information is a big help, it instantly adds things like our 2008 homebuyer credit. (which we owe Uncle Sam $500 every year for) It also does the heavy lifting determining whether to do a standard or itemized deduction.

Adding deductions such as medical expenses, child care, home office, travel expenses is straightforward. Our new HVAC system was also eligible for a energy savings credit this year.  Upon completion, it checks your entire return for errors and will not let you e-file before you address/correct them, a nice feature.

I also used the state portion of the program (MD).  This is a breeze as it already has the majority of the information needed from your federal return with only a few additional questions.  Take note that at least in our state, E-filing is NOT free. You will need either a CC, bank account or a portion of your federal return (if you have one) to e-file.

A few things to note:

1. Loading your previous years taxes is ONLY compatible if you have used H&R's SOFTWARE in the previous year. You will not be able to import from another program such as Turbo Tax, or any of the free online filings, including as of this writing, H&R's own website.

2. Remember that its up to you add in all of your potential deductions! You'd be surprised what you can deduct.  The program doesn't spell that out for you in black & white. If your not sure, HIRE A PROFESSIONAL!

46370,4,H&R Block,54.0,"01 30, 2016","I have been using H&R block software for years.  It imports my information from year to year and allows me to edit the information for the particular tax year.  Overall it is user friendly and it seems to get better each year that I use it.  Previously I was self-employed, and the schedule C form was what made me a fan.

With the 2015 edition, I had one significant usability complaint.  I entered in my W2 data and it showed I owed money until I got to the question where I had to verify I had health insurance through my employer.  I was frustrated because I thought I had added the current value of my deductions correctly.  What I would have liked is that it defaulted to ""yes"" for health insurance until I got to that question had to specifically change it.

I like the accuracy check feature as well, but sometimes these are carryovers from the previous year that need to be deleted.  It would be helpful if it deleted carryover items from the previous year that were now set to ""zero"" rather than leaving them in and flagging them later when the return is complete.

Finally, my one other usability suggestion would be a running list of issues to the left so you could jump to them rather than working through every wizard.

In contrast, I tried the free online version of Turbo Tax because it said it had form 1040A.  However, I went all the way to the end and it would not let me itemize until I paid a little more than what I just paid for H&R block. This made it easy... I killed the return, bought the software I knew, and had my taxes filed in 45 minutes for both state and federal.",Gets better each year.

Finally was able to get my state's download. Also, I finally found where the difference in amount between 2014 and 2015 versions. It was hidden in Obamacare tax penalty. Some how, the software defaults to assume everyone in the family do not have adequate health care insurance. This is a weird assumption. But that was the reason the 2015 software was showing that I owed so much more.

I'm updating my rating from 1 star to 4 stars - because of buggy UI (Q&A screens not showing up occasionally and you have to restart the step-by-step process by clicking on the topic section) and this confusion of assuming everyone didn't meet Obamacare requirements.

46415,4,H&R Block,60.5,"01 3, 2016","I've been using TaxCut (now H&R Block Tax Software) every year since 1991.  I have found the program to be consistently reliable and easy to use.  By this stage, it's a fairly stable, well-tested product that has varied very little over recent years.  There have been a few cosmetic, look-and-feel changes from year to year, and a few changes in the post-entry ""tax planning"" analyses and filing details, but the 2015 program essentially functions pretty much the same as the 2005 or the 2000 version.

There are several long-time frustrations that I've hoped would have been improved long before now, but I see no improvements in the 2015 version .  Block obviously sees little financial incentive for the competitive improvement of the mechanics of its product (as distinct from, say, promises of audit support and providing an online, cloud-based version).  I don't know how TurboTax deals with these same features, but the things that bug me most about the program are:

The treatment of ""itemized lists""
In any numerical cell, one can create an ""itemized list"" to store further details about the derivation of that particular entry.  Originally, the program would keep track of which particular list is associated with which entry cell (an obvious convenience), but TaxCut did away with that feature 15+ years ago.  Now, one needs to give each list a clearly identifiable name (e.g., ""1099-DIV *stock symbol* line 1a""), because when one wants to open a list prepared earlier for a specific cell, a full list of your names for all of your itemized lists appears and one needs to select from among them.  For returns with a large number of itemized lists, this is clunky, time-consuming, and shouldn't be necessary.  And for 2015 (for the first time), it appears that the program no longer retains the itemized lists from the previous year's return . . . an additional inconvenience.

Chronic problems that never get fixed
When one has a large number of different 1099 or K-1 income reports, the program sometimes appears to muddle them up, bringing up the data for a different investment than the one you have asked to inspect.  I haven't really identified systematically the circumstances under which this occurs, but I will typically encounter it at least once (and often several times) each year.  Relatedly, it would be a significant (and I suspect, easy) improvement to allow one to reorder lists of 1099s . . . but that never happens.

All in all, a generally reliable product that, most years, has garnered higher ratings in the independent reviews than its major competitors . . . but I do wish that one year Block would invest in fixing the long-term user irritations.","Reliable, competitively well-rated . . . but another year with the same chronic irritations"

46446,4,H&R Block,60.5,"04 13, 2016","I finished filing my 2015 Federal and state income tax returns a few days ago. As I have done for the past six years, I used H&R Block Tax Software Premium Edition. I use this software because it fills my needs completely, and is easy for me to use and understand (especially given the inherent complexity and difficulty involved in filing any U.S. tax return.)

I especially like the H&R Block Tax Software Premium Edition because it uses a relatively simple question-and-answer interview technique. This allows me to insert my data into simple on-screen forms. The program, in turn, transcribes my data onto the appropriate electronic IRS forms. The questions asked by the H&R Block software are all written in simple, straightforward language. A comprehensive, context-based help system provides background explanations for nearly every possible situation a tax return preparer may face. There are also links to various IRS publications for return preparers who may need to refer to them.

This year, it took me about six hours to complete both my Federal and state returns. That is actually a relatively short time for me, considering the complexity of my returns and the large volume of data I must enter into the program. My  H&R Block Tax Software Premium Edition took me through the entire interview process, and after I completed my returns, it automatically checked my work for errors and potential red flags.

Bottom line: by using  H&R Block Tax Software Premium Edition, I was able to make sure that my returns were completely accurate, and my tax refunds were the largest possible allowed by law. Recommended.",H&R Block Tax Software Premium Edition fills my tax preparation needs completely.

This program identifies a problem, or possible error, and just dumps the user on the form (and no more nice interface.. but typing directly into the IRS forms).

Before you can efile it makes you create a signature file, which I did.
Then I attempted to create the eFiles. It came up with errors, LIFO was selected and then you need a form to fill out, which it should have done along the way. I unchecked it and the error stuck. I have a sub chapter S Corp and it also wanted me to fill in the Income(Profit and Loss) which it should have also done along the way. No matter what value I put in the field it wouldn't stick. When I recreated the eFiles it came up with the same set of errors. The other error that came up was unable to create the eFiles because the signature wasn't attached. It never asked me to attach it anywhere.

I'm posting a review before my purchase this year because I couldn't help but notice that Amazon seems to be trying to generate consumer bias for specific tax software bundles that benefit Amazon, and that's not so cool. The only versions of the H&R Block's tax software available as a download this year are those that include the Amazon 10% Refund Bonus Offer (i.e. if you use a portion of your refund to purchase Amazon gift cards, they will tack on ""up to"" 10% more); and in the case of the Deluxe Federal Only version, the one with the Amazon tie-in costs less as well ($24.97 versus $29.95 at the time of this review).

If you already planned to spend your refund on Amazon gift cards, that's a great deal, but this marketing method tries to sway you to do so whether you'd intended to or not. Sure, you can get the downloadable version and choose not to take advantage of the gift card bonus when it comes up in the tax prep dialogue, but who's going to pass up that carrot once it is there in your face?

Problem occurred when I changed my response from yes to no in regards to a IRA. 1st case I said yes to the IRA and then entered the amount in the next screen. Then I went back and said no to the IRA... The program kept the amount as the deduction. I couldn't remove the deducted amount. I asked for online assistance.  He didn't know how to remove the amount either. I figured it out myself while I was online with the assistant, you have to say yes to the IRA and then the next screen appears and you can change the amount, which in this case was zero.

It's also sometimes necessary to open form spreadsheets and make changes the program doesn't foresee, but at least it's possible to do that; to get under the hood and tweak where needed.

After installing it, I found out that it is illegal in my state (NY) for tax preparation software providers to charge extra for state e-filing (!).

46667,4,HRBB9,81.32,"03 31, 2014","One of the most overlooked deductions people miss is the Sales Tax Deduction.
As it implies, sales tax is what your state and city hit you with on nearly every purchase you make.
The IRS has a handy online calculator that takes a minute to find out what your sales deduction is and nearly everyone qualifies.
Of course, If you saved your receipts throughout the year, you can add up the total amount of sales taxes you actually paid and claim that amount. You saved all of your receipts, right?  If not, use the calculator.
Just Google ""2013 Sales Tax Deduction Calculator"".
Unfortunately, H&R Block doesn't make this overly easy.
The simplest method I found was to open your return....click ""Forms"" in the tool bar....select ""Open Forms""....select the radio button ""Show All Forms""  and double click on ""Schedule A"".  Now go to Line 5 and enter your local and state sales tax rates and make sure to put an X in the General Sales Taxes box. Sounds harder than it really is.
This sales tax deduction goes away next year so might as well take advantage of it.
The H&R software itself downloaded fine and installed without a hitch. I did not uninstall 3 previous versions I had on the PC.
I wouldn't recommend the Deluxe edition if you trade stocks or mutual funds, for that you're better off with the Premium edition.
At time of installation, the program gave me the option to upgrade to Premium for $20 but I declined.

This software is pretty consistent, and is just as good as Turbo Tax. The main selling point over TT is price - you can usually find this package discounted well before TT goes on sale, and they do the same function. I've used both, and can't say that one has yielded better results than the other. For the basic filer, or for the filer with advanced tax knowledge, this software is adequate. If you're unsure how to get your tax info into the software, don't understand all your forms, etc and have the funds to do so, go to a reputable CPA. Don't waste your time with the tax prep guys you only see and hear about during tax season (such as Jackson Hewitt, or any of the fly-by-night vendors that might pop up in your local store/shopping center from January - April).",does the job - solid software

It can be scary if you are used to having someone do it, but I've never had the government complain and it leaves a proper trail of paperwork if I did need to respond to an inquiry.

I don't dread doing my taxes, since it doesn't take long once I get my W-2 from my employer and the little other paperwork that I need.  It is also surprisingly quick.  Once you answer their questions, it's automatic.  If you want to e-flle and have a refund directly deposited into your bank account, be aware that you may run into some extra fees.  I always have.  That is one thing that I can criticize them for.  After paying for the software, there is always some other fee or two that makes filing at least a little more expensive.

Is this software superior to the competitors?  Unless it has a specific form that they lack, not really.  The main competitors in this space are all similar if you have a standard straightforward income and deductions.  It partly comes down to the interface, which I prefer in the H&R Block software.","Easy, Fast, and Convenient"

    H&R Block",80.99,"04 15, 2014","We've been using H&R Block software for years - started back when it was TaxCut.  We have always found it to be an easy, intuitive way to do the taxes.  It downloads data from previous years to cut your actual data entry considerably.  We have 2 rental properties and using the Premium version allows an easy, complete way to track the properties from purchase, through renovation, through yearly entry. The interview guides you through each step in the process.  I have never expected the software to be able to answer all of my questions. I purchased a rental property management book to teach me the various ways to set up a property, the differences between categories of repair, renovation, etc.  Once you understand those basics, the software becomes intuitive. Don't expect the software to teach you the fundamentals of your business.  I've had the same experience in the stock sale, incentive options, non-qualified stock options, etc.  I've had tax situations that have baffled the IRS agents I've called.  The software won't answer all those questions, but it will allow you to quickly input the information and report it once you have all the relevant information on hand. It WILL alert you to tax situations that you are unfamiliar with.  This is the beauty of the program. You don't know what you don't know you don't know.  The interview process will help you to realize that you need to do more research about transactions you have done over the course of the year.

    H&R Block",80.99,"04 11, 2014","I used TT last year, and had nothing but problems on a rental conversion.  I ended up having to do my taxes mostly manual (but still had to pay for the software), since there were bugs in the software (again, referring to turbo tax premium version for rental income).  I used this HRB product this year, and it all worked flawlessly.  I had no bugs, no problems, and I filed from start to finish in about 3 hours for federal, and 15 mins for state.

I should mention that I'm an auditor/accountant myself (although NOT a tax accountant), so I'm not completely clueless when it comes to doing taxes.  Also, I spent hours on the internet researching how to handle rental property correctly LAST year (e.g. calculating basis and depreciation, etc), so this year all I had to do was plug in some of the same numbers as 2012, and add in expenses for 2013 and I was done.

I like that this software isn't ""tax software for dummys"" - i.e. it lets me easily access and view the forms (TT seems to hide everything from me, as if to make it more ""user friendly"")

The final filing/paying (yes, I owed - boo!) process with this software was SUPER easy.  Directions were great, and that's coming from someone who hates to read/follow directions!  I will get this again next year for sure.",So much better than Turbo Tax!

I bought it through amazon, downloaded the software and simply used it as I have before. The price was unbeatable! The difference between using the downloaded software and using the program straight from the H&R Block website is that if you use the website, it will store your personal information and automatically upload it from year to year. That is helpful because you only have to make minor changes in your taxes from year to year, unless you have major changes in your life that have different tax implications that is. Using the program, I had to re-enter my personal information again but that was certainly not a deal breaker.

Great Product. I like H&R Block.

 It does the familiar Q&A, walking you through your return, and allows you to skip around in case you're waiting for info to file your final return.

 I have a pretty complex return...a 10-page Schedule D with many short option sales, and a K-1 from a Canadian oil trust (with foreign taxes and a funky tax shelter reporting form). Taxcut handled the whole shebang last year without a problem (although going through the trades was tedious, even after importing them from MSFT Money). Moreover, I got an amended K-1 on March 30 (thanks a lot!!) and had to file a 1040X amended return...Taxcut handled that with no problems either.

 This year I did a pro forma return at the end of December to check the consequences of tax-lot selling...Taxcut ate it right up without a hitch, showing me how I could trim over $10K off this year's bill by selling some stock that tanked. Without doing the pro forma, I'd be making many guesses and assumptions on Excel.

 I gave it 5 stars because it's a great value for the money. If you expect this to perform as well as the Premium editions, with all their bells and whistles and free extras, you'll be disappointed. This is a bare-bones product...you get what you pay for. It is *WELL* worth the bargain price, and a must-buy over its more expensive competitor.

I have also always done my own taxes, without need of any software. Except, I graduated from school, got married, and bought a condo (took out a mortgage), started paying back student loans. So the taxes were going to be a lot more complicated this year, and I decided to give the software a try.

I was very pleasantly surprised by how easy taxes were using Tax Cut (both the State and Federal versions). Basically, I answered the questions the software asked, and the forms complete themselves. When you first run the software, it checks online to download the latest forms (which are available now). Just enter the information to answer the questions. There were also a few deductions I was not aware of in previous years when I did the taxes myself. In a couple of hours, my wife and I were done; printed the forms out, and very happy with the returns we will receive.

I haven't tried TurboTax to compare. But for a first time user, I find no fault with TaxCut at all. It seems both complete, and was certainly easy to use.","Great product, made me a believer"

I also found the questions extremely helpful in figuring out which college tuition deductions I should take advantage of. The questions I think are the best thing Tax Cut does. If you have any doubts about what kind of deductions to take, or if you're eligable for those deductions, the questions are a very easy way that the software gives you to work through your doubts and understand why or why not you're eligable for certain things on your taxes.

One caviat I would put on my review though is that I have an extremely simple return. I don't have investment income, etc. Perhaps the program does not work as well for more complicated returns and that's what other reviewers are griping about, but for a simple return where all the data entry you do is from your W-2 forms and maybe one additional form like a 1099-T, Tax Cut works great!",A great product!

I've used TaxCut for about 5-6 years and I've never had a problem with it.  I like the way it runs through the various parts of the return and forms and I've always found it logical and pretty easy to navigate and make changes.

And for what it's worth, none of the federal forms are final until Jan 31.  It's rare that things are changed after they release them in late-Dec or early Jan, but they are officially drafts until Jan 31.  So it's not surprising to have the program stall you until a finalized form is ready.

If you want to file your taxes in January, you are going to have to fill our the forms manually, the software companies (both TaxCut and Turbo Tax) have to finish their final programming after the IRS releases the final rules.

Moving on.  I have used TaxCut now for 6 or 7 consecutive years.  Every year it gets easier to use.  I don't have easy taxes either.  I own 5 rental homes and have to deal with all the write-offs and depreciation.  TaxCut has been a great help to me.  I would recommend it to anyone.","Excellent product, year after year"

64258,5,H&amp;R Block,45.5,"02 9, 2005","I've used Taxcut to file my taxes since 1996 but this was my first year using Taxcut for Mac.  I wanted to get it over with right away so I got the download version of the program and it whizzed through my taxes in no time.

There is an update pending it states on the update screen but I didn't run into any issues and was able to e-file my return.  If anything in the update affects me (and I don't believe it will because they have always disabled filing before if that was the case) I can always amend.

The forms for my records printed perfectly has usual on my laser printer and yet another year is taken care of with little headache or worry.  I heartily recommend this version because if you go on over to TurboTax you'll see just about as many complaints.  If you have a complex return you might run into issues but if your return is straightforward as mine was you should have no problems.

Yes, the state edition isn't ready but that is to be expected -- 50 different entities to work out all the programming with, the state program is always a challenge for BOTH companies to get out on time.  I have no problems waiting a couple of weeks until it is to put the state taxes to bed given the amount of time Taxcut will save me in doing that.

64259,5,H&amp;R Block,45.5,"11 29, 2004","I switched from TurboTax 2 years ago. The main reason being the issues with spyware in the PC version of that program. I also didn't like all of the hoops they were trying to make their customers jump through. Or the fact that they charge a 25% higher premium price for the Mac version of their software.

Using TaxCut was a decent experience. The program itself is easy to use and negotiate. Jumping back and forth in the return was a fairly simple process. There were significant improvements over the previous year's version. Which is always a welcome thing.

I was able to quickly import my tax info from the previous year's TurboTax files without any problem. The user interface is easily understandable. Overall, TaxCut seems to be a step or two behind TurboTax. But the end results are the same, a tax refund which more than pays for the program. And those steps behind are small steps.

Keep in mind that the ""free"" state version (which you have to pay for and get reimbursed), and any rebates, require that you send in receipts within 30 days of the purchase. If you don't then you'll not be getting any rebates or reimbursements.",Switched from TurboTax and never going back.

Another is that the simplest addition, called Premium, is more than adequate for reporting a Schedule C small business as well as stock income.

I prepare my receipts year-round in a spreadsheet. At the end of the year, that spreadsheet has all my small business transactions in one place. I sort the spreadsheet by category and manually type in SUM commands. I also keep a folder on my hard drive and scan donation receipts and other tax items for the year to that folder.

Having the categories already subtotaled and all my receipts in one place, I make two passes: the first pass takes about an hour to enter all my information and figure out ""what the damages are."" The second pass is looking for errors and omissions, and updating information. The program's ""go to"" feature makes this quick.

So in two hours, I'm done. And electronic filing is included!

64321,5,H&R Block,90.99,"02 5, 2006","I have used both Turbotax and TaxCut in the last few years and find this years' version of TaxCut equal to any version of Turbotax I have used.

I'm an accountant and CPA and found that TaxCut covered all of the complex tax situations that I encountered.  I had used Turbotax in the prior year and found the import of last years information very quick and easy.  However, it did not carry over the depreciable basis or depreciation method for my depreciable assets.

I did my return in pieces, entering info as I recieved it, so I did not go through the interview in a step by step fashion.  This created some bumps when trying to go back and make sure I had all data complete.  Taxcut did have a nice graphic to show completed data versus unentered data, but there was no programmed check to make sure that all information was in.

The only real area that I encountered a possible tax error was in the state sale tax deduction.  First of all, it did not make it clear that I could take sales tax as a deduction.  It should make that very clear for states that have sales tax in place of a state income tax.  When I finally found the input screen it asked for my local tax rate.  When I put in the rate, my deduction was extremely high.  I went back to the calculation page and realized it already had the statewide rate, but just wanted the additional locality rate on top of that.  That was confusing and could have created an error if I had not investigated.  And if I did not deal with tax rates in my day to day job, I may have not input the correct rate.

The only other issue I had was with printing a draft return.  They should give you the option of printing a return to review before e-filing.  Trying to get the pages I wanted to print was somewhat of a pain.  And DON'T PRINT THE WORKSHEETS.  They print out funky looking and it gives you pages of information you don't want.

A plus was they actually email you when the IRS has accepted your electronic filing, rather than having to go back to the return and check as I have had to do with Turbotax in the past.

Overall, however, I was pleased with the product.  And given the free e-filing and the price savings over Turbotax, I'll definitely use Taxcut in the future.",Just as good as Turbotax

This walked me through my federal and state tax forms very easily, and helped me find every last deduction that was possible to apply. The ""Interview"" style of the questions were clear and easy to understand, and the program makes it easy to flip back and forward in case you missed something, or the program finds an error on a tax form.

Everything is laid out for you and at your finger tips. The Help Guide is easy to understand, the forms included are plentiful, and all information is updated. You can update as you go along, or update the entire program upon install. The latter worked great for me. The program will still ask you to update a few times. But just skip it. If you click update you will just get a message saying the program is fully updated. I clicked once just to be sure. I was good. Great deal.

I live in California and couldn't file electronically because according to the program the state does not allow e filing for returns with addresses more then 30 characters long. Mine has only 25, but still no go. Unless they mean the entire address, city included. Which would seem weird. But it's really not a problem because the forms print out perfectly and ready to go, so I can just send them in. And this year I owe the state $5, so the $15.95 charge to e file would of exceeded my tax debt. So better to send it snail mail, anyway.

The federal portion was e filed no problem, and the program assures you every step of the way that everything is official and secure. Which is good for peace of mind. It's $15.95 to file and an additional $12.95 for the third party service that actually does the filing. But one federal e file rebate is included with the package. So my final cost for e filing was just $12.95. If you e file state it will be $15.95 more. Still a pretty good deal. And MS Money Standard is included by mail in coupon.

Pick this up, actually read the Help file at the end of the federal and state install (it addresses many of the issues some of these people are complaining about) and get your taxes done right.

I compared TurboTax and several other offerings, and I've looked at more recent web-based offerings. TaxCut is still the gold standard - and the Deluxe version is more than sufficient.

The interviews in TaxCut have always been more thorough, covering areas and aspects that TurboTax didn't touch. I remember speaking with a lawyer friend who was filing with TurboTax and frustrated that it didn't cover a number of real estate areas. I was able to quickly find those parts of the TaxCut interview, and read him both the questions and parts of the various (and easily searchable) help files and ""tax tips"".

The Deluxe version covers some areas that have been important to our finances at various times, including home office deductions for example. The premium adds topics and features we didn't need, and you may not either. (For example, even the basic version's help files are extensive; the Kiplinger videos, or whatever they're adding to Premium now, are unnecessary - and will just draw out the amount of time you spend filing.)

All that said, I almost gave the 2005 version only 4 stars because some of the functions seem to have slipped. For example, ""safe deposit box"" no longer appears in the searchable index. And it took more effor than usual to find the place to enter real estate taxes paid.

This year though, I purchased the deluxe + state version and e-filed myself. With all of the rebates, you couldn't go wrong. I got a rebate for my federal return, which made the cost of e-filing only $15.95 total. I also got a version of Microsoft Money 2006 for free after another rebate. So all in all, I feel like I paid $9.00 for the program and $15.95 for e-filing the state return, and the price was right. Oh, and I forgot - I also got Deduction Pro, which I had never used before but it was great. I used it for my 2005 return, and now I'm entering information for 2006 to make my next year's return even easier! This was one great bargain, and I'd do it again next year.",What a great bargain
64353,5,H&R Block,94.6533333333333,"02 9, 2006","This is the 3rd year that I have used TaxCut software, and this is by far the easiest version.  I experienced none of the technical problems reported by some other reviewers below.  The software loaded perfectly on my Win XP machine, and I was able to complete and e-file both my federal and state returns in my spare time over the weekend.  With the e-file refund, and the free $15 gift card I got when I purchased at Circuit City, I couldn't be more pleased.",Gets Better Every Year
64354,5,H&R Block,94.6533333333333,"02 7, 2006","I check these reviews each year, and noticed the issues that some people stated intalling this software.  I know my way around a PC, but this software installed and updated with ZERO issues, and seems to be running fine (I'll try and update this review later). I installed it on Windows XP.  I've looked around the web and do not see any issues with spyware or anything else with this software.  Considering the fact that electonic federal file was included, and it's cheaper than the competitor, I went with taxcut this year.  I've switched before, and this imports turbotax files, so why not?  Note that when installing ANY software, I always exit any applications and close anything besides virus software ( I run antivir and microsoft beta ) by right clicking the icons in my system tray in the lower right hand corner.  A good idea is to also set a system restore point if you're running windows XP previous to loading.  Enjoy!!!",No Problem Installing
64355,5,H&R Block,94.6533333333333,"02 6, 2006","I used to use TurboTax.  About six years ago, I was at a discount office retailer and TaxCut was cheaper, so I purchased that instead and found it did the same thing and very well.

I used to run Windows 95 and now have Windows XP.  I've never had a bit of trouble installing TaxCut software on my home computer.  Those who do have trouble might be running Windows 2000 -- it's known that some software just won't run on Windows 2000.  I've heard Windows 98 might have similar issues.

What I can tell you is that TaxCut 2005 installs and runs without a hitch on Windows XP.

As to ease of use, it's pretty darned easy.  The ""Deluxe"" version probably won't do it for people who are running a business, but it works quite well for those of us who work for an employer and, even though I rent an apartment, all the questions were there for those paying a mortgage so that all itemizable deductions willl be accounted for.

Once you install the software, you do have to use your Internet connection to update it.  It's not hard to understand why.  The IRS and every state income tax agency (California's Franchise Tax Board in my case) has last-minute changes to forms and even to regulations.  The software will be released on CD-ROM and there will be last-minute changes that TaxCut will need to download via the Internet.  Once that step has been completed, you're good to go.

Once all the Federal tax return data has been input by the user in response to various questions asked by the software, TaxCut will automatically transfer applicable data to the user's state return.  That leaves very few questions to answer to get the state tax return done.

The software will automatically compare the standard deduction versus itemized deductions to determine which will produce a greater refund and go the better route.

I note the 2005 version includes all the one-time special deductions available for people who contributed to Hurricane Katrina relief as well as for those who suffered losses in 2005's major hurricanes.

My one complaint -- a small one -- is that TaxCut kept directing me to update the software via the Internet, even though I'd already done it.  After a couple of red herrings where I said, yes, do the update, I determined that all udpates had already been accomplished and at future redundant prompts, I told it not to.

I didn't opt to file electronically because I'm not going to pay the IRS $15.95 for the privilege of making its workload easier.  I filed on paper, the old fashioned way, via mail.  Therefore, I can't tell you how well electronic filing with TaxCut works.

But I'm very happy with this product and will continue to use it.",Excellent and easy to use

I used to do my taxes on my own, but I purchased a home in the past year, and knew I would need assistance figuring out how to enter all the correct information.  This made everything very easy - took me through all of the required information step by step, and then submitted my return through e-file automatically.  I am also glad for the e-file rebate.

64360,5,H&R Block,94.6533333333333,"12 23, 2005","I have been using the Taxcut Deluxe version for the past seven years and have extremely happy with it.  When I started using it seven years ago I doubted I could prepare my own tax return without making any mistakes, so for the first two years I had my sister, a licensed CPA and CFO, review my returns after I prepared them with Taxcut.  She not only verified that everything was correct, but she noticed that Taxcut calculated items that she would have overlooked, since she was managing a corporate accounting department and was not preparing personal returns anymore.  After those first two years, I have not had her review my returns and she started using Taxcut to prepare her own. My father, also a licensed CPA and retired CFO, was using Turbotax to prepare his personal returns and was becoming frustrated with it.  He switched to Taxcut a few years ago when he heard about Turbotax installing [...]and he decided he didn't want to hassle with it anymore.  In addition, he was filing state returns in two states and Taxcut state allowed him to do that at no additional charge.  Between the three of us, Taxcut has worked without any errors and we have had no problems using or installing it.  [...]

This year, I have already imported my files from last year and have begun to plan my tax return.  It only took a few minutes to install both the federal and state programs and import my files from last year, which I had backed up on CD.  I am currently using it to plan my tax liability for this year and will be prepared to file as soon as my wife and I receive our W2's and year-end statements from our investments.  I haven't used Deduction Pro in the past, but I did install it this year since it was in the box and I figured I would see how it worked.  My wife and I make donations every year and never thought they were worth much.  Not thinking there was much value to any of the items we donated, I itemize just a few, so far, and it looks like they were worth more than I thought.  I will definitely be itemizing all of our donations this year.

I give Taxcut five stars because it's easy to install, easy to use, and simple to back up and uninstall when you are finished using it.  Most importantly, it accurately calculates your taxes.",Happy User for Many Years

Before you switch from Tax Cut, compare the prices:  they want $45 for Fed+State; Tax Cut wants $30.  NEITHER product includes free filing for tax year 2006.

Macintosh support from Tax Cut (apparently missing last year) is back, and others have reviewed it under this product.

Current Turbo Tax users (tax year 2006) are reporting that they are unable to import from prior-year Tax Cut, nor do the Turbo Tax specs say they can.

If you are installing Turbo Tax on a Windows 98 machine, your installation will immediately abort & it will print out instructions for mailing the product back to them for a refund in 8 weeks.

Footnote/suggestion for those wanting to save money: Just buy the basic package, then file on paper; if you file paper in February/March, before the rush, your refund comes back in about 10 days--almost as fast as with e-file. Then do your state return by hand: most state returns are a page or two with numbers taken right off the federal form; just use your prior-year return as a guide if you get stuck.",Let's not all rush to Turbo-Tax just yet

The catch as always as if you lived in 2 states, you have to get to 2 state programs via download (and the second will cost extra).  2 kickers to be aware of this year however. 1) It appears this time you can't get your first state (the one that comes as bought) until you are ready to process your state return. 2) The CD with the free e-file is now sold as a separate identity, if you wanna e-file using this version, you have to pay for it during installation. By the way speaking of paying on installation, H&R Block is mailing copies out to people who registered the software in past years (they did this last year as well).  These mailed out copies are NOT free.  You have to pay for them on installation.  Fortunately, they email you a ""receipt"" with an ""activation code"" so if you have to uninstall and reinstall the disc, you don't have to pay again, just insert the cd and enter the code.  Still and all, I have been using this since it has come our I think in 2000, and it is as always user friendly and a lot less expensive than Turbotax.

One year I decided to go into H&R and have them do it, thinking that they might be able to save me some money, but all they did was input the data like had done for years.

I was annoyed... I'm a single adult that rents and they did not go through any routes (deductions) that could have saved me anything.

Even if you own property, or a small bussiness, all the downloaded information is there and the help files explain everything....

What is even a better, compared to using the written form, as you follow thru the form... the computer automatic skips the sections that you don't need.  As you answer the questions, you wind your way thru the complicated process of filing.

However, after reading some of the reviews I was was a bit worried about going back to it. Since I had to use that other software last year and was not happy with it, I called TaxCut support to see if they had worked out some of the issues sighted in the reviews. I must have sounded unconvinced because a supervisor who happened to be listening in contacted me about my concern, assured me that many of the eaerlier issues had been addressed and offered a free copy (note full disclosure)in order to convince me that the issues had been addressed and the product was even better than the earlier versions.

In short, I have finished my taxes and am very happy with the TaxCut experience.

Aside from a small glitch with the updating, Taxcut was extremely easy to use. The support team walked me through the updating issue, so that was easy as well.

The look and feel of TaxCut was intuitive and easy to navigate. The questions and explanations were clear. The tips were informative. If I found I was missing some important data it was easy to continue and return to the uncompleted form later.

I hope they don't stop making the Mac version again because it is a real pain to switch between TaxCut and that other software. I also hope they will make it possible in future editions to import data from business software like Quickbooks or MYOB.

I think the 2007 software is better (the problem described above is fixed).  I used to use Turbo Tax, but they got too pricey.  HR Block is about where Turbo Tax was in looks three years ago, so they are catching up fast.  I was impressed with Turbo back then, so I'm fine with HR Block being a bit less behind with bells and whistles but costing less and throwing in free e-filing.  It also includes their program Deduction Finder, something that can save you $$$ if you use deductions, and also you get some free time with HR Block tax specialists if necessary.

I am not gifted in math or tax law, and I find this program very easy to use.  The questions are to the point, and the help feature actually answers most of my questions.  I showed this to my Dad, who likes to do his taxes by hand himself, and he is actually considering purchasing it.  Even if he doesn't, just considering it is a strong endorsement as far as I'm concerned.

For those concerned about the price, check each day.  I've seen the discounted price go as low as 49.99, but it changes on a daily basis.  Some of the amazon sellers have gone as low as 32.00, too.  The comparable TurboTax Premier Federal + State 2007 costs $67.99 and does not include e-filing or the separate program, Deduction Finder.

Bottom line is that it gets the job done, is backed by HR Block (they also throw in some audit protection for free), and it costs less than Turbo Tax.

TurboTax and TaxCut for the first time are now the same price and this year I was tempted to go back to TurboTax to see if it was better, but decided I am too happy with TaxCut to switch.

64473,5,H&R Block,100.5,"01 26, 2008","I've used TaxCut since 2003 and the 2007 version was just as easy to use as the previous versions.  The only negative I found was that the software had to do a huge software update immediately, which really was not TaxCut's fault since the government decided to change a bunch of tax rules just before the end of year.

We also used the Deduction Pro for the 1st time this year and the refund savings generated from its use more than paid for the tax software.  My wife and I donate a substantial amount of both monetary gifts and non-monetary gifts to charity.  While monetary donations' tax write-offs are no brainers we've been severely underestimating non-monetary donations' values.  Deduction Pro helped us identify our errors and in turn generated a few hundred dollars more on our return - nothing substantial in the big picture, but there is no reason to just give the government free money.

I also like that TaxCut now offeres an e-file package.  Since I'm going to pay $30 to e-file anyway ($15 for federal, $15 for state), paying the cost up-front is very convenient.  At Amazon's prices, the software really only cost me less than $30 when you take into account the e-file costs.

If we had simple taxes and only had to file a 1040-EZ, there is no way I would spend $$$$ on TaxCut software and e-file (it's too bad they don't offer a basic version anymore), but since we have to file a 1040 with dozens of supporting IRS forms, this software makes sense for us.",Another Version that does a good job serving its purpose

I was finished in about 15 minutes, and we file as married, joint income, and we itemize deductions.

This product is backed by H&R Block, the leader in the tax industry. You can even call a tax professional and ask a question at no charge if you get stuck. You also receive free audit assistance if needed. You may be able to find cheaper but is it really worth it? Especially if  there is a risk of security? I think not. An accountant, by the way is just that...an accountant, not a tax professional. I've used this company for the past 10 years.",You get what you pay for
64477,5,H&R Block,100.5,"12 16, 2007","I used this product last year and it worked fine except for one minor glitch.  That problem had to do with inputting my initial contact information (name, address, etc.)  The program would not allow you to use the delete button.  You could get past this, and everything else worked fine.  No problem with State or electronic filing.

I think the 2007 software is better (the problem described above is fixed).  I used to use Turbo Tax, but they got too pricey.  HR Block is about where Turbo Tax was in looks three years ago, so they are catching up fast.  I was impressed with Turbo back then, so I'm fine with HR Block being a bit less behind with bells and whistles but costing less and throwing in free e-filing.  It also includes their program Deduction Finder, something that can save you $$$ if you use deductions, and also you get some free time with HR Block tax specialists if necessary.

I am not gifted in math or tax law, and I find this program very easy to use.  The questions are to the point, and the help feature actually answers most of my questions.  I showed this to my Dad, who likes to do his taxes by hand himself, and he is actually considering purchasing it.  Even if he doesn't, just considering it is a strong endorsement as far as I'm concerned.

For those concerned about the price, check each day.  I've seen the discounted price go as low as 49.99, but it changes on a daily basis.  Some of the amazon sellers have gone as low as 32.00, too.  The comparable TurboTax Premier Federal + State 2007 costs $67.99 and does not include e-filing or the separate program, Deduction Finder.

Bottom line is that it gets the job done, is backed by HR Block (they also throw in some audit protection for free), and it costs less than Turbo Tax.  So if using a product just a little behind in terms of fancy stuff is not a big deal, then I think this product will fit the bill.",More Than Meets the Eye

TaxCut assumes that you know little or nothing about income tax law.  The software will ask a number of questions and will prompt you for information based on your answers.  It will help tremendously if you gather as many of your tax documents as possible before starting.  This software is significantly cheaper than paying a service to prepare it and much easier than doing in manually.

The e-file option has been around for some years and is a great time saver for those due a refund.  If you owe money, you might want to save a few dollars and just file manually.  The program will print all the forms you need so it's easy to do and there's no real advantage to electronically filing if you're writing a check.

64510,5,H&R Block,100.5,"12 1, 2007","Once again for the 3rd year in a row, H&R Block makes their easy and more affordable than Turbotax even easier to own with the premium edition, that is, Federal and State software all on 1 disc.  Actually you download the State software from the Internet and update as need be throughout the season.  As always though if you have to file in more than 1 state, you need to buy additional downloads or perhaps additional copies of the separate State CD.  Also again, previous owners don't have to get their copy from here (Amazon) or other retailers if they don't want to as H&R Block has just started mailing out copies to previous users (I got mine yesterday).  The kicker just to remind those of you who did not properly read my review last time, the copies that come by mail from Block ARE NOT FREE. You pay for them when you install the software.  The bad news is you pay the list price, so for those of you who are hoping for a price break (Amazon's discount as I type this is only 6 bucks and Marketplace clients even lesser, assuming they are not trying to make a profit off copies they got from Block in the mail) then buy all means buy it retail, and save time.  The good news about the Block copies, you pay ONLY the list price, no sales tax or shipping.  The better news is once you pay with your favorite plastic (in a secured transaction), you get on screen and later in email a code number to save for your records as proof of purchase.  This way, if at any time you have to uninstall and reinstall the disc, you don't have to pay twice.  I believe Microsoft is starting to this with Turbo as well by the way for competition sake. Either way, whether you buy it retail or accept the copy in the mail from Block, you get a first rate program and save at least 30 bucks on the equivalent copy of Turbo.

I don't have a real complicated return.  I do itemize deductions but the most complex thing I deal with are gains and losses on sales of stocks. Even so, I HATE filling out IRS and state tax forms and HATE EVEN MORE the stupid instructions that come with them that only an idiot could have written.  So I am happy to fork over the money for TaxCut and let their much easier question interface lead me through the process, as well as let them determine if I am subject to alternative minimum tax and all these other things thrown in by slimy politicians with ulterior motives.

Several reviewers have complained about the price increase for the 2007 version and I have to agree, I am not happy either.  But considering what you pay to have someone prepare your taxes, it is still pretty reasonable. And I also find it is well worth it to let the program do my taxes instead of pulling out my hair and screaming as I try to make my way through the maze of forms and instructions that comes from the IRS or the Franchise Tax Board.

To sum up: I have never had a problem with TaxCut.  The process is very clear, there is a clean data trail that you can print out, and all of the forms print out very cleanly on my printer. I intend to purchase the 2008 program next year unless we have some serious tax reform.. so in other words, I will be buying the 2008 version next year and probably each year's version thereafter.","Works Just Fine, Like Always"

64538,5,H&R Block,100.5,"12 16, 2007","TaxCut offers individuals a powerful option for preparing an income tax return that is relatively easy to use.  TaxCut assumes that you know little or nothing about income tax law.  The software will ask a number of questions and will prompt you for information based on your answers.  It will help tremendously if you gather as many of your tax documents as possible before starting.  This software is significantly cheaper than paying a service to prepare it and much easier than doing in manually.

The e-file option has been around for some years and is a great time saver for those due a refund.  If you owe money, you might want to save a few dollars and just file manually.  The program will print all the forms you need so it's easy to do and there's no real advantage to electronically filing if you're writing a check.

Please note that this version covers both Federal and State returns.  Most people will need both, but if you live in a state with no income tax then you'll want to look at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/H-R-Block-TaxCut-2007-Premium-Federal-Win-Mac/dp/B000WPWYJS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">H&R Block TaxCut 2007 Premium Federal (Win/Mac)</a>&nbsp;for considerably less money.

If you don't itemize your deductions and have a very simple return, you might be better off preparing the forms manually on your own.  On the opposite end of the spectrum, if you have a return with major league complications, you might be better off going to a good CPA.  For everyone else, this is really a no-brainer.  It's inexpensive, easy to use, and accurate.  I've been using TaxCut for quite a few years and would not even consider giving it up.",Excellent tax tool
64539,5,H&R Block,100.5,"12 1, 2007","Once again for the 3rd year in a row, H&R Block makes their easy and more affordable than Turbotax even easier to own with the premium edition, that is, Federal and State software all on 1 disc.  Actually you download the State software from the Internet and update as need be throughout the season.  As always though if you have to file in more than 1 state, you need to buy additional downloads or perhaps additional copies of the separate State CD.  Also again, previous owners don't have to get their copy from here (Amazon) or other retailers if they don't want to as H&R Block has just started mailing out copies to previous users (I got mine yesterday).  The kicker just to remind those of you who did not properly read my review last time, the copies that come by mail from Block ARE NOT FREE. You pay for them when you install the software.  The bad news is you pay the list price, so for those of you who are hoping for a price break (Amazon's discount as I type this is only 6 bucks and Marketplace clients even lesser, assuming they are not trying to make a profit off copies they got from Block in the mail) then buy all means buy it retail, and save time.  The good news about the Block copies, you pay ONLY the list price, no sales tax or shipping.  The better news is once you pay with your favorite plastic (in a secured transaction), you get on screen and later in email a code number to save for your records as proof of purchase.  This way, if at any time you have to uninstall and reinstall the disc, you don't have to pay twice.  I believe Microsoft is starting to this with Turbo as well by the way for competition sake. Either way, whether you buy it retail or accept the copy in the mail from Block, you get a first rate program and save at least 30 bucks on the equivalent copy of Turbo.  By the way, it appears the program no longer supports Windows Me or lower, guess it's time to buy new machines for those of us without an XP or Vista computer ;-)",Taxcut Returns (pardon the pun) for 2007

I've never experienced phone support that actually went the extra mile (like 45 minutes, with no hold time) and that actually corrected the problem.  Amazing.

  (Seems the CD that shipped from Amazon was corrupt in some way and the update feature would not work. At the end of my return, the Error Check procedure refused to certify my return for E-filing because all of the forms were out-of-date.  I called their Help Desk for assistance and their support guy stayed on the phone with me for 45 minutes, trying to get the update feature to work.  In the end, we both gave up and he gave  me a free download of their latest software. The new code and forms worked like a charm and I E-filed my return.)

TaxCut now has a customer for life, more so because of the help desk support than for anything new and amazing in the software.  Let's face it -- TaxCut and TurboTax do the same thing, in pretty much the same painless way, to achieve the same result.  Neither has a serious advantage over the other.  However, one didn't try to slyly pry extra dollars out of my pocket. And the other has some truly extraordinary customer support people who are permitted wide latitude in solving their customers' problems.

64584,5,H&R Block,7.99,"01 13, 2009","This is my 4th year for using ""TaxCut"".  I have 2 small business corporations that I operate from my home office. One is on-line and the other is not.  I can do the taxes, step by step using the included guide program for each business, print out the completed forms and mail them directly to the IRS. After completing my business taxes, I go right to doing my personal family income tax. When finished, it an easy process to file the results, electronically...  right from my home computer.

The following year, the current ""TaxCut"" searches my computer for past filing records and incorporates the information that is needed into the current years program. TaxCut Home & Business is great for meeting my needs. I am comfortable using it because the guide asks simple questions and the program checks for errors when you complete inputting data.",Great Value!
64585,5,H&R Block,7.99,"01 12, 2009","I've used this program for several years.  I'm a CPA of some 10 years and I only use it for ""C"" Corporations and Trusts; maybe a few payroll tax returns.  I have other S/W for 1040s, S corps and the like.

I am dismayed to see negative ratings from those who claim injury that forms are not 100% ready by Jan 11!  My professional grade 1040 stand alone program was just supplied on the 9th!  Still waiting for 1065, 1120S.  All return SW is late this year due to Congress passing a very late, big, tax cut program just upon adjourning.

If you need a Business program, this is very good and very reasonably priced.  Beat's Turbo tax business on inclusiveness and price.",Very fine program and value; rants should be discounted
64586,5,H&R Block,7.99,"01 2, 2009","H&R Block's ""TaxCut Home and Business"" has been a great choice for me for several years, and each year they improve the product.  I ordered the 2008 version today.

This package is remarkable.  It includes software for your Form 1040 individual or joint tax return, plus programs to prepare your Corporation or S-Corp (Form 1120), Partnership (Form 1065), or Estate or Trust (Form 1041).  State returns for all these is included.  Employment tax return preparation (W-4, 1099 and so on) is also included.

For the personal return, electronic filing for federal is included (5 returns), but you will have to either mail your state return or pay a fee (reasonable by my lights) to file electronically.  I don't think electronic filing is available for the business returns.

Anyway all this is in the package.  Don't overbuy.  If you don't have one of the businesses mentioned, just get the appropriate software for 1040 returns.  But if you need to file for a business (Corp/Partn/EstTr) plus your individual return, this deal is hard to beat.

Let me end with a few cautions:

If you are buying ""TaxCut Home and Business + E-file,""  you don't need to buy ""TaxCut Premium + State + E-file.""  IT'S INCLUDED.  I mention this specifically because they seem to be marketed together on this site.

The forms to be used for this year's income tax haven't been completed by IRS.  They will be updating items during the first couple of months of 2009, and there's no way the software I'm buying today can include all of them.  So I'll need to go to the HRBlock update site a few times (the software connects and links up) to get updates from both Fed and state.

With all tax software there is a learning curve, so ""read the lines,"" think about what you're doing, allow adequate prep time, and review the results before you file.  I think you'll be pleased.

As I needed to complete both personal and corporate tax returns I purchased the Turbo Tax ""Home and Business"" product.  Upon installing the program I found it clumsy and awkward to navigate.  I also realized that to complete the corporate return I would have to buy the Turbo Tax Business program as well (the Home and Business version doesn't cover corporations!).

Needless to say, I returned Turbo Tax and went back to Tax Cut Home and Business.  I find the Tax Cut product much easier to use and navigate.

This product combines the heavy-duty business version with the appropriate personal tax version.  The software walked me through the S-Corp return clearly and concisely.  I bought several capital items this year, and had already done my depreciation and amortization calculations manually, and was surprised this software let me enter the new items, as well as previous year's purchases, let me select what depreciation method I was using, and calculated how much depreciation I had left on each capital item.  The software also let me download my state's business tax return (for free) and exported my federal data to the state return.  The only issue I had with the state return, was the ""date due"" listed on the H&R state form was different than the forms I received from my state.

64602,5,H&R Block,7.99,"04 30, 2009","Decided to try TaxCut this year because:
a. the reviews for the 2008 version of T*****Tax seemed to be rather negative (slow, bloated).
b. after April 1, I couldn't find any significant discounts (versus -$20 in March).
c. T*****Tax didn't do a good job in calculating the max contribution I could make to a Solo 401(k).
d. an Amazon vendor was offering a really great deal on the TaxCut Home & Business package.

Turns out I didn't need the Business part of TaxCut.  All the forms I needed as a self-employed filer were on the Home CD.  Switching between the interview mode and the actual forms can be a bit awkward.  The directions are reasonably clear, but sometimes hard to follow (e.g. when the directions said to click on a command keyword, I couldn't find it in any toolbar menu or tab; eventually I found the keyword link at the _bottom_ of the screen.)

The reward for choosing TaxCut was that the program applied 100% of medical insurance premiums as an Income Adjustment because I'm self-employed.  Last year T****Tax treated these premium payments as a medical deduction less the 2% income threshold.  I filed amended returns to get refunds due to this newly-discovered Income Adjustment.

TaxCut, just like the other program, seems to be unaware of the real contribution limits for Solo 401(k) plans.  You just have to ignore the bogus ""error"" warnings.

TaxCut software also wins if compared to the free on-line options. I don't like using the on-line tax programs for two reasons (1) I don't want my financial data to be on someone's web site (2) free offers include the Federal tax only.

H&R Block tax software does a good job despite having a few flaws, my two pain complaints:

1. Some forms (such foreign tax credit over the limit to be directly on 1040) require entering data manually. For some reason the software does not do this form automatically. This form is not that hard to do manually as this form does not change year to year.

2. Copy and Paste from Interview screens is not possible. Sometimes I wish to do it for some issue as a reminder to myself. My solution is to do PrintScreen (holding ctl key, shift key, and printscreen key at the same time). This generates an image of the screen, which I paste into paint or photo editing sofware which I can print or save for later.

In addition to tax software, the package includes DeductionPro software. I find it helpful in organizing and valuating charity donations, such as clothing and household items.

I had my previous year's AGI from my 2007 return, and even confirmed it by calling the IRS, but twice my return got rejected by the IRS.

  I had one issue that I used the online chat support to resolve and found the service to be excellent - it was my input error but I needed help to locate it and the agent was polite and helpful and resolved it in one fairly short session.  I will use this product again in the future.
  I do wish that the ""net cost"" of using these tools was easier to find but none of the providers seem to make that information readily available.",TaxCut 2008 Premium

64644,5,H&R Block,26.99,"04 11, 2009","I've used ChipSoft and then TurboTax for over 20 years, so it was a major decision to switch to TaxCut.  When they started charging ~$10 for every printout, that was the signal.  I calculate my son's taxes as well, so this would be rather expensive.  One son will be doing his own taxes next year, and the other the following year, so you can guess which application they'll use.
I have a moderately complex return with W2, home business, interest/dividends, capital gains, and limited partnerships.  The switch to TaxCut was much easier than I expected, and it has better coverage of partnerships.  The help section took a little effort to understand, but has worked well for most cases (and Google fills in the rest).

I almost switched to TurboTax the following year out of spite, but in the end I just went back to regular TaxCut because it was a superior product and a better value.

64648,5,H&R Block,26.99,"04 5, 2009","With one exception during the past dozen years, I've used TurboTax to do my federal and state tax returns. This year (2008 return), TurboTax changed its policies, effectively doubling the cost of what their software did on my 2007 return. So I decided to give TaxCut a try. The long and short of it is that I was most pleased and will plan to use TaxCut again next year.

About me: I am a freelance writer in Washington, DC. I have a chronic horror of tax time, because I can never find my way through the Byzantine labyrinth of tax forms and rules and regulations. I use tax-prep software, with their interview method, to avoid those horrors. Even TurboTax has occasionally carried me off into tall weeds. In those cases, I just make a wild guess at what to do, click an answer, and move on -- and probably pay a price, but who knows? I was pleasantly surprised at how simple TaxCut's interview was. I kept expecting little detours into the tall weeds, but they never came. For the first time, I e-filed my federal return (a freebie with TaxCut Premium), and it went through like a dream.

The only problem I encountered was when I tried to save my return as a PDF file. TaxCut just couldn't carry through. It tried to install some kind of PDF utility, but the install wouldn't work. I tried phoning their tech support, but they couldn't help. This, however, was a minor disappointment. Having a PDF copy of my return would have been a mere convenience. It was no trouble to print out a copy and file that for reference. I'll gladly try TaxCut again next year.","Hello TaxCut, adios TurboTax"

The reason they will never get me back again is that they tried to conceal those changes, which caused me to have to return the product after I'd bought it instead of just not buying it in the first place.  But I didn't really expect TaxCut to be as easy to use as it has been.  I imported last year's info from TurboTax without difficulty.  The entry of this year's information is just as easy as TurboTax was but, just out of personal preferences, I like TaxCut better.

I had used TurboTax for many years but each year I got tired of the embedded pitches to purchase additional products or purchase upgrades.  Also I had some problems last year with TurboTax finding correct deductions on my state form.  Finally after repeated attempts I had to manually enter the correct data.

I am totally satisfied with the performance of Tax Cut.  It is very user friendly.  It's easy to look at the forms as needed.  It easily imported all of my previous data from TurboTax and was easy to efile.

I had a question regarding one of the numbers on the 1040 form.  I called a customer service representative.  I expected to be put on hold for a long time.  Instead I was put on hold for all of 60 seconds!  The rep solved my problem immediately.

  I, like many others, switched to TaxCut from TurboTax because of the insane price increases for TurboTax.  I was very satisfied with TaxCut.  I had tried TaxCut several years ago and found the interface to be awful, and the questioning sessions to be sub-par.  TurboTax was far superior in both design layout and ease of use.

  Not any more.  I found TaxCut to be easily understood, the interface was nice, presenting the current information very clearly, while I really like the ""refund calculator"" in the upper right, as apposed to TurboTax's version on the left.  I also was very impressed with the speed at which I was able to go through the program . . . about 30 minutes from beginning to end.  I did have to wait for a software update to actually file, because a few of the forms were not finalized, but that only took a few days.

  I received my refund in a very expedient time (two days) from both the State and the Federal.

Maybe it is just me, but it does just say ""Free Federal e-file"" at the top and I immediately took this to mean there was no state e-file included. I am always out looking for a good deal and if not e-filing saves me a lot of money I will do it.

I just downloaded today, entire download and install of Taxcut 2008 took less than 5 minutes.  FYI ... I am running Windows XP Professional SP3 as OS, and my internet connection is Sprint EVDO high-speed broadband wireless (essentially over cell phone connection), so if you have a high-speed wired LAN type connection, your download may even be faster than mine.

64765,5,H&R Block,99.8,"12 26, 2009","I have used H&R Blocks tax program for many years and have always been happy with it.  This year is no exception.  It works great on my mac.  My taxes are complicated because I have rental properties (and in the past my own business as well)--but it makes preparing my taxes a breeze---and way cheaper than hiring someone.

You can choose to import data or enter all data manually.  I actually enter mine in manually as that is my preference.  (actually, to clarify, i import previous years taxes but manually enter w-2s, charitable contribution, rental income and expenses, etc)

This includes 5 free federal efiles (which isn't as good, in my opinion, as when it included 1 state and 1 federal).  The state program is included with this but if you want to efile you have to pay for that.

For anyone that has to pay state taxes in addition to federal, it is great to have the two programs.  Essentially, the state taxes are filled out by the time you get done with the federal--with the exception of a few questions that you have to answer.  You can always purchase the state later rather than getting them together, however, i have found that it is more expensive to do it that way.

If you haven't used tax software before or are new to this brand---it is super duper easy to use.  They have questions and you fill in the blanks.  You can get more information and help with any topic you need.  You can also get the actual publication information from the IRS.  Tax preparation may sound intimidating, but with a program like this it is very simple.

With H&R block you also get access to a tax advisor for free (for 1 issue)--which can be helpful and is an advantage of this vs. other brands.

In addition you get audit assistance with this if you efile--although hopefully you will never need it.

Even if you have difficult taxes, don't be scared to try this product before going to a professional.  You will most likely find that it is much easier than you think.  And H&R block offers a money back guarantee so you really have nothing to lose.

Updates are free and essentially automatic--it does ask you permission to update--but that is pretty much the extent of it.

For safety purposes I always back up my taxes to a CD AND load the tax software and my taxes on a second computer--perhaps a bit neurotic but i'd rather be safe.  It is extremely easy to do back ups.  Also, I have several years of taxes loaded onto my computer and when i switched from primarily PC's to primarily MACs i was able to transfer all of my taxes over without a problem or hassle.

Because you get 5 free efiles, you can do your friends taxes if you want to be nice.  I always register the product in my name but usually do 4 different returns.  You can also choose to print and file returns if you would like also.

Another feature I like is that i can do ""what if"" scenarios--i will go in and change numbers to see how it effects  my taxes so i can better estimate for future years.

H&R Block also will give you tips/warnings/suggestions if there are any red flags or errors on your return.

UPDATE:  as of 2/22 I have successfully efiled  3 federal and state returns.  i did not have any issues with efiling at all.  although, i realized i made an error earlier in this review because when i went to file, i realized you get audit support if you efile or paper file--as long as you used the program to help you on your taxes.",Easy to Use--Can Use with Macs and PC's

The Turbo Tax program won't by design load on another computer without purchasing another copy. Too bad for you if you have a computer crash. You still have to pay them when you file based on how many files you pay for in the package.  Turbo Tax costs more than the H&R.
 H&R is user friendly.  You can load your last year tax information from other tax preparations programs without a problem.  If you a first time user just take your last years file and fill in the information using your new data.  It's not that hard.  If you have a question give them a call.  There is a lot of support on line as well.
 The H&R program is performing smoothly again this year.  I file personally a tax return of at least 27 pages.  I had a high end tax accountant do my taxes years ago.  It was expensive.  They made mistakes. That meant not only was my federal return messed up but then the state started sending me letters for years.  The last straw was when they called me up on Easter and said they said they couldn't finish my taxes on time to file tomorrow even though they had my well organized data 8 weeks ago.
 My sister was blind and a tax service prepared her taxes with a written guarantee that they would pay if they made a mistake.  When I went over her return they had given the IRS an extra $100 (in case they made a mistake) in such a way that the IRS would not be returning the $100 as an error.  H&R tax program picked it up and we filed again.
 When you fill out your Taxes with the H&R  you have an audit program which can pick up errors and as you go through the questions so you might see ideas on how you can qualify for deduction for this or next years.  It sure has helped me.
 I don't work or am not related to anyone that works  for or own company stock.  I have never gone to a H&R Block preparer.

I used to use TurboTax for the past four or five years.  Last Spring when I was doing my tax with TurboTax halfway through, it could not install the State portion on my home PC.  I tried everything I could based on TurboTax's Help file and its website, including sending a few emails and calling their phantom phone number.  And I was never able to get any reply, let alone talking to someone live for help.  I finally was able to work around by installing another copy of TurboTax on my company laptop, which is something I really did not want to do but had to do just to complete my tax return.  That is when I vowed never to use TurboTax again.

Luckily, when I started looking this year, I found H&R Block at Home offers pretty much the same set of features and functions at roughly half of the reduced price of TurboTax offered at Costco.  I wish I had switched earlier.  In addition, in case I do need to talk to someone for help, I know I can turn to H&R block's local offices.

I tried Turbo Tax (my brother in law had a version) I actually liked H&R better.  It is very simple and it is so nice to just e-file.

With the premimum verison, you get a lot more including state filing and option to ask H&R Block one question for a small fee (I think $15).

64838,5,H&R Block,106.4,"04 24, 2011","I've used TaxCut every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both TaxCut and TurboTax to compare. I repeated this experiment this year. I found that TurboTax did not do anything better than TaxCut while costing consistently more.

TaxCut software also wins if compared to the free on-line options. I don't like using the on-line tax programs for two reasons (1) I don't want my financial data to be on someone's web site (2) free offers include the Federal tax only.

H&R Block tax software does a good job despite having a few flaws, my two pain complaints:

1. My annual pet peeve: foreign tax credit over the limit to be directly on 1040 is not done automatically, it require entering data manually. This form is not that hard to do manually as this form does not change year to year, but not it is not clear to me why the program cannot do the right thing.

2. Copy and Paste from Interview screens is not possible. Sometimes I wish to do it for some issue as a reminder to myself. My solution is to do PrintScreen (holding ctl key, shift key, and printscreen key at the same time). This generates an image of the screen, which I paste into paint or photo editing sofware which I can print or save for later.

In addition to tax software, the package includes DeductionPro software. I find it helpful in organizing and valuating charity donations, such as clothing and household items.

The interview process is helpful in reminding you things you might have forgotten. On-line help is useful. Despite a few annoyances, it does a good job.","After purchasing both TaxCut and TurboTax, prefer TaxCut"

64840,5,H&R Block,106.4,"01 6, 2011","Before I share my Win7-64 experience, I want to suggest that if you are undecided between HR Block At Home 2010 Deluxe vs. Premium, then you can go to [...] and click on each product and find a link for ""View Forms"". When I did this I found that the form list on Deluxe vs. Premium was the same, and the difference in products was that Premium has more help/advice/wizards.

I was pleasantly surprised to be able to buy 2009 HR Block Deluxe download (Fed + State) for $6 at amazon, when other sources for the software were all priced upwards of $30 and more.

My first problem was when downloading 2009 Illinois State on Jan. 5, 2011. The symptom was ""sending info to server"" busy box with no apparent time-out. Had to exit the application. 1st thought was a firewall problem. turning off the firewall made no difference. Next thought was that software was a 32-bit version. Explore to the application, rt.-click select Properties, select Compatibility tab showed that the software had installed to run in Windows Vista 32-bit. So I kept retrying after about 5 times it worked. Perhaps I hit a maintenance window on the Block server. Then I could prepare the State return as I had in the past.

Second problem was that I wanted to create a PDF, and the SavePDF button opened an Explorer window so I could run InstallPDF995. Running it produced an ""installation failed"" message. Changing the compatibility mode to Windows XP made no difference. However, before the ""failed"" message a web-address flashed. It was [...]. From that site I downloaded pdf995.com and installed. (must shut down HR Block At Home to do this). Then restarting Block At Home and clicking SavePDF, Block At Home found the pdf995.exe (which gives you 2 advertising screens which you can ignore or send them $20 to make the pop-up go away) and produced 2 pdf files. A modest 23 pager for the tax returns and a whopping 113 pager ""for my records"".  The latter took about 3 minutes to produce, so be patient if you go this route. I plan on uninstalling pdf995.

Otherwise, the Block At Home performed as advertised was up to date with everything I needed. I had Schedule C, D, and K-1's to deal with; Deluxe handled them all expertly.

Hope this helps.",Experience with HR Block AtHome Deluxe in Win7 64-bit

This year it allows you to load all dividends and interest from retirement accounts directly from your financial company directly into the tax forms; no more typing a lot of data by hand.  For a retired person this is a great advantage.  Their only problem is that they don't seem to so any advertising.  Turbo tax is everywhere you look, but At Home seems to be invisible.

I have not done my taxes yet, so I have not encountered any problems.  If I do I will return and update this review.  I did notice in the reviews that some people had troubles in downloading the state edition (VA in my case).  I had no problem downloading and installing the VA program.  Since last year my computer got a virus which required me to erase everything and reload. All my data was backed up on a external drive.  However, I did want to look at my 2008 return on my computer so I reloaded the 2088 TaxCut and updated it with no problem.  Then I downloaded the VA state version for 2008 which went very smoothly.  So far everything is working fine.  Last year I did have a problem with the updates which required me to get tech support from H&R Block which worked very well.

As an aside, I worked for a year as an H&R Block tax preparer and was shocked to learn their program in the office was nothing like TaxCut.  It was very difficult to learn and to use.  Of course, it was very powerful, but a pain.  Even when I worked in the H&R Block office I continued using TaxCut for ours and our children & mother-in-law returns.",No problems yet

I have been also impressed with Customer Support from this company in that they helped me 'open' last year's retained returns by providing a 'free' online copy of a state program somehow missing from my computer.

The software is straightforward and easy to use. Just read the question and answer it!  That simple.

I would suggest that if you have a font size issue, that is coming from your computer's set resolution. Change your PCs settings and it will fix that issue.

As with any software, ensure it will actually run on your computer. Check the minimum requirements against what you have. If you don't have the minimums....don't waste your money. Also, remember that ""minimums"" are just that. If you only have the minimums for any software requirements you risk your PC running slow...it will run though. Also, you may want to consider not having other programs open while running it--that is a rule-of-thumb, if you find your PC running slow while using any program. If you don't have enough RAM (memory) in your machine, any program will appear sluggish or worse.

My hard drive crashed and upon re-installation this software acted strange.  The personal taxes worked perfectly but the business did not, it would not print anything.

I purchased this title via an Amazon Visa cardholder special offer for March, 2011: 20% off on tax software. This was one of several titles available as part of that offer.

I am a self-employed consulting professional and have a slightly more complicated tax situation than the average employee.  However, I've always used the most basic version of tax software.  This edition is called ""Deluxe"" because it includes both the federal and state programs in one package.

A caveat: I do keep a spreadsheet with income and expenses up to date throughout the year.  I also know what the Schedule C deductions are, so that spreadsheet is already sorted and formatted with the necessary data going in.  I also have been doing my own taxes for several years, and thus know what to expect.

With no importing, however, I was able to complete both returns in under two hours. Including printing and sealing the forms in envelopes (I'm not a big fan of e-file). With the Amazon special offer, the software was delivered for less than $30.  It saved me about eight hours worth of time.  Meaning per hour I paid less than minimum wage for a fully professional tax filing product.

One peet peeve:  The program expects a 1024x768 size display as a minimum.  If you use the software on a netbook with a 1024x600 display, it complains that the display is too small.  Since netbooks outsell laptops 2:1, I would expect that the program would be designed for the smaller screen.  But just ignore the complaint and use the software in full-screen mode on a netbook: works just fine!",Federal and State Taxes Finished In Two Hours

64981,5,H&R Block,106.4,"05 8, 2010","I've used H&R Block for the last 3+ years. I've never been disappointed with it ... so far. Ok, one minor exception, but I'll get to that. I originally tried because it was on a ridiculous deal at OfficeSomthing where you got tax software, MS Money, and a couple of other things for around $30 after rebates. I could not pass up trying it. Since then, I've been getting it online usually and have never regretted using it.

I purchased the electronic download from Amazon. I've purschased one other Amazon download, which was a mp3. This, like the previous purchase, went off without a hitch. The download did require their software to be installed, but I had no problems with its function under Windows 7 Professional 64-bit through a cable connection. I did purchase it late in the game, March, so some of the issues mentioned by other reviewers may have been worked out by then; I rarely by early into anything to avoid such problems. I was concerned about the purchase due to some negative reviews of the downloads and codes. However, install went fine, updates went fine, state download went fine, state e-file purchase and processing went fine, and finally the free federal e-file went fine; I'm always worried about ""codes"" provided for services because they are sometimes stolen (used before use) and sometimes just don't work as some reviewer commented.

There were a couple of software glitches that caused the software to just die. This caused a couple of minor reentries, but for the most part the software was stable. Updates and downloads were fine. I had an issue with entry of stock sale information. The electroinc entry allowed for no wiggle room related to exceptional conditions. The IRS paper instructions state something like ""if there are exceptions, attach a note of explanation"". The electronic form entry does not allow that. In my case, the basis for gifted stock had two possible values as the IRS rules state; the basis at the time stock was purchased and the basis at the time of giftng. This directly affects the tax liability. There was not a good way of expressing that I did not owe tax and still put in one of the valid numbers since the sale price fell between them. So, I had to match (fake) the basis number to match the sale price so that the software computed 0 differnce and neither a tax credit nor tax liability. This came from a suggestion on the online forum, which in my case actually did help me decide what to do. The online forum allows you after registration to post (only requires registartion) and review questions and answers. Also, this entry massaging allowed me to still electronicly file the return without appending a note of explanation. I was concnerned that after buying the software I would have to print and paper submit. Fortunately, that did not have to happen. I'm grateful for the suggestion from the tax people who apparently do visit the site.

The best thing about this kind of software is the carry over from year to year of last year's info, names, ids, tax refunds, .... It makes entry very simple for only the new W2 info, interest, and deductions. It makes completing a tax return very simplistic; assuming that you have all your documents kept somewhere from the previous year (but that's True no matter how you do taxes). Also, most of the federal info is auto-filled in for the state. State literally takes about 5 minutes once the federal is in order. Any last minute federal changes automatically update the state, which again requires no duplicate book entry. I just love that. Simple. Then a few steps to submit the federal and state online and I'm good. No stamps or envelopes to fill out.

So far, I've had great success with this software. This is my second Amazon purchase and first electronic download of the software. I'll keep using it since I like that it makes taxes ALMOST ""fun"". At the lvery least, much less of a chore! Some complain about the charing for state e-file, but If included, you would only end up paying an additional $20 in the price. I'm not sure what the basis for the complaints other than I didn't pay for it once when I bought or I want it all for $10 and no more. Ok, one could hope, but they can charge what they want for it since we do still live in America last I checked; capitalism and all. And everyone has the right to refuse to buy it at that price. The only thing that I do agree with is the sometimes misleading ""features"" that should spell out CLEARLY that e-file for fedral is included but state is NOT. They do say the, but it's sometimes too well hidden. Other than that, I recommend using the software and sticking with the brand for simplicity of next years. What I do not recommend is getting the software too early in the year AND not buying it automatically from H&R Block when it is released for full price. Come to Amazon from February-April and look for a good deal. So far, they have not priced it out of my usefulness even with the $20 for state e-filing fee. I think that a total $50 is worth the time saved in entering all the redundant year to year stuff and corrections that are so much easier to make electronically in software rather than on paper.",No problems found here.

Great way to do it for me, and the price was really cheap.  Bad thing was, my State (the wonderful state of Georgia), still wanted to charge me an additional $15 to e-file, so I spent the cost of a stamp instead.  That's not H & R Block's proble.

Finally, some people complained that they didn't get their product code.  I don't know if this was a bug that was fixed or what, but the downloader software clearly displayed my product code (used for e-filing your return), furthermore, you can get the code at any time via Amazon.com, just click on the ""Go to your software library"" button.

Like other user's review that H&R Tax packages do not have bookkeeping software like Turbotax Quickbook which can export all needed info to it's own tax package to be used during tax processing. I do use Quickbook and it can be associated into H&R and it took me 1 year to figure it out (I run two packages, Turbotax for business and H&R Premium & Business, paralleling in the first year). This H&R Premium & Business is an all-in-one super TAX RETURN package and price is very very reasonable.

In 2009 our business did well but not well enough to afford a $2000 accountant so i used turbo tax. HUGE MISTAKE. Spent over 50 hours completing and reviewing JUST THE BUSINESS and then had to purchase a separate program to do the trust and LP and personal. Over $200 and sent it in by mail because of problems. Plus not seamless integration. I actually brought in a 8' board to make a flow chart. HOWEVER, FOR TAX YEAR 2010 WE DOWNLOADED AND USED H&R BLOCK. I completed a seamless flow of info from parent company thru lp to trust passing into personal and filed all 5 fed and 4 state returns all for the price of this program! WOW - This was the easiest tax return i have ever participated in. I spent as much time getting my tax accountant, requested information, as i did doing my taxes with H&R block software. In fact, i will continue to do our taxes even when we get back to 8 figures. Don't consider these reviews about idiots bashing the program because they couldn't figure out the install. I switched computers just after installing the software and then moved from a desktop to a laptop, i actually installed this program on 4 computers.

To those of you with similar concerns I had no problem whatsoever. Both the personal and business programs installed and updated as they should, I didn't have to do any work arounds. I purchased the actual CD from Amazon on 2/7/11.

I have used tax cut for many years, and like others had used turbo tax in the past. I had issues with how both programs interviews worked and can't say I'm convinced one is better than the other. But less face it the tax code is not easy, neither of these programs is fool proof.

Having said that, for my needs which include filing 1040's, 1120's (corp) and 1065's (partnerships)and corresponding state returns I save a lot of $$ with H&R Block. My total cost with H&R is about sixty bucks, with turbo tax it would be over two hundred and fifty. With turbo tax not only do you have to buy separate business and personal software (assuming you use both) but on the business software you have to buy the state software for each type of entity you file for at $50 a pop.

Bottom line. I think both H&R and Turbo tax have pluses and minuses. Operationally I don't see much difference. However H&R is a better value as all the various business entites and there relavent state returns are included within this single purchase.",No Problems with Windows 7

There was an inadequate number of lines for the number of orgainizations that I gave to so I erased the input and listed those below $100.00 on numeric categories.  When I had completed the section I looked at my return and it was a fabulous amount.  It had added the new input to the original.

65052,5,H&R Block,47.3333333333333,"02 25, 2011","I have been using Tax Cut (which is now H&R Block) since 97.  I have done my own taxes every year since 1974, except for a couple of years I had an accountant do them, which was because I had a small business for a while with employees.  I have had years which I had my schedules to submit, and this has worked well. This is not a business tax s/w version.  I give this s/w 5 stars as it is really easy to use.  Yes, I can do my taxes by hand like I used to do years ago, but why?  The s/w is so easy to use, checks for errors, is faster, and allows me to have my refunds in my account in less that 2 weeks.

Import - You can import the previous year's HR block taxes to set up many defaults, such as names, addresses, dependents, employers, 1099s, ....  You can even import from some other financial software too.  If your employer has done so (like mine) you can even import your W2.

Fill in - The simple method to then enter your data is in an interview method, where you select some details about your tax situation, and it then prompts you information.  It will present you with worksheets to help calculate and track multiple entries that fill in a single line, like interest declaration.  These are nice because you can print off your complete taxes later with these tables to let you have a nice full picture of what you used and reported.  You can always go in and edit the actual tax form directly if you want, but I find the interview method is so easy and fast, there is no reason to do so.

Error check - Once you complete the entry, the software will examine the forms looking for anything that looks incorrect or may flag something to the IRS.  You can easily jump to the section in question to correct if needed, or accept that its correct.

State - The deluxe version comes with 1 free state tax version.  This is downloaded and not included in the box.  To fill in my state forms took about a couple of minutes, as it imports the data from the federal forms, and only asked me a few questions.

Filing - This version comes with 5 free federal e-files.  This should be enough for most families to file their own and kids, and possibly parents.  You can efile your state forms as well, but this costs about $20 which you can pay with CC or deduct from your federal refund (if you have one).  You can print off actual forms to mail in if you wish, including a sheet to tell you what to mail and the address to mail the forms.  I e-filed both my state and federal forms on 2/14 and had my money direct deposited into my account by 2/25.  Mailing a check to you is an option, but does take longer.  This is about the typical time for a refund.","Great tool, easy to use."

65063,5,H&R Block,47.3333333333333,"01 16, 2013","I've been doing my own taxes since I was 18 years old. I have a family of 4, with income from a job AND income from self-employment, own my own home, 401k, etc. I normally get the 'Deluxe' version which includes everything I need to cover all of our income and deductions. I also get the +State version which is very handy. Last year, I got the Deluxe version without State and regretted it later. Even though the state forms are super-easy, I had to take the time to read everything myself and print forms from the state website when the software could have done it all for me. It really does save time to let the software do BOTH returns! The software walks you through each step of your return, asking questions along the way, to help you get every deduction available. Rarely have I ever had to go to the IRS website for clarification, since the software is extremely thorough.

I've used both Turbotax and the H&R Block At Home software over the years. Turbotax is ALWAYS more expensive and I have yet to figure out why. It does the EXACT same thing that H&R Block software does. They both walk you through every bit of your return, asking lots of questions to determine how and what you should file. So for 2 years I used Turbotax and then switched to Taxcut (now called H&R Block At Home), and I found nothing new.. nothing that the H&R Block didn't have... that would make me want to pay nearly 50% more for the Turbotax software. I am now in my 5th or 6th year of using the Taxcut/H&R Block At Home software and it STILL continues to be cheaper than Turbotax, and just as good for doing your own taxes.

One important note: The biggest favor you can do for yourself is always CHECK YOUR RETURN ON YOUR OWN. Once the software has finished, print the forms and other information and go over it yourself. Check each line carefully and get out your calculator and do all the math too! One tiny little glitch could delay your refund. Just because the software is doing a lot of work for you doesn't negate your diligence in proofreading it too :)",Super-Easy to Use and Inexpensive!

If there's anything to complain about, I'd say it was difficult to find the simplest version capable of handling securities exchanges, dividends, itemized deductions etc.  I didn't need/want extended advice, just the ability to fill out the forms and check for errors.

Couldn't find the appropriate product in retail stores, then finally decided to look on Amazon.  Duh.  There it was with a very attractive price -- and it was all I needed.  Others may do better with the Premium version, but this was all I needed and it filled that need in the most painless way possible to properly file my tax return and send it electronically.

I was doing my taxes in no time at all. I was worried that I might miss something this year because I had to install a new heat pump.

I downloaded the software from Amazon to save a few dollars and began my filing immediately.  It read in my previous information and I am pretty sure it can import from the others as well.  It probably took me less than an hour to do my entire return.  Of course I am very familiar with the process having used Block for so long, but I do use quite a bit of the features of the software to handle charitable donations, capital gains on stock sales, dividend income, home office deduction, vehicle for business deduction and mortgage, interest, property and real estate tax credits.

I have state income tax but that was no problem, the state program took less than 10 minutes to complete.  State filing is still a bit high at 19.99 - seems this should be more of a standard.  But you can't touch this with the other programs I researched and a tax service charges considerably more.

For folks who are reasonably computer savvy, this program rocks.","Still a great, functional, user-friendly tax program!"

So I ordered, received, and used the H&R Block at Home 2010 package.  As always, the Amazon ordering and delivery process went smoothly.  The H&R Block package was everything I wanted in convenience, and it showed me tips and savings that surprised and delighted me.

Although it doesn't leave you without any responsibility for determining how to handle certain income, deductions, credits,expenses, etc., it has really come of age since I first started using it. It handles fairly sophisticated personal tax return needs. I knew my return was going to be more complicated this year than it had been previously, and I had some doubts about whether H&R Block At Home would be able to handle it. No problem, though.

As for ease of use, this is probably where I've seen the most improvement over past versions. I still find navigation between different sections of a return-in-progress a little counter-intuitive, but otherwise the program is extremely user-friendly.

I've never used TurboTax, the leader in do-it-yourself tax software, so I can't compare H&R Block At Home to it. However, if I'd ever toyed with the idea of trying the competition before, the features of H&R Block At Home are such in this 2010 version that I'm perfectly satisfied sticking with it.",This fully-matured tax software is a great value!

I can say that the 2010 HR Block is the same easy to use software as the past few years. Some may gripe that the deduction software must be accessed online vs being installed on your computer, but the functionality is still the same and you can save the deduction file to your PC. I also want people to know that I tried the online HR Block and could not get it to import my info from last year. The downloaded software imported everything fine and I had no issues. After doing my taxes with 2010 HR Block, I used Turbo Tax Deluxe to compare my numbers and try their software.

It is very easy to use, and goes step by step through the return.  I also like the fact that it shows at a glance in the upper right hand corner whether you're getting a refund or how much you owe - for federal AND state returns (after you download your state).

One tip previously mentioned is to use an ""online price alert"" to get the lowest price on the software.  I actually purchased it cheaper this year than last by using the alert.

Also, be sure to download updates for the program once you get it installed.  I see from some of the reviews that this has been an issue for some people, but it is very easy to check for updates and download them.  Usually major updates are released before the end of January, and yes, sometimes there are multiple updates needed.  This is True with ANY software you use.

We used TurboTax ONCE and will never use it again.  The H&R Block software is far superior, IMHO.

If you have trouble understanding a tax return in general, or have an extremely complicated return, then seeing a tax professional is probably the best idea for you.

I found one, Liberty Tax Services, from Yelp, it got great reviews from a lot of people and I thought I should give it a try. So I made an appointment with the one people are raving about on Yelp. I brought my itemized list that I've been using based on H&R software questionare to my appoinment. The person I met was about mid 20s, nice guy, he looked at my previous year tax return and current income status and told me it'll cost about $300! I thought if I'm going to pay this guy that much compare to H&R block premium software for not more than $80, I should get more refund on my returns, right? WRONG!!! He told me I owe IRS three figures more on top of our withholding, which was like five figures already. He asked me few items that I've already had noted on my itemized list, thanks to H&R questionare, to make me feel like I'm getting my money worth.

I told him not to file my return and went home and downloaded my good old H&R Premium from amazon for $45. Plug in my numbers, within 2 days of double and triple checking my returns, and wala.... I get three figures refund from IRS and $2000 more from the state compare to professional tax service provider. I found one software bug in dependent care deduction though, but it was irrelevant for me since we don't qualify for child care expenses because of our income.

Cons: No free state e-file (come on, it's about time). 5 free federal for 1 couple filing joint? Not much sense there, but that's the same of all programs. Had a hangup on installing state.

I have used and continue to use TurboTax for my personal returns, but after reading bad reviews on the TurboTax Business and given the fact that TurboTax requires you to purchase a separate state version, I decided to try H&R Block.

The product does a great job and is nicely priced for a package that gives you both federal and state business returns. If you are a TurboTax user there is a bit of adjustment using the menus and process followed by H&R Block but it is quickly learned.

I also had to contact customer service to clarify an issue and the response was quick, efficient, knowledgeable and pleasant. They even use a ""GoTo Assist"" (or similar product) to help you through the service call.

I would recommend this product to anyone and its customer service as well, and would consider both the product and support to be superior to my experience with TurboTax. It is also great to get both federal and state business returns in the same package.

65228,5,H&R Block,55.5,"03 21, 2011","I must admit - I was worried about giving this program a try based on the reviews.  But at $55, I figured I did not have much to lose if it didn't work out, and it turned out to be a great investment.  After spending anywhere from 1k-$3k annually with various accountants filing my s-corp and personal returns over the past few years, I was pretty successful in getting nearly everything together for both filings in short order (one evening), hence saving me considerable money.  It helped to have my previous returns that were prepared by a professional as a guide to make sure the program was doing things correctly.

The only area for which I needed some additional help beyond the software was for depreciation of fixed assets as it related to closing down my business.  For these questions, I was able to make some phone calls to some CPA friends to get my questions answered.

I probably wold not recommend this approach for those that have trouble understanding tax forms or for first year business filings. However, once you have your first return prepared by a professional, the software makes it quite easy to duplicate everything the professional completed for previous returns and provides the confidence that you are doing everything correctly.  I wish I had taken this approach in prior years.","Did the Job, Fairly Easy & Painless"

65232,5,H&R Block,55.5,"02 19, 2011","First, some background on my experience on tax software:

I have been using tax software for over a dozen years now. I started with TurboTax and switched to TaxCut in 2005. Since then I have stayed with HR Block, with the exception of 2008, when a friend working at Intuiti got me TurboTax for cheap.

This year, as usual, I started researching tax software in December. When I finally focused in on HR Block -- again for its lower price -- I became skeptical of it because of the bad reviews here at Amazon. After reading the reviews carefully, I decided that most bad reviews could be attributed to the users not the product.

In short, I am happy with my purchase. Installation and importing of last year's return was both a breeze simply by following the instructions. I installed the software on a new computer. All I had to do was copying last year's data file over from my old desktop, and the software picked it up without a glitch.

65241,5,H&R Block,55.5,"05 27, 2012","I have been doing my own taxes since I watched an H&R Block accountant physically do them in 10 minutes way back in 1965, the first year I was on my own and not part of my parents' returns.

Very intrigued by the ""challenge,"" I purchased an H&R Block do-it-yourself book t

hat year and have been doing my own taxes every year since. My tax returns were very simple back then but they got more and more complicated with each passing year to the point where it took days to complete, especially after it took weeks of free time compiling the data necessary to support each deduction in preparation for my first of three subsequent tax audits.

After those three audits, spread out over a five-year period, one of which cost me money due to my selection of the wrong depreciation schedule out of a gazillion options, and two of which actually led to missed deductions that resulted in additional refunds for a significant net gain, doing my own taxes became a relentless chore that I no longer enjoyed.

Then 12 years ago my youngest son brought home a copy of H&R Block Home and Business software and doing my own taxes has become a breeze ever since. Oh, I still have to compile the data, which other software helps me do, but the H&R Block Home and Business Federal and State software incorporates all the latest changes in the tax codes, asks all the right questions, puts all the numbers in all the right places, selects all the right forms, transfer all the right data for the state return, electronically files the returns with the IRS and state taxing bodies, and populates the next year's tax returns with the necessary data to begin the process all over again.

The fact that I have not had a tax audit since I began using H&R Block Home and Business software (most recently H&R Block At Home 2010 Premium & Business Federal + State + eFile) doesn't mean I won't undergo one in the future, during which I'll have to justify this deduction or that interpretation of the tax code. But I do know that I won't have to justify the forms I used, the application of the extremely complicated tax laws, or the math calculations, all of which would have taken days to figure out instead of the minutes it takes H&R Block Home and Business software to accomplish.

Personally speaking, after using H&R Block Home and Business software for that past dozen years, I can't imagine doing it any other way and I strongly recommend it to anyone who is doing their taxes on their own. And if you're starting out like I did lo those many years ago, begin with the appropriate H&R Block tax software package. Believe me, you'll discover tax forms, deductions, and credits you never thought of, and you'll be embarking on a lifelong program that'll ensure your tax returns are done right in a fraction of the time it'll take yu to do on your own or the fees it'll cost to have someone else do them for you.

And, finally, buying and dowloading the software on Amazon.com ensures you get the best price and service available.","H&R Block Tax Software Saves Time and Money, and Avoids Mistakes"

I plan to purchase HR Block software again next year.

If you have used previous versions of this product you will find that little has changed in the way that it operates.

I'm a bit disappointed that I can't file until after Jan 31 since the final forms aren't ready yet.  I understand that this is because it took so long to finalize the final tax code for 2010.  H&R Block also warns that there will be delays by the government in processing refunds this year if you itemized :(

I have used the e-file for over 5 years now and I am definitely never going to snail mail again.  Keep in mind that the ""free"" e-file is for federal only.  You will still need to pay to e-file your state return.  I normally wouldn't recommend paying $15 for something that could be handled by a couple of stamps.  I feel that the fee is worth it since the return gets processed faster and no public employee needs to manually enter or scan in the forms that you would have mailed.

I hope that H&R Block continues to offer this product for the Mac.

Some people may find the following as negatives...

65254,5,H&R Block,55.9,"12 28, 2011","I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both TaxCut and TurboTax to compare. I found that TurboTax did not do anything better than TaxCut while costing consistently more. In addition, I like the option of being able to file 5 free Federal e-files as I do taxes for other relatives who are less computer savvy.

H&R Block software also wins if compared to the free on-line options. I don't like using the on-line tax programs for two reasons (1) I don't want my financial data to be on someone's web site (2) free offers include the Federal tax only.

This year I used a digital download for the first time rather than a boxed version. I liked the security of having a physical CD in case I need to re-install on another computer several years down the road. But you are supposed to be able to download the software again to a different computer and when the boxed version was not available I went digital.

REGISTRATION ISSUE

Downloading the software was easy, however during the install I got an error registering the software. When I started the software it immediately gave me a prompt to enter a key-code which (the prompt said) I should have received in the email after purchasing the software. The email I received from Amazon contained no such key-code. I had to call Amazon support and they told me that this information can be found following these steps
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

Once this was done the rest of the software functions well. In fact it looked more polished than in prior years. I always had minor display problems because I use large fonts and they never scaled quite right. This year everything displayed perfectly.

DISPLAY ISSUE

I read one review which mentioned a problem with seeing selection boxes.  The problem there most likely caused by low screen resolution.  Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher.  At a lower resolution, there will be problem with display such as not seeing selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

TAX PREPARATION

I did a preliminary tax return and below are my observations.

1. Copy and Paste from Interview screens is not possible. Sometimes I wish to do it for some issue as a reminder to myself. My solution is to do PrintScreen (holding ctl key, shift key, and PrintScreen key at the same time). This generates an image of the screen, which I paste into paint or photo editing software which I can print or save for later.

2. I don't use the default location for the tax returns, as I want to my backup program to back up only the data not the software itself. The software does not initially remember this new location on startup, it tells me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it does remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

3. Some forms (such as foreign tax credit over the limit to be directly on 1040) in the past required to be filled out without much assistance. This year the foreign tax credit form is more automated, when you hit next button it takes you to the next place on the form you need to fill out with explanations for each field (last your you were just presented the form to fill out on your own). This form is not that hard to do manually as this form does not change year to year.

4. I use large font option on my monitor display and in the past had display issues (some things were displayed on top of each other). This year all forms displayed properly with this option. This is the first time in all the years I've used H&R Block software that I have no complaint about the display and did not need to change my monitor settings just to do the tax preparation. Nice!

5. In prior years the package include DeductionPro software. This year, like last year, this software is only available as an online tool. I will not use software that requires me to put my financial data on their site, and DeductionPro wants to import the data to H&R web site, so I will not be using it. Disappointing.

6. The price on this package changes day to day. I found a nice tools that shows history of Amazon prices and allows you to generate an email alert when the price reaches our desired price range. If you enter ""price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, it has the word camel in the name. I find this tool very helpful.

Updated: 7. **Error alert** if you are using 64-bit Windows please see review by SD_James, who describes how to solve the installation issue for Windows 7 64-bit operating system.

I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. The interview process is helpful in reminding you things you might have forgotten. On-line help is useful. 2011 H&R Block package appears more polished and has a number of improvements to a couple of small pet peeves I had in the past. So I am quite pleased with it and recommend it!

Possibly the process has been so smooth because I always buy the version with the CD.

TurboTax has been getting the proverbial ""run for their money"" this year with the competing H&R Block products so it's understandable that they are trying to preserve market share against a competitor they view as moving in on their ""turf"" so to speak. I feel honestly quite certain that some of the reviews are reflective of that issue. That is, be wary of negative reviews of this product as they may be unfairly biased in favor of TurboTax.

1. I had NO (ZERO) installation problems on my machine.

65280,5,H&R Block,35.9,"04 9, 2012","This is the first time I bought this product from Amazon, and as always they did not disappoint in delivering it very expeditously.  It is a tax program so how excited can one get over that.  I have used both Turbo Tax and Tax Cut and you choose which one you prefer.  My taxes are simple and not involved.  My sister who was handling an estate and using the basic copy found that there was a form she needed that was not included in the basic version.  So I would suggest you make sure it has the forms you need if you know them before deciding what version you purchase.

Other than that..... It is still a TAX PROGRAM....  LOL",A Tax Program
65281,5,H&R Block,35.9,"12 16, 2011","I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both TaxCut and TurboTax to compare. I found that TurboTax did not do anything better than TaxCut while costing consistently more. In addition, I like the option of being able to file 5 free Federal e-files as I do taxes for other relatives who are less computer savvy.

H&R Block software also wins if compared to the free on-line options. I don't like using the on-line tax programs for two reasons (1) I don't want my financial data to be on someone's web site (2) free offers include the Federal tax only.

This year I used a digital download for the first time rather than a boxed version. I liked the security of having a physical CD in case I need to re-install on another computer several years down the road. But you are supposed to be able to download the software again to a different computer and when the boxed version was not available I went digital.

REGISTRATION ISSUE

Downloading the software was easy, however during the install I got an error registering the software. When I started the software it immediately gave me a prompt to enter a key-code which (the prompt said) I should have received in the email after purchasing the software. The email I received from Amazon contained no such key-code. I had to call Amazon support and they told me that this information can be found following these steps
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

Once this was done the rest of the software functions well. In fact it looked more polished than in prior years. I always had minor display problems because I use large fonts and they never scaled quite right. This year everything displayed perfectly.

DISPLAY ISSUE

I read one review which mentioned a problem with seeing selection boxes. The problem there most likely caused by low screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution, there will be problem with display such as not seeing selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

TAX PREPARATION

I did a preliminary tax return and below are my observations.

1. H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade to a more expensive version of software even when it is not necessary.

2. Copy and Paste from Interview screens is not possible. Sometimes I wish to do it for some issue as a reminder to myself. My solution is to do PrintScreen (holding ctl key, shift key, and PrintScreen key at the same time). This generates an image of the screen, which I paste into paint or photo editing software which I can print or save for later.

3. I don't use the default location for the tax returns, as I want to my backup program to back up only the data not the software itself. The software does not initially remember this new location on startup, it tells me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it does remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

4. Some forms (such as foreign tax credit over the limit to be directly on 1040) in the past required to be filled out without much assistance. This year the foreign tax credit form is more automated, when you hit next button it takes you to the next place on the form you need to fill out with explanations for each field (last your you were just presented the form to fill out on your own). This form is not that hard to do manually as this form does not change year to year.

5. I use large font option on my monitor display and in the past had display issues (some things were displayed on top of each other). This year all forms displayed properly with this option. This is the first time in all the years I've used H&R Block software that I have no complaint about the display and did not need to change my monitor settings just to do the tax preparation. Nice!

6. In prior years the package include DeductionPro software. This year, like last year, this software is only available as an online tool. I will not use software that requires me to put my financial data on their site, and DeductionPro wants to import the data to H&R web site, so I will not be using it. Disappointing.

7. The price on this package changes day to day. I found a nice tools that shows history of Amazon prices and allows you to generate an email alert when the price reaches our desired price range. If you enter ""price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, it has the word camel in the name. I find this tool very helpful.

8.  For folks trying to download State Forms before January 16, 2012. The state forms are not available for download until January 16 for most states.
If you go to the Software Update Center on H&R website you will see a section called State Updates. Under there you there is a link called ""Forms Available"". If you click on that, it will show a table that shows availability of forms for each State.  Right now (last checked on 1/6/2011) none of them are available.  I called about my state (Massachusetts) and they told me that most state forms will become available for download on January 16. In the software package, select State Tab and click the button that is called ""Buy""  (a little scary since we already paid for it) but then ""buy""  will turn into ""update"" and when the forms will become available they will be downloaded to your computer.

9. ** ERROR ALERT ** 1/16/12 Version of Massachusetts state return contained an error that was corrected in 1/24/12 update.
If you owed taxes on your 2010 State return and paid owed tax in 2011, this payment was incorrectly included in Line 36 on the MA Form 1 as an amount withheld in 2011. This overstates the amount paid to the State for the 2011 tax year. This error has been reported to H&R and corrected in 1/24/12 update.

I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. The interview process is helpful in reminding you things you might have forgotten. On-line help is useful. 2011 H&R Block package appears more polished and has a number of improvements to a couple of small pet peeves I had in the past. So I am quite pleased with it and recommend it!

The price I paid on Amazon was about half of what it is today (Feb 9, 2012) simply because I grabbed it on one day when the price dipped.  Of the two major tax preparation products, this one is by far the best for several reasons:  it leads you through your return by simply asking questions; it's got many ways you can stop and seek ""help,"" all of which were quite supportive in my view; the price is usually about $10-$15 less than the other product; it quickly imports data (your name, SSAN, mutual funds, expected employers' data, etc, so you don't have to type this repetitive information into your 1040 every year.

I have used this program year after year, so I don't expect to find too many faults, but as I said, I will do an update.  What I should have done is wait for a better price.  I bought it at 34 dollars and change.  You can get it now for 19 dollars and change.  Tax law has changed allowing banks, businesses, etc. to wait until much later to provide your tax information therefore there really is no need to buy early.

Update:  This year's version provides for downloading tax info from many financial firms.  Most firms have established deadlines when this feature will be available.  My firm will be ready to download on February 2nd.  Of course, you always have the option to enter the info from a paper form, or using online data at the firms web site.
The tax software itself has had one update in late January and another update is scheduled for February 23rd.  Without the updating being completed (there may be more), you cannot submit your return with any confidence it is correct.  The software will tell you if another update is planned.

Update:  I downloaded data from my financial firm.  Numerous entries were created for Interest, Dividends, and Stock Sales.  It marks each entry asking you to verify each one.  All entries were accurate.  The download saved me a lot of time.

Update:  I submitted 6 returns (3 Federal and 3 State) for members of my family.  All electronically submitted returns were accepted by the IRS within 1 day.  All returns sailed through processing and refunds came very quickly as direct deposits.  The State returns cost $19.95 to submit electronically.

I am very happy with the program.  I use it on a MAC--it was very easy to install.  (i am still running snow leopard and not sure if that makes a difference).

It comes with free audit support if you ever get audited.  i've been audited two times---both times I won!!!  It also includes a free phone call to a tax advisor but i didn't need to use that as the program is self explanatory.

You get 5 free federal efiles but have to pay for the state efile.

After you are done, i encourage you to save a backup copy as a PDF.  I learned the hard way that the on of the old pc versions i have can no longer be opened on the operating system i have on my pc so i can't really access those taxes.  But, if you save them as a pdf, you don't need the H&R block program to open the document--any computer will always be able to open it.  Lesson learned---luckily, those tax years were so long ago, that it didin't ultimately matter.  I don't print my taxes as they are over 100 pages due to the rental properties, deductions, capital gains, dividends, and small business.

This program is based on Income, Expense, and Personal Information worksheets, which, to me, is much better than going to the IRS forms directly.  When you fill out worksheets, information that needs to go to several forms is distributed to those forms, so you do not have to constantly flip IRS forms.  Because Tax Programs are required to use information correctly, this program works as well as a program I paid more than $1000 for when I was providing tax preparer services to more than 200 persons, after passing the Enrolled Agent Exam (so I do know taxes, but would not like to prepare them without a computer today.)

65425,5,H&R Block,35.9,"11 26, 2011","I'm normally very wary of buying software without a CD to allow reinstallation, a holdover from the copy-protection wars when vendors tried not to let us install anything more than one time on one PC, even if the hard drive later failed.

The H&R Block At Home 2011 software download was a delight, compared to former days and other programs. Like other digital products purchased through Amazon, Amazon remembers what I've purchased, and makes it easy to get it again if necessary. The entire installation process, including starting the program, checking for upgrades (none yet) and entering my key code took only a few minutes via cable broadband. It also quickly and easily read in my data from last year, and offered helpful YouTube videos on changes this year. I now have to wait until the next update expected on January 12 before entering dependents and income.

I've used H&R's tax programs for several years, and been very happy except for having to file a correction last year due to the program initially missing the fact that I'd paid property taxes on my home. (I reported that bug, so don't expect it to be a problem again, but will be sure to check again once I have all my tax forms to enter.) As I pretty much know what I'm doing tax-wise, and my state already offers a simple Web-based way to file my state income tax, this basic verson is all I need. If you want more handholding or a state program too, there are other more advanced versions available, and you'll be offered those if the program thinks you might need them.

I'll update this around the end of January, once I have all the needed 1099s etc. and have filed. But for now, this is a very pleasant, inexpensive and ecological way to quickly and accurately take care of a nasty unavoidable annual chore.

Recommended.

Update: OK, I filed electronically tonight. I had previously gotten right up to the point of filing, but held off for the update that came out in late February, just in case it fixed anything important. I also reconfirmed a few entries and corrected one I'd guessed wrong about before, now that I had the official document in hand. Perhaps as a result of the changes, the program no longer remembered my last year's AGI value or our PINS, so I had to override those as I submitted this evening. Fortunately, I always write those down as I print out the final form, so had them handy. Since I amended last year's return later, I was glad to see this year's program told me to still use the AGI value from my initial return, rather than the amended one.

seems like someone in corporate hit the programmers with a clue stick - this is an improved product over the kludgy version from last year

i almost abandoned this package until i saw it is the same price as in the store, so a download saved me money and helped screw my state govt out of sales tax - which was a sweet deal

65432,5,H&R Block,47.8666666666667,"01 7, 2012","I've been using H&R Block Home/Taxcut since 1999.  I love the software because they are always keeping up to date with all the tax laws and changes all the way up until when you need to file.  I've used it for just basic taxes where it was quick and painless because I just had W-2s to file, as well as when I owned 2 different businesses and filed as an employee, which was a lot of keeping track of oodles and oodles of receipts, expenses and all different types of info.

The software helped immensely when I lived in California.  I rarely had a large refund, but Taxcut's ability to help find different areas where I can claim helped me to stay in the black, which is hard to do in California.  Now I live in Washington and I don't have to worry about filing state... :D

I am a huge proponent of H&R Block Home!",More than worth the cost of the software!
65433,5,H&R Block,47.8666666666667,"01 7, 2012","I bought the download version thinking it was like all the Deluxe versions I'd seen in the stores and included Federal, State, and efile, especially since it was the only Deluxe version I found on Amazon.  The price had gone up $2 since I first looked at it a couple of hours earlier, and it stayed at $27 for the next couple of days, so I went ahead and bought it.  It was only a day or two later that Amazon dropped the price to $17, and while it was frustrating, at least I had my tax software for the year...only I didn't!!  I looked at the deal of the day today and saw that they had SEVERAL versions of the Deluxe software--some for Mac, some for PC, and some with and WITHOUT the State package!!  Sure enough, I had gotten the one without the State package--so I had to end up buying it AGAIN, this time with the State software as well (it was cheaper than paying H&R Block $37 for the State program).  At least it was ""only"" another $20.  So I paid $47 to Amazon for software I could have gotten in the store for $36.  I am VERY unhappy with the way Amazon incorrectly advertised this and randomly changed prices without giving me any recourse!  Be aware...make SURE you get the right package, and read the fine print in the description to be sure you get what you think you are getting!!!  (Actually even the fine print doesn't help, because the comparison chart in the description PLAINLY says that the Deluxe version includes one state's package as well--even though this version of the Deluxe software does NOT.)

As far as the software itself goes, I just installed it and need to wait til I get all my tax documents before I can complete the return, so I don't have much experience with it currently--but it installed easily, and if it's anything like last year's package, it should be easy to use and get the job done.

Ratings wise, I give the software a tentative 5 stars...and I give Amazon 0 stars!!!",Make sure you get what you need!
65434,5,H&R Block,47.8666666666667,"12 29, 2011",Product received as advertised. Easy to install. Ready to receive updates. Works perfect. Great value! Will try a get this next year. Great savings over in store purchase price.,Perfect Transaction
65435,5,H&R Block,47.8666666666667,"12 9, 2011","I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both TaxCut and TurboTax to compare. I found that TurboTax did not do anything better than TaxCut while costing consistently more. In addition, I like the option of being able to file 5 free Federal e-files as I do taxes for other relatives who are less computer savvy.

H&R Block software also wins if compared to the free on-line options. I don't like using the on-line tax programs for two reasons (1) I don't want my financial data to be on someone's web site (2) free offers include the Federal tax only.

This year I used a digital download for the first time rather than a boxed version. I liked the security of having a physical CD in case I need to re-install on another computer several years down the road. But you are supposed to be able to download the software again to a different computer and when the boxed version was not available I went digital.

Downloading the software was easy, however during the install I got an error registering the software. When I started the software it immediately gave me a prompt to enter a key-code which (the prompt said) I should have received in the email after purchasing the software. The email I received from Amazon contained no such key-code. I had to call Amazon support and they told me that this information can be found following these steps
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

Once this was done the rest of the software functions well. In fact it looked more polished than in prior years. I always had minor display problems because I use large fonts and they never scaled quite right. This year everything displayed perfectly.

I read one review which mentioned a problem with seeing selection boxes.  The problem there most likely caused by low screen resolution.  Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher.  At a lower resolution, there will be problem with display such as not seeing selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

I did a preliminary tax return and below are my observations.

1. H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary.

2. Copy and Paste from Interview screens is not possible. Sometimes I wish to do it for some issue as a reminder to myself. My solution is to do PrintScreen (using PrintScreen key). This generates an image of the screen, which I paste into paint or photo editing software which I can print or save for later.

3. I don't use the default location for the tax returns, as I want to my backup program to back up only the data not the software itself. The software does not initially remember this new location on startup, it tells me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it does remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

4. Some forms (such as foreign tax credit over the limit to be directly on 1040) require entering data manually. This year the foreign tax credit form is some what automated, when you hit next button it takes you to the next place on the form you need to fill out (last your you were just presented the form to fill out on your own). This form is not that hard to do manually as this form does not change year to year.

5. I use large font option on my monitor display and in the past had display issues (some things were displayed on top of each other). This year all forms displayed properly with this option. This is the first time in all the years I've used H&R Block software that I have no complaint about the display and did not need to change my monitor settings just to do the tax preparation. Nice!

6. This package include  5 free Federal e-files.  However, if you also need to file a state return and use H&R Block state software (purchased separately) in addition to this package, H&R Block charges $19.95 to e-file each state return. Of course, this charge can be avoided by printing the forms and mailing them in.

7. In prior years the package include DeductionPro software. This year, like last year, this software is only available as an online tool. I will not use software that requires me to put my financial data on their site, and DeductionPro wants to import the data to H&R web site, so I will not be using it. Disappointing.

8. The price on this package changes day to day. I found a nice tools that shows history of Amazon prices and allows you to generate an email alert when the price reaches our desired price range. If you enter ""price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, it has the word camel in the name. I find this tool very helpful.

I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. The interview process is helpful in reminding you things you might have forgotten. On-line help is useful. 2011 H&R Block package appears more polished and has a number of improvements to a couple of small pet peeves I had in the past. So I am quite pleased with it and recommend it!

* Easy and fast download (and this was on the day tax returns were due!)
* Able to import data from TurboTax 2010 return

For those with investments, TurboTax pushes their Premium version which is really pricey compared to H&R Block's Deluxe version which has all that I need. Not only is it less expensive, but I think it is also easier to use.  Both programs seem to want to talk you into an upgrade, a bit annoying but easy to skip over.  From reading it appears that TurboTax may be better at importing investment info,  back in 06 this was True in that TurboTax accepted more import formats.

Went to a CPA and she messed up efiling our tax return - was a big mess because they did not get it in time and we owed fines (which she paid.) So switched to this a couple of years ago and so far am happy with the product. Our taxes are pretty straight forward so this software worked great. It is fairly easy to use and has got me solid refunds. Most importantly it has worked with no problems using efile, so the IRS is not on my back due to late filing.

{PROS}
. Easy, fast download and install - no problems, took less than 15 minutes total
. Easy to use software - walks you through all the steps, asking questions along the way
. Imports you forms from last year
. Up to date tax laws - has all the current revisions so that I don't have to search myself to understand the yearly changes
. Does an error check - found 16 errors where I forgot to fill in some info
. Rates it for audit check - found I was low on the possibility of getting an audit. Means nothing I know if the IRS pulls out your name, but will alert you to possible red flags.
. Allows you to choose which forms you want to print out
. Gives you a status update to let you know if the IRS accepted your efile - gives you a Declaration Control Number as proof that they accepted your return
. You get 5 free efiles, nice if you want to share with your family
. There is a ""go to"" button which allows you to go to any part of the tax returns, forms or steps
. Can import medical, charity, etc from Deduction Pro (online) It lists lots of donated items and the estimated value for each one. You just click on the items, adding them to your deductions. I use this for charity items donated and it works great (have receipts of course.) You can print out the list of donations with all items listed with dates. And it saves it to a file on your computer.
. Can compare to last years tax data (if you used this program last year)
. You can do a direct deposit, or have them send a check for refunds
. There is an amount that shows up in the right top that shows what you owe or are refunded. When you make changes to one area of the tax forms (like medical, charity, etc) it updates the Refund/Owed

{CONS}
. A Register Product screen pops when I open it but went away when I clicked ""Don't Register."" Not a big deal at all really, but it is the only thing I can think of that I didn't like. I do not want more emails or junk mail.

I did that and found it easily handled my complicated tax information.  Stock trades on two accounts were downloaded to a tax document file and feed into the program with no problem.  A Schwab stock account had to be entered manually.  Every trade entered had to be opened, and questions answered to clarify the entry before it was complete. Last year each group of trades could be listed by the account.  This year they are all lumped together, but the totals checked out.

The first year takes the longest to get everything entered in, but after that, subsequent years go a lot faster because the program just uses your previous return files.  On that note, make sure you backup and/or keep the previous years file somewhere handy.  It will save you a headache or two.

I downloaded the program here and e-filed our return the same day. The free e-file is quick and easy.",Simply Better
65464,5,H&R Block,47.8666666666667,"01 1, 2012","I have been a long-time TaxCut / H&R Block user and continue to appreciate the value this software provides when compared to the cost of the alternative (TurboTax).  I have used both, and honestly the user interface and usage differences between the two are negligible.  The layout, organization and functionality are fairly standard when compared to previous years, so expect consistency.

The fact that H&R Block has the cheaper overall software, cheaper state e-file, and that state returns are actually included WITH the software purchase is a major plus.  I am an employee owner at an S-Corp and have to file in multiple states.  Doing this with TurboTax would be prohibitively expensive.

If I have to pick one con, it would be Deduction Pro 2011.  We work hard to maximize our deductions, so an easier user interface for calculating sales tax and estimating the value of our donations would be nice.  This is the one area where TurboTax carries the advantage.  With TurboTax the donation valuation functionality is included within the software, whereas with H&R Block you have to go online to use their Deduction Pro and port over the results.  It isn't a major negative (as I've rated the product 5 stars), but if there is one thing to fix, this is it.

As far as purchasing goes, I decided this year not to play the waiting game by pouncing on price fluctuations and rebates, and just to buy through Amazon.  Purchased for $32 and downloaded straight to my computer.  Easy, relaxing, and a price I'm happy paying.  I'll buy this way from now on.","Excellent Product, Even Better Price"
65465,5,H&R Block,47.8666666666667,"12 9, 2011","I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both TaxCut and TurboTax to compare. I found that TurboTax did not do anything better than TaxCut while costing consistently more. In addition, I like the option of being able to file 5 free Federal e-files as I do taxes for other relatives who are less computer savvy.

H&R Block software also wins if compared to the free on-line options. I don't like using the on-line tax programs for two reasons (1) I don't want my financial data to be on someone's web site (2) free offers include the Federal tax only.

This year I used a digital download for the first time rather than a boxed version. I liked the security of having a physical CD in case I need to re-install on another computer several years down the road. But you are supposed to be able to download the software again to a different computer and when the boxed version was not available I went digital.

Downloading the software was easy, however during the install I got an error registering the software.  When I started the software it immediately gave me a prompt to enter a key-code which (the prompt said) I should have received in the email after purchasing the software.  The email I received from Amazon contained no such key-code.  I had to call Amazon support and they told me that this information can be found following these steps
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

Once this was done the rest of the software functions well. In fact it looked more polished than in prior years. I always had minor display problems because I use large fonts and they never scaled quite right.  This year everything displayed perfectly.

I read one review which mentioned a problem with seeing selection boxes.  The problem there most likely caused by low screen resolution.  Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher.  At a lower resolution, there will be problem with display such as not seeing selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

I did a preliminary tax return and below are my observations.

1. H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary.

2. Copy and Paste from Interview screens is not possible. Sometimes I wish to do it for some issue as a reminder to myself. My solution is to do PrintScreen (holding ctl key, shift key, and PrintScreen key at the same time). This generates an image of the screen, which I paste into paint or photo editing software which I can print or save for later.

3. I don't use the default location for the tax returns, as I want to my backup program to back up only the data not the software itself. The software does not  initially remember this new location on startup, it tells me I have no returns.  I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it does remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

4. Some forms (such as foreign tax credit over the limit to be directly on 1040) require entering data manually.  This year the foreign tax credit form is some what automated, when you hit next button it takes you to the next place on the form you need to fill out (last your you were just presented the form to fill out on your own). This form is not that hard to do manually as this form does not change year to year.

5. I use large font option on my monitor display and in the past had display issues (some things were displayed on top of each other). This year all forms displayed properly with this option. This is the first time in all the years I've used H&R Block software that I have no complaint about the display and did not need to change my monitor settings just to do the tax preparation. Nice!

6. H&R Block charges $19.95 to e-file each state return. Of course, this charge can be avoided by printing the forms and mailing them in.

7. In prior years the package include DeductionPro software. This year, like last year, this software is only available as an online tool. I will not use software that requires me to put my financial data on their site, and DeductionPro wants to import the data to H&R web site, so I will not be using it. Disappointing.

8. The price on this package changes day to day. I found a nice tools that shows history of Amazon prices and allows you to generate an email alert when the price reaches our desired price range.  If you enter ""price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, it has the word camel in the name.  I find this tool very helpful.  I purchased this package for $31, last year I saw the prices fluctuate between $25 and the list price of $44.99.

9.  For folks trying to download State Forms before January 16, 2012. The state forms are not available for download until January 16 for most states.
If you go to the Software Update Center on H&R website you will see a section called State Updates. Under there you there is a link called ""Forms Available"". If you click on that, it will show a table that shows availability of forms for each State.  Right now (last checked on 1/6/2011) none of them are available.  I called about my state (Massachusetts) and they told me that most state forms will become available for download on January 16. In the software package, select State Tab and click the button that is called ""Buy""  (a little scary since we already paid for it) but then ""buy""  will turn into ""update"" and when the forms will become available they will be downloaded to your computer.

10. ** ERROR ALERT ** 1/16/12 Version of Massachusetts state return contained an error that was corrected in 1/24/12 update.
If you owed taxes on your 2010 State return and paid owed tax in 2011, this payment was incorrectly included in Line 36 on the MA Form 1 as an amount withheld in 2011. This overstates the amount paid to the State for the 2011 tax year. This error has been reported to H&R and corrected in 1/24/12 update. Thank you to Tech Impaired to spotted it and reported to H&R!

I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. The interview process is helpful in reminding you things you might have forgotten. On-line help is useful.  2011 H&R Block package appears more polished and has a number of improvements to a couple of small pet peeves I had in the past.  So I am quite pleased with it and recommend it!

This was what had caused the problem with Turbo.  It also took me through itemized deductions, interest and dividends easily.

The interface isn't as graphically appealing as Turbo Tax, but it's easy to use and did my taxes accurately.

I've used H&R Block for a few years after having poor experiences with Turbo Tax (purchased that software and had nothing but problems installing it and updating it).

H&R Block software is easy to use and has never let me down.  This year was no exception.  I downloaded the software, did my entire tax return (state and federal WITH itemized deductions including mortgage deductions and charitable donations), and filed with both the IRS and Oregon all in about an hour.  My poor accountant has lost a client for the fourth straight year: It takes me more time to drive to his office and fill out his forms than it takes me to use this software-- and it costs far less.

I would recommend this software to anyone.  It makes doing taxes bearable.","If you're reading this now, you are late to file your taxes..."

65583,5,H&R Block,47.8666666666667,"01 18, 2012","This product gets my ultimate 5 star review (which I don't do often).  The reason being is because of its ease of use, affordability and accessibility.  I started out using the competition:  TurboTax.  I never thought after using it for the first couple of years I would make the switch.  Just like any other software you tend to stick to what you know works.  However, last year I made the decision to buy H&R Block 2010 and found it to be first and foremost, cheaper than the competition, and just as simple to use.  My choice was obvious as this year it was again on average $10.00 cheaper than Turbotax and in addition made it even easier to use by carrying over last years information.  I love the fact that you can just download the software here on Amazon therefore eliminating the need to wait for your disc to arrive & wondering when its going to come.  I'm planning to start my own business this year and I will be buying the H&R Block Business tax software as soon as necessary.  Why pay more for an equivalent product?  It's not like TurboTax will get you more $$$ on your return.  The only reason I can see going for the competition is if you already had it in years past.  I look ahead into the future though, if I had to pay $10.00 more per year for pretty much the same product/different brand and did my taxes for the next 50 years of my life that's $500.00 extra saved in my lifetime.",Great tax software!

That complaint? The price. TurboTax has been slowly rising in price every year for the past 8 years to the point where, when H&R Block's software went on sale for LESS THAN HALF the cost of TurboTax I thought it was time to branch out. I couldn't be happier.

The interface is easy to navigate, it asks questions like TurboTax does, provides detailed information at my fingertips, imported from my 2010 TurboTax file with no problems, and has been just as easy and intuitive as TurboTax. As a direct competitor, H&R Block have done everything right. They've created a product that is just as good as their competitor, but they're selling it for a price that is much easier to afford.

Highly recommended.",All the good of TurboTax at half the price
65592,5,H&R Block,54.5333333333333,"12 9, 2011","I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both TaxCut and TurboTax to compare. I found that TurboTax did not do anything better than TaxCut while costing consistently more. In addition, I like the option of being able to file 5 free Federal e-files as I do taxes for other relatives who are less computer savvy.  The files with the return are recognized by both Windows PC and Mac.  The data can be imported from a return made on PC computer by copying the files to the Mac and then importing them.

H&R Block software also wins if compared to the free on-line options. I don't like using the on-line tax programs for two reasons (1) I don't want my financial data to be on someone's web site (2) free offers include the Federal tax only.

This year I used a digital download for the first time rather than a boxed version. I liked the security of having a physical CD in case I need to re-install on another computer several years down the road. But you are supposed to be able to download the software again to a different computer and when the boxed version was not available I went digital.

Downloading the software was easy, however during the install I got an error registering the software.  When I started the software it immediately gave me a prompt to enter a key-code which (the prompt said) I should have received in the email after purchasing the software.  The email I received from Amazon contained no such key-code.  I had to call Amazon support and they told me that this information can be found following these steps
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

Once this was done the rest of the software functions well. In fact it looked more polished than in prior years. I always had minor display problems because I use large fonts and they never scaled quite right.  This year everything displayed perfectly.

I read one review which mentioned a problem with seeing selection boxes.  The problem there most likely caused by low screen resolution.  Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher.  At a lower resolution, there will be problem with display such as not seeing selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

I did a preliminary tax return and below are my observations.

1. H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary.

2. Copy and Paste from Interview screens is not possible. Sometimes I wish to do it for some issue as a reminder to myself. My solution is to do PrintScreen (holding ctl key, shift key, and PrintScreen key at the same time). This generates an image of the screen, which I paste into paint or photo editing software which I can print or save for later.

3. I don't use the default location for the tax returns, as I want to my backup program to back up only the data not the software itself. The software does not  initially remember this new location on startup, it tells me I have no returns.  I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it does remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

4. Some forms (such as foreign tax credit over the limit to be directly on 1040) require entering data manually.  This year the foreign tax credit form is some what automated, when you hit next button it takes you to the next place on the form you need to fill out (last your you were just presented the form to fill out on your own). This form is not that hard to do manually as this form does not change year to year.

5. I use large font option on my monitor display and in the past had display issues (some things were displayed on top of each other). This year all forms displayed properly with this option. This is the first time in all the years I've used H&R Block software that I have no complaint about the display and did not need to change my monitor settings just to do the tax preparation. Nice!

6. H&R Block charges $19.95 to e-file each state return. Of course, this charge can be avoided by printing the forms and mailing them in.

7. In prior years the package include DeductionPro software. This year, like last year, this software is only available as an online tool. I will not use software that requires me to put my financial data on their site, and DeductionPro wants to import the data to H&R web site, so I will not be using it. Disappointing.

8. The price on this package changes day to day. I found a nice tools that shows history of Amazon prices and allows you to generate an email alert when the price reaches our desired price range.  If you enter ""price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, it has the word camel in the name.  I find this tool very helpful.  I purchased this package for $31, last year I saw the prices fluctuate between $25 and the list price of $44.99.

9.  For folks trying to download State Forms before January 16, 2012. The state forms are not available for download until January 16 for most states.
If you go to the Software Update Center on H&R website you will see a section called State Updates. Under there you there is a link called ""Forms Available"". If you click on that, it will show a table that shows availability of forms for each State.  Right now (last checked on 1/6/2011) none of them are available.  I called about my state (Massachusetts) and they told me that most state forms will become available for download on January 16. In the software package, select State Tab and click the button that is called ""Buy""  (a little scary since we already paid for it) but then ""buy""  will turn into ""update"" and when the forms will become available they will be downloaded to your computer.

10. ** ERROR ALERT ** 1/16/12 Version of Massachusetts state return contained an error that was corrected in 1/24/12 update.
If you owed taxes on your 2010 State return and paid owed tax in 2011, this payment was incorrectly included in Line 36 on the MA Form 1 as an amount withheld in 2011. This overstates the amount paid to the State for the 2011 tax year. This error has been reported to H&R and corrected in 1/24/12 update.

I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. The interview process is helpful in reminding you things you might have forgotten. On-line help is useful.  2011 H&R Block package appears more polished and has a number of improvements to a couple of small pet peeves I had in the past.  So I am quite pleased with it and recommend it!

I bought this product because my partner needed tax software that came with support and help for investments and stocks. Turbo Tax was not only more expensive, it didn't have this key feature she really needed. For a fraction of the price of what I paid last year, I got peace of mind this year. It took me about an hour to get through the software, but it was easy to use throughout and I never really felt lost.

I'm looking forward to using H&R Block at home in the the future. This was my first experience doing my own taxes at home, and it really couldn't have been easier. Highly recommend. No issues at all on my 2007 MacBook Pro.",Taxes For Dummies!

Other reviewers mentioned it being difficult to find the Product Key, but when I downloaded it, the Amazon Downloader had a ""View Keys"" button when it completed, which takes me to a copy of the product keys which are saved in the same folder where it downloaded the software.

I can't believe how easy this program made doing my federal and state taxes. The program is almost like a ""taxes for dummies"" and tells you how to do everything from entering your W-2 info to helping you determine which forms to use for more complicated situations (for me it was the Rental Depreciation Schedule). At the end of the process the program performs an accuracy check and tells what mistakes need to be fixed and whether you might be at risk for an audit. The program includes 5 free federal filings if you want to share with friends and family. The program gave me timely updates to schedules that I needed that weren't available when I initially started filing and it gave me my state updates as soon as those were available as well.

  If you download messes up, you need to re-download it, or you lose the key code, try the following....

 A.  After you login to Amazon, click on ""Your Account"" (located in upper right corner of web page).
 B.  Scroll down to the ""Digital Management"" section.
 C.  Under the ""Digital Management"" section, click on ""Your Games And Software Library"".
 D.  Then you'll see your H&R Block program that you purchased along with your key code.
 E.  Next, just click on the yellow ""DOWNLOAD"" button to the right of the description, and follow the instructions from there.

I installed this program on 2 different computers, both with different operating systems, and it works just fine on both. I hope this information helps.

  Thankyou !!

(Follow Up on 1-1-2012) - One review stated that the pixel resolution might need to be raised to 1024 x 768 to correct display problems. Just for kicks, I lowered my pixel resolution and then ran the H&R Block software to see what would happen, and the other review was right. First problem was the ""display error"" boxes that popped up. After I got through that, the whole program graphics were messed up and I had no selection boxes to click on. I re-set my pixel resolution back to where it used to be, restarted my computer, and then everything worked great again. I'd say that if you can't raise your pixel resolution on your computer, then you should not do the ""download version"". Maybe the c.d. version will work, but you should check into that before purchasing.

It imports the previous years data so it knows what taxes were paid/returned and how to account for that.  It also promots for things similiar to the year before so you don't miss anything.

Say you want to get back to a certain place and go through some questions again, since perhaps you only answered them closely but not exactly the first time, you have to step back through sections (such as income or expenses) completely to get there.  It's ok but takes a little time.

The videos they provide on training and explaining are helpful and nicely done, I like watching those each year to make sure I stay up on the new laws and features.","Use it every year, less here thay buying the version they mail."
65618,5,H&R Block,55.9,"02 12, 2012","I've been using Computer Tax Programs for over 20 years. I have Rental Property and Retirement Income plus Charitable Contributions and home Interest. Since I retired from KY State Government I don't have to pay Ky State Income Tax on Income up to a certain amount.

Not saying some haven't been easy in the past but this one this year was the easiest one I've used. I imported the 20 depreciable propertys and all the info from last year, ALL of it and in the past many of the Programs wouldn't import my own Name and adress.

How to deal with the income reported to the IRS under the 1099-K form

To make sure we pay all of our taxes the Feds have added a new 1099 form.  If you receive more than 20K a year from your Merchant Account provider (The one who processes your customers credit card purchases and deposits the money in your bank account) or  E-bay, Amazon, etc and or had more than 200 transactions then you will have received one in the mail.  Those companies are required to send the IRS and you a 1099-K form. If you file your taxes and don't acknowledge the 1099-K form information you will be sent a nasty note from the IRS letting you know you underpaid, penalties, threat of jail time etc.

The bad news is H&R block has NOT included how to deal with this form in their software. I called Customer Service and they told me to download the form from the IRS website and fill it out by hand and that I will not be able to e-file. That kind of defeats the purpose of buying software plus it will totally screw up my return.

So I did more research.

What a NIGHTMARE!!

In the Schedule C instructions on the IRS website it says the following about how to report your 1099K form. [...]

""New merchant card reporting requirements. We added new lines 1a and 1b to implement reporting of gross receipts received via merchant card (credit and debit cards) and third party network payments. However, for 2011, the IRS has deferred the requirement to report these amounts. Therefore, enter zero on line 1a and report all gross receipts on line 1b,

 INCLUDING any income reported to you on Form 1099-K

, Merchant Card and Third Party Network Payments (but excluding any W-2 income reportable on line 1c)""

Your 1099K form is the gross amount you charged the credit cards for. It does NOT deduct tips, sales tax, etc that you had to pay out!!!!!!

Of course you should have been keeping track of all those payouts and have reported them to the IRS so you can deduct them on your schedule C.

What would simply things is if a law was passed that forced all federally elected officials to fill out their own taxes by hand in front of C-span cameras. And for the IRS to audit all of their returns. C-span would then capture their reaction when the IRS handed them a tax penalty in the amount of 10 times the amount they over or underpaid.

I bet in less than a year we would have a simple tax system again.

So bottom line is just make sure you include the amount in line 1b and take all your deductions in the rest of schedule C.",No place to enter your 1099-K Form

""This interview isn't final.  Visit the Update Center for release dates.""

Apparently, there is an update schedule for released for January 10th, but doesn't guarantee that this would be ""final interview"".

So, buyer beware!

Not taking any stars off since Congress literally just passed the laws that will affect the tax return.  However, getting early start this year is probably not going to help, especially if IRS decides to delay cutting checks for returns in order to keep treasury in check.

Please follow my review there.  Thanks.",tax forms not  yet updated
65636,5,H&R Block,161.32,"12 1, 2012","I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both TaxCut and TurboTax to compare. I found that TurboTax did not do anything better than TaxCut while costing consistently more. In addition, I like the option of being able to file 5 free Federal e-files as I do taxes for other relatives who are less computer savvy.

If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

I just finished a preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until January 10, 2013.
Note that I purchased H&R Block Deluxe plus State, and in this review I am including only the review of the federal forms. The federal forms part of the product are identical, of course, whether one buys the State add-on or not.

1. H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary.
It would have better if they waited until the financial information is entered and offered the Premium version only to those for whom it might make sense.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividents, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations. This year I had to do both, and I found the guidance to be sufficient to complete the forms.

2. As of 11/19/2012 videos for tax law changes were not available yet (the prompt said coming soon).

3. Minor pet peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on ""learn more"" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which words to use locate the relevant topics.

4. Good news: DeductionPro 2012 is now integrated into H&R Block, you no longer need to go to H&R web site.

5. H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example from mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

6. Copy and Paste from Interview screens is not possible. Sometimes I wish to do it for some issue as a reminder to myself. My solution is to do PrintScreen (holding ctl key, shift key, and PrintScreen key at the same time). This generates an image of the screen, which I paste into paint or photo editing software which I can print or save for later.

7. I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

8. I use large font option on my monitor display and in the past had display issues (some things were displayed on top of each other). This year all forms displayed properly with this option. Nice!

9. H&R Block Deluxe entitles you to 5 free federal state e-files.

10. The price on this package changes day to day. I found a nice tools that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter ""price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, it has the word camel in the name. I find this tool very helpful. I just looked up that the price last year during the tax preparation season hit the $20 mark on three different dates. You can set up an alert tool to email you when your desired price has been reached.

11. A note about digital download key-code
-----------------------------------------
I run into a glitch a solution to which I want to include

After I installed the software and started it for the first time it prompted me to enter a key-code. The prompt said that I should have received in the email after purchasing the software, however the email I received from Amazon did not contained a key-code. I had to call Amazon support and they told me that this information can be found following these steps
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

12. Update 12/10/2012.  I received a question if H&R allows to install the software on two PCs.  I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic ""Installing Software on Another Computer""

 There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.
  Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer.
  Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.
  The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, ""Can I install the software on a second computer?""
  Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate.
  You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail.
  Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

13. Update 12/18/2012.  Adding another answer to great question to share with everyone.
Q:  Is there an audit check which marks problems with red flags?
A:  At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags , and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

14. Update 2/7/2013. I received a question if I had any problem doing updates of the software.
I have performed several updates without problems.  If you have a firewall, the firewall prompts with a question if you trust the software and you need to reply ""yes"". If you say no, the install will be rolled back.  If you accidentally reply ""No"" to this prompt, I would recommend uninstalling the software. Then installing it again, and then trying another update.  Alternatively you can deactivate the firewall during the install.

I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. The interview process is helpful in reminding you things you might have forgotten. 2012 H&R Block package addressed a couple of my old pet peeves (for example, integration with DeductionPro). So I am quite pleased with it and recommend it!

It wasn't always like that in previous versions but the last couple of years at least it has been much improved.

I was not aware that there were such kind of exceptions to electronic filing. Needless to say I was happy I did not waste my time doing something that was not going to work.

I was using TurboTax for years, but when I had a problem with a calculation error in THEIR software that caused me to have to pay penalties and late fees, I reached out for help.  Even though I purchased audit protection, I could NOT get anyone to talk to me since I wasn't being audited.  TurboTax does all their complaint resolutions by EMAIL.  I had NO ONE to talk to.  Their email simply said that the matter has been resolved (by them apparently, certainly not me) I was told to resubmit my issue if I wasn't satisfied.  I was NOT, I resubmitted, went through the same BS 3 more times, never from the same person, no cross reference, even though I copied them in on everything.  Their software error (did a calculation using 1% when it should have been 10%---THEIR ERROR - I did not set the tables, they did) it was not my fault, but they denied everything, said it was my error, again I did not set up the software to calculate 1% when it should have been 10%, I had no way of changing it or even knowing it was wrong....From that day on I vowed never to use TurboTax and I got my whole family to switch to HR Block, anybody asks me about TurboTax - I say stay away.  I find HR Block easier to use and easier to get questions answered with their online help center.  Everything is explained and they have an 800 number if I get really stuck, but I haven't had to use it.  Even though I was one of those Taxpayers that had used the Form for the College Credit, HR Block kept me informed as to what was happening and when the issue was going to be resolved with the IRS.

Simple choice, save $19.99 and put a 49 stamp on it! Since I usually owe taxes anyway, & don't want to give the IRS my card number, so I'm in no hurry to get it in before 4/15! When I used to go to a store front H&R Block to get my taxes done, I never got out of there for less than $120. It was a several hour process and the tax preparers were using the same software!

All in all, it is very easy to use, and has cut my tax filing time significantly.  I am able to use the ""At Home"" software to fill out tax returns for multiple people, something I am often asked to do.

I don't deduct much since I don't own a home.

H&R Block Tax Software does a great job of going through every section step-by-step. The program does a great job of providing additional information for any section or question they ask.  The calculations have been accurate for me all three years. I usually file in March, and I also run through other online programs to verify that they calculate the same refund or amount owed.

The program installed easily without any problems on my AMD triple-core PC with 8 GB of RAM. It should install on most computers easily, as long as yours isn't completely outdated. It imported my data from the previous year. And when it was time to file, it did it without any problems. I love this software. I also loved the Turbo Tax software when I was using it years ago. But since H&R Block software has been cheaper, I just pickup this one.

As for the costs, the federal program is included and e-file is also free. The state program is included, but the e-file is what you have to pay for if you do that, and that's usually around twenty.

Since the software has come out I have only had 2 problems with my taxes - one was caused by my employer messing up our W-2s which required me filing an amended return (not as easy as a primary return and with some clarify issues in the software because of the use of the primary return phasing in the queries) and the other was related to multiple-state incomes and how income is treated differently in different states.

The programs are simple step by step and instructional, however you still must read every step not to miss out on or leave out important topics.

I've been happy with the software every year since then. The first year I did the online download through Amazon and it went quickly. Installation was straightforward as it is with the actual disc. In fact, the whole process went quickly and it filled in and calculated our taxes. It was able to handle the HSA account info I had for two of the year's accurately and without a glitch. This was what had caused the problem with Turbo. It also took me through itemized deductions, interest and dividends easily.

The interface isn't as graphically appealing as Turbo Tax, but it's easy to use and did my taxes accurately. I was able to download the state version for free and it took less than 5 minutes for it to install, get my info from the federal taxes and fill it out.

It was the cheaper alternative and I like how state software is paired with their federal software.  All in all I like it and don't intend to switch.  I will offer a piece of advice.  When ordering the software, take care an notice what year it's for and whether it includes state software or not.  My first attempt at ordering this, I erroneously order it for 2012 (an e-version).  I saw my error just as I hit the send button to complete the order.

Does include up to 5 free e files of Federal returns.  Overall it is excellent value and does the job well.

The first software update - which delivers the federal forms release - isn't out, yet, but I've installed the software and begun working with the interview. As a single taxpayer with investments in stocks and mutual funds, I exercise a subset of the features that most folks don't, and H&R Block's software handled them just fine last year; I expect them to, this year, as well.

I use Quicken Rental Property Manager to do my record keeping and TaxCut Premium (the name that Block used for this software for years) to do my taxes. The data export/import process is very simple and correctly imports my data for Schedule E as individual properties, something that older versions of TaxCut could not do; in the past TaxCut lumped all of the properties into one property on Schedule E. Since I had used TaxCut in previous years, TaxCut also imported my personal data from last year so a lot of my return was filled in before I ever really started working on it. I have found that if I spend the time to make sure that the Quicken data is correctly categorized before I import the data into TaxCut, I can do the actual return in only a few hours, a very reasonable length of time considering the complexity of my return. I am very pleased. I tried TurboTax last year since it is made by the same company as Quicken, but it didn't seem do anything more for me or be easier than TaxCut so I never even finished the TurboTax return and used TaxCut to make my last year's filing.

PROS:
First, the software was surprisingly easy to download and get started. I was thinking it would be a headache. It took minutes and went smoothly.

Second, their interface is user friendly. They guide you through the process with questions as if you were in an office talking to a tax preparer (they call it interviews).

After a little time getting to know the software, I found it very easy to see where I can look for answers to questions or go back and change my data.

Lastly, and most importantly, the program leads you through all your deductions so you don't leave anything out. And their accuracy review was very thorough. They even asked me to go back and mark a checkbox I missed.

It made me feel confident that when I e-filed, I was filing an accurate form.

Also, I did use their Chat service to field a complicated question, and that helped me considerably in doing my taxes correctly. I think that service adds a lot of value for the price of a software program.

CONS:

Yes, you do pay that extra $19.99 if you want to efile your state taxes (which I didn't mind but wanted to point it out so people know that will be there). I also had to do some research on my own to answer a tax question for the state so it seems more thorough for federal. The research I did actually helped me understand the tax issue better so perhaps that was for the best. I am more informed on the issue.

To sum up:

Yes, I recommend this program. I even enjoyed using it! Next year, depending on my time, I'd either use this program or go to their offices and have them do it. Either way, I will feel confident that I have my taxes done accurately and will get a good return.",Happy with this tax software!

The program is easy to use, clear and simple. I will definitely use it again next year.

Here are a few areas that need improvement.

1) I tired to chat with an expert, but the website button to connect to chat didn't do anything. I suspect it was because I was using Chrome, and it only works with IE. Lame.

2) When the program reviews your data, and tells you to go back and check an entry, you can't jump back to the review screen. You have to step through all the intervening steps to get to the end again. It only takes about 60 seconds, but it's a little annoying.

3) When I registered for the site, then tried to sign back in, it said my password was wrong. Maybe it was my mistake, but I'm not sure. I wonder if it hiccupped on Chrome again.

66180,5,H&R Block,80.99,"02 5, 2014","I've used different tax programs over the years, but I've been using H&R Block for the last 8 or so (the equivalent Turbotax program seems to be more expensive on the whole), and have had an excellent experience year-in and year-out.  I ordered from Amazon this year for the convenience and the opportunity to get it in ""frustration-free packaging"" (essentially a very stiff envelopeno DVD-style plastic case).

The single-biggest benefit for me is that the program generates all forms and performs all needed calculations as you import/input your financial information.  You even get a ""play-by-play"" view of your tax refund (or bill) as you proceed through the interview so that you can see the impact of entering income, deductions, etc.  In earlier years, I relied heavily on the built-in tax resources (the FAQ's are contextual with each screen at every point during the interview process), but our situation is more predictable now and completing our taxes doesn't take as long as it used to.  Even so, I was able to finish everything, including printing the form and all supporting documents, inside of an hour.  Completing my state taxes took another 30 minutes at most.

You can e-file up to 5 federal returns with this programperfect if you happen to have multiple filers in the same household (think married filing separately, a teen filing his/her own return, or multiple non-married people living together).  Another benefit of the program is that it can give you a window into your tax situation for 2014, and enhance your ability to be proactive (e.g., adjust withholding, pay estimated tax).  It helps to be organized (I keep a file throughout the year with receipts, canceled checks, etc.), but there is no doubt in my mind that this program saves a huge amount of time for what could be a very painful process.",SAVES ME SO MUCH TIME AND AGGRAVATION

The best/worst part is, if you used the H&R Block software the year previous, you can carry over any information, which speeds the process along quite well.  This, sort of, commits you to H&R Block year after year, just to save the time of bringing over the previous year's information.

Yeah, I fell into that trap, if you want to call it a trap.  I haven't used any other software in such a long time, I cannot tell you if Block is better than the other guys.  The promise of Block having your back if you screw up and get an audit, is reassuring.",The Necessary Evil

 INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

 If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you download it. The key-code can be located two ways.
Option 1: After my download finished the install started automatically offering me a choice of two links ""View Keys"" and ""Install"". When I selected view key-code after a fairly long pause it displayed my key-code in a browser window.
Option 2: You can locate it in your Amazon account:
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

 Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs?
I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic ""Installing Software on Another Computer""

I quote the FAQ answer below:
""There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.
Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer.
Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.
The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, ""Can I install the software on a second computer?""
Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate.
You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.""

 WHAT IS INCLUDED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I purchased a digital download version of H&R Block Deluxe plus State. The Federal portion of these two packages is identical, so I am cross posting my review of the Federal portion of the software for both packages .

H&R Block Deluxe entitles you to 5 free federal e-files. You can print and mail as many returns as you want, there is no limit on printing.

 GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until January 9, 2014.

 H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version. That would have been useful.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations. Last year I had to do both and I found the guidance in Deluxe package was sufficient to complete the forms.

 Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on ""learn more"" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.

 H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

 DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC. You no longer need to enter this information on H&R web site. I prefer having this information locally on my PC for better security. The change from web site to local PC was introduced last year and I was happy to see that this change is here to stay.

 I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

 I use large font option on my monitor display and in the past years had display issues on some forms (text boxes were display overlapping each other on some forms). This year all forms displayed properly.

 I usually purchase tax software as early as possible to help me with end year tax planning. However, if timing is not important to you be aware that the price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter ""Amazon price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word camel in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached. During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $44.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.

 At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

 Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?
Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.

 Update: Several people asked me via comments if Schedule C is included in Deluxe edition because it is not explicitly mentioned in the description.  Schedule C form is included and covered in the interview.

I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. I keep coming back because it works well for the tax forms I need to do and it is less expensive than TurboTax. If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.

I also used it to file my 90+ old mother's return.,One of th best Tax prep programs available
66266,5,H&R Block,60.99,"02 3, 2014","The basic version of the H&R Block tax software is best for people who have simple tax situations.  If you operate a business such as a sole proprietorship, S corporation, or partnership then this is not for you.  Pass through gains and losses are not covered in this program.  This is best suited for people who have W2, interest, dividend, or some sort of retirement income as their main means of making a living.  It does cover contributions to IRAs, 401Ks, tuition tax credits, etc.  In other words, if you have a job and get a W2 then odds are this will work for you.

The program itself is very easy to use and has user friendly menus/layout.  The questions are asked in plain english instead of jargon an accountant would use.  There is also an update that is automated for the most part and very easy to use.  This comes into play if and when the IRS or congress enact new rules or regulations that are retroactive to the past year in terms of tax issues.  H&R block software will download and install the required changes to the programs and associated forms as needed.

I have seen basic tax preparation services cost as much as $50 from both the chain stores who do tax work and from registered tax preparers.  A CPA that has experience and is worth hiring is over $150 per hour.  So, for $15 you can not go wrong with this program.  The only suggestion I would make for security reasons is to never store your tax return on the hard drive of the computer.  Use a dedicated external thumb drive that costs a few dollars to store the return.  This way, if your machine is infected with a virus later down the line it will be harder to steal information like your SS# or birthdate.  Yes, keystroke history can be stolen and analyzed so there is no fool proof way.  But not having the raw data on the drive in your computer is better.",Excellent Tax Software; It is Simple

The software loaded with no issues.  However, when I was done downloading and opened the program, it suggested I download the latest update and the download would not work.  However, you can go to the website and download it manually, and the worked just fine.

Last year I found out because I had a big tax problem.  Through my own stupidity, I managed to end up owing the Treasury Department a wickedly large amount of money.  I had used the H&R Block software to produce my tax return but was not happy with the result so I went to a large CPA firm hoping for a better outcome.

I like using the same product each year, as the learning curve for new software seems to be getting steeper.

This includes the CD with installation key for one computer - no box, no manual.  The online updates work just fine (the disc never has the final filing forms etc.)  There was an immediate update when installed, and a final filing version update on Feb. 6 - so internet access is required.  E-filing for five returns (federal) is included.  They have some hand-holding support, but I have not used it.

The software uses an interview process, but it is possible to jump around to various spots if you wish.  By following the interview step-by-step, you can be sure to cover all the items which may apply to your situation.  There are tutorial videos and such, which load from a website.  They would be helpful for some people and some topics - you can choose to watch or skip, they don't force them on you.

The printed forms work OK (for your own records if you e-file.)  If you want to mail it in, the forms meet the IRS requirements.  Save your printed copies, save the CD, and save a data backup in case the IRS needs to talk about it (seven years, I think.)

Did a payroll tax return on it (940 , W-3 and W-2s).  Just make sure you load the personal return SW even if you're only interested in the business returns.  The personal SW loads the updates into the business SW.  The 2013 version loads personal 1040 SW  first with no option to load the business SW first.(Good).  Also, adjust the screen resolution to the box's specs if you notice some bottom tabs not printing (in forms entry mode).

This software was very easy to use and I would highly recommend it.  Granted I didn't have to call customer support for assistance but then again, as far as I'm concerned, the software asked simple concise questions that were easy to answer so there was no need to contact them.

Having long used it for my small business, personal, and rental property returns, it has always proven very comprehensive and quite thorough for both federal and (Virginia) state returns preparation, at all levels of difficulty.  The user ""interview"" interface is perfect for me, and i find it quite simple to access all the forms and schedules, and my actual return worksheets for making manual entries and corrections, as well.  They push any available updates out to you at program start up, and the update process is quick and painless. If there is an occasional glitch or hiccup, of which I have only ever experienced  a couple, their customer support is top notch, and they quickly work to resolve any issues.

The Premium program is similar to the Deluxe and Basic. But the Business program is different. It has its own icon, it keeps documents in a different folder. It's a little less friendly than the Premium/Deluxe in that the interview doesn't seem to hold your hands like the others. I was easily able to create a 1041 return, along with its K-1. I was unable to e-file it. Maybe because I'm not a business. It wanted to know my EFIN for e-filing. I do like that it has unlimited chat support.","Actually, 2 two programs in one"

I can complete Federal, State and Trust (1041) tax returns.  My entire family can use it to file their individual tax returns.
The questionnaire walkthrough to gather info for filing is easy.  I like the electronic filing (except the trust must be mailed).  I really like the ability to save in PDF format which helps me keep copies for future use.

The only thing I don't like is the effort it takes to go back and adjust previous entries.

That was main difference from the one you can buy in the stores.  For those of us who know how to use the product it is not an issue but for someone who has never used it before it could be a problem.

It is simple to follow through and get all the right forms completed.  It is a little tricky to find the ""basic"" version, since marketing focuses more on the more advanced packages that have extra features beyond my need.

My bank offers the other software to use online for free, but if you need anything more than a 1040-EZ, it costs you close to $50.  This one even includes (more than one) E-File for no extra charge.  If you own a business or have unusual investments or the like, you'll probably need to go with a more advanced version, but if you're a working stiff like me the Basic version works fine.

I have used H&R tax software since before the company used it and it was called Tax Cut.  I have always been happy with it but I have so many years of experience I prefer not to use the interview method of form completion for everything.  Having error and consistency checks is useful..  It is also good to have some forewarning if deductions might prompt an audit, although in the end you still need to put down the correct information even if it means dealing with the IRS later to defend what is claimed.

I would go back to doing my tax returns entirely by hand and calculator before spending the much higher price that Turbo Tax demands, but the convenience of avoiding careless mistakes, especially in math, make this software worth using.  If you also need to file a non-trivial state income tax form just be sure to buy a version that includes the state tax form.  I have no need for that though.  My state has no state income tax and my previous state had just simple modifications of what is on the 1040 to make that would not have justified paying even $1 more to get the state form.",H & R Block (years back known as Tax Cut) has been a consistently reliable product to avoid careless filign errors.

TurboTax management saw the results of their selfish decision, reversed their moronic decision, appologized to their customers and begged them to return.  I never returned to TurboTax.  Years before my sojourn with TurboTax, I had always purchased Parson Technology's Tax Preparation Software.  Then, TurboTax bought out Parson's Tax Preparation Software to eliminate the competition, forcing Parson's customers to buy from TurboTax.",H&R Block Tax Software Deluxe 2014.

TurboTax dropped the Form D from their Deluxe package which would have made it necessary for me to buy the TurboTax Premier.  IMO, the H&R Block software responds much faster and is much easier to navigate.  This software appears to be complete, provides Federal e-filing and includes one state software.  If you don't need the state, H&R Block has a separate package without the state for about $10.00 cheaper than this.  So far, I'm much happier with the H&R software.","Ohhh, much, much better!!"

All my information transferred over fine from the TT file that I had from last year.  The reason I switched is because I'm cheap.  The HRB software was $13 cheaper than the TT.  One major advantage of HRB is that it was MORE accurate than TT.  A friend let me borrow his copy of TT and I was able to compare them side by side.  I like TT's design better but for the most part they were equal.  Except when doing my state taxes.  I pay taxes to different cities in two different states.  According to my state I cannot claim those taxes paid to the other states' cities.  HRB figured that out.  However, TT said ""we'll get you more money even though it's not right"".  It took me a couple of days to get the answer as to who was right.  But after doing my own research as well as using the online help through HRB (which was great btw) HRB was right.  Which matters greatly.  Highly likely I'll use it again next year.",Easy filing taxes

For starters, Id been using Turbo-Tax forever and didn't really want to deal with the learning curve.  There really wasn't any.  I sat down and started to putz with it, figuring Id only start the preliminary set up.  It didn't take long for it to be done.  My previous tax documents imported easily, and I didn't have any of the quirky problems during installation that some folks have  mentioned (Windows 7 operating system, if that helps).  I used one free State return that was available to me, and like Turbo Tax was (don't know if it still is), you can E-file the Federal for free and pay for the state.  (I just printed the State and sent it the old-fashioned way, mail.)  Comparatively speaking, I think H&R nags you less to buy more stuff.

When they chose to change their product to make it less useful and more expensive without thinking of what makes their company work, their customers, I decided to start looking elsewhere.

I spent quite a bit of time reviewing the different products and determined that H&R Block would give me a similar experience to my prior product. I must say that I am completely happy and as long as H&R Block keeps their focus on the happiness and the pocketbooks of their customer, they have a customer for life. Very pleased with this product. It is very intuitive and straightforward. It asks questions, you answer them. It even took my information from last years return and uploaded it to this year.

With TT, I would usually be done in a few hours ( 4 or so). This year, with H&R, I was done in 2 hours flat. That makes me very happy, because, let's be honest, who really ""enjoys"" doing their taxes?","Better than TT, just keep a focus on the customer!"

The price increase on top of the bait and switch with the Deluxe version, followed by crocodile tears and the thoroughly inept handling of the aftermath was the final straw.  So although I was a 20-year customer of of TurboTax (I first began using it in 1994), I was pretty much forced to dispense with Intuit's nonsense once and for all and switch to another vendor.  I have to say, I am very pleasantly surprised with the H & R Block software and really wished I had made the change sooner, as it is demonstrably both better software and much cheaper to boot.

Though my returns were not too complicated this year, the software handled its tasks flawlessly.  Import from last year's TurboTax, income reporting, options trades, trust distributions, state taxes, property tax refund, and printing/filing all went off without a hitch.  I much prefer H & R Block's interface (I find the interview process is smoother and much less tedious than TurboTax).  The layout and menuing is cleaner, and it is extremely easy to locate any particular task or form at any time.  In short, the software is pretty much all one could ask for in a tax preparation program.","Great software, great price"

66964,5,H&R Block,47.3333333333333,"03 22, 2015","Around 1989, I was an early adopter of some do-it-yourself tax software from Chipsoft, called TurboTax.  I have since been a loyal user of that product for almost 30 years, until this year, when Intuit removed some useful schedules and wanted me to buy expensive upgrades to file essentially the same return as last year.
I decided to try H&R Block's software, and found it just as easy to use in most areas.  For the average person who itemizes deductions, this works great, and handled everything easily.
Block's software isn't as polished.  For example, when you create itemized lists to track multiple donations to the same organization, the lists aren't automatically linked to the computed cell, so you need to name your itemized lists (and including descriptions in the individual items - not just dates!).  Otherwise, when you want to go back to a particular organization to add a missing donation, you will find that right-clicking in the computed value and choosing ""Open Itemized list..."" gives you a lot of lists from which to choose, all with the same anonymous name, and when you open one, if you didn't describe and date the entry, you may wind up playing a guessing game to figure out which list went with with organization.
My assessment - basic functionality is all there, should meet most user's needs at significantly less cost than the same functionality in TurboTax.","Meets most needs without requiring ""Premium"" upgrade"

Some background, prior to the 20 years using software I did my taxes with manuals, pencil and calculator, so I do not need much guidance so far as the process.  Am able to review my printed taxes to insure the result look reasonable. I found HR  updates were faster, movement through forms more direct and logical than TT.  TT spends more time asking questions and where as HR asks you to check a block and offers a ""learn more"" help screen. So if you know what you are going HR will work fine, if you are new to taxes or are using new forms TT is better.  I am retired so I only used Schedule B and D.

If the price and program schedules were the same I would give TT  five stars and HR four stars.  I have given HR the extra star because of the price.  If I had purchase TT 2014 Deluxe his year with its limitations I would have given it one or two stars.

After enough research to assure myself that others were having good experiences with Block, I decided to give it a try.  The 2014 Deluxe version of Block easily uploaded my prior years information from TurboTax (Whew!  Off to a good start).  The series of tax related questions that followed seemed more direct and less encumbered with advertising and urges to upgrade than the TurboTax version.  Overall, I am very pleased with the 2014 Deluxe version of the HR Block tax software.  Will be using them again next year.

I also use Quickbooks, which has been an excellent product from the same company (Intuit) that publishes TurboTax.  Unfortunately, Intuit has been taking aggressive steps to reduce the capacity of my QB so I would have to ""upgrade,"" e.g., they terminated my ability to download/upload information directly from my bank.  Seems to me that Intuit is pushing too aggressively to force users to spend more money on their products - wanting to make more money is ok; it's what drives our system, but Intuit has developed a pattern of being sneaky and devious in their tactics.  I would not be so upset with them if they were charging more and delivering more, but they seem to be sneaking up on users, e.g., TurboTax 2014 doesn't really tell you what you are missing in 2014 (that was included in 2013 and previous years), until you are at a point in the preparation of your return where it is tempting to submit, pay the extra $40 and move on.

Customer service:  I made an error found at the end through the error checker.  I called H&R.  Their rep had me upload my file to her on a secure server so she could see what I was seeing.  She went through several things but did not find the solution.  She wanted to go back to the beginning.  In a moment of brain lapse, I had checked statutory employee (though the W2 13 block was empty).  I unchecked that and it solved the error.  She spent about 20 minutes with me, was very patient, spoke very clearly.

Audit Defense:  I paid  $30 (can't remember exact amount) extra for audit defense with Turbo Tax.  With H&R, audit defense is FREE.

So, the software functioned well: 1). imported last years TurboTax data; 2). imported Etrade, Schwab, and Fidelity transaction info completely and without errors; 3). WI and MI state filings completed without problems. 4). E-filed federa without problems; 5). printing and archiving worked fine.

I am a long-time TurboTax user who switched to HRB this year.  So far, the aforementioned programs are substantially equivalent in their functionality.

But, anyone who is trying to populate their Schedule D by importing transaction information from Etrade will likely be peeved.

Importing data from Fidelity and Schwab worked perfectly, that is, complete and with no errors.

However, I tried dozens of times to import tax data from Etrade using the HRB software. Up until 2-19-15, the HRB software returned the following error message: ""Your import was unsuccessful. Try again later or enter your tax information manually from your paper documents. Error code: 2000"".

Of course, anyone with even a modest number of trades knows that entering such information by hand is not a solution.  The error code means, according to the HRB technical help team, that login credentials could not be verified.  HRB indicated that it is a known problem and that they are working on it.

On 2-20-15, I received a message from Etrade confirming that import failure is a known issue, and that they ""...received word from H&R Block that their software issue will be fixed no later than February 23rd.""

Today's error message from HRB shifts the blame to Etrade: ""Your financial institution doesn't have your form ready to import yet. You can enter information from your paper form now or wait until your import is ready (on Tuesday, February 24, 2015).""

I installed the software on a desktop with Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit version. The process went without a hitch. The software imports the 2013 Turbo Tax file without any problem on the first try. I start the Fed 1040 form and import my W-2 online, again, not a hitch. From there, I continue for about half hour, and I finished the 1040 with refund similar to last year that I got with Turbo Tax.
I got the job done as expected ... for half the price of Turbo Tax. So from now on, H&R Block will have me as a new customer.
No more last minute extortion for upgrading ...

I also have a wish list:
- The text on the interface is little too small to read (font size 8?)
- Print the completed return + the worksheet to keep for record (in PDF) could combine into one file included Fed and State forms.

I read some of the reviews to see what was going on. Apparently Turbo Tax kept the same ""Deluxe"" name as in the past but they removed a bunch of features that people were using, various schedules for self-employment, investments, etc. And the price was kept the same.  What a fraud!
So I bought the H&R Block ""Deluxe"" which was actually cheaper and it includes all the stuff that is now missing from TT.

From what I have read about Intuit's Turbo tax for 2014 I am glad I stayed with Block.
I have  investments, deductions, and other tax forms I use in the Deluxe version.

Block's 2014 Deluxe installed with out an issue and updated 2x so far. After the 2/4 update I will actually start the taxes.
That is if all forms are up to date. Block 2014 will not let you e-file/finish if something is not up to date.
The key to successfully using this program each time is:
#1. Take your time and have the program transfer your data from last year. Does save a lot of time. Just make sure its up to date.
#2. Most important take your time and carefully read each question and answer it. If you rush and miss one it will land up possibly skipping something further into the program that you need. You can always go back and fix it.

With Turbo Tax I could not e-file my state taxes because it didn't send my federal schedule A with my state tax returns (schedule A was always more than state standard deduction).",H & R Block a lot less than Turbo Tax Premier

After you finished tax return you can send electronically your Federal Return (no paper filing).

I shifted over to HRBlock (used to be Taxcut) after reading many Turbtax reviews that you can no longer use TT Deluxe for Sched D efiling for the 2014 version. TT requires you to buy TT Premier at a cost that is 2x that of HRBlock Deluxe.  I found HRBlock excellent and installed on my Mac quickly without problems.  It imported last year Turbotax files as well as Quicken for Mac 2015 files without error. I found HR Block easier to use and the import was more complete than Turbtax (TT) deluxe.  I am very happy with the shift to HRBlock. All of my fears of shifting tax software were unfounded. TT has gotten greedy and others should consider letting the market send a loud no buy message to Intuit (TT parent).  After using HRBlock I probably would not shift back to TT even if they dropped their price and made thier Deluxe version with the same features as their 2013 product.  I have found HRBlock to be an excellent product and accurate. I obviously have not yet tested the efiling portion of the program but I am assuming no glitches.

First, the cost was half of what TurboTax Deluxe costs this year.  Second, the H&R Block product is complete with all the forms and support you expect from the middle-of-the-road version of a tax preparation program.  I need more than the basics, but not the business-class product.  This product covers my needs, whereas the TurboTax Deluxe product doesn't.

I was able to install the H&R Block software with no problems on my laptop running Windows 7.  After entering the activation code, the program found my 2013 TurboTax return and with one click, imported all of my data without any problems.  So far, I've only gone through the personal information section, but I can say it is every bit as simple as TurboTax.

Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both H&R Block and TurboTax to compare. I found that both programs satisfied my needs but H&R Block costs consistently less.  I have been buying the Deluxe version of H&R Block, before purchasing I check to see if my needs are covered by the feature set of Deluxe version. The main thing I check if the mutual funds sales and cost basis calculations are included (Schedule D) and the form for Foreign Tax Credit from mutual funds is present (Form 1116). H&R Block Deluxe version includes these forms but to get this functionality in TurboTax you need to buy the Premium version of the software.

 INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 I had no problems with my install. However last year I helped a friend resolve an install problem on a Windows 8 PC.  I am including what we did in case this helps someone else. Normally the automatic install runs a file called ""tcauto.exe"". This file in turn calls another program located under ""installers"" directory which actually does the work.  We were able to by-pass the error by executing the exe program in the installers directory directly ""HRBlock_Deluxe+Efile+State_2014_CD.exe"" (it is the only file in that directory).

 If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

 If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you dowload it. The key-code can be located two ways.
Option 1: After my download finished the install started automatically offering me a choice of two links ""View Keys"" and ""Install"".
Option 2: You can locate it in your Amazon account:
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

 Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs?
I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic ""Installing Software on Another Computer""
I quote the FAQ answer below:
""There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.
Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer.
Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.
The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, ""Can I install the software on a second computer?""
Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate.
You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.""

 WHAT IS INCLUDED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I purchased H&R Block Deluxe plus State. This version entitles me to 5 free federal e-files. It allows me to print and mail as many returns as I want without any extra fees, there is no limit on printing or mailing returns using the Post Office.

One state software is included in the package but the package does NOT include free e-file for the state return (see one exception below). If you want to e-file your state return you will need to pay a fee of $19.95 to e-file each state return. Alternatively, you can print all the forms and mail them using US post office without any additional fees. If you need to file taxes for an additional state, each additional state is $39.95 plus $19.95 e-file fee.

Note: NY state residents can e-file state returns for free.

 GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until mid January of 2015.

 Pet Peeve: H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version. That would have been useful.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations. Last year I had to do both and I found the guidance in Deluxe package was sufficient to complete the forms.

 Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on ""learn more"" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.

 H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

 DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC. You no longer need to enter this information on H&R web site. I prefer having this information locally on my PC for better security.  It suggests reasonable prices based on condition of the donated item and it is nice not to have to come with what is reasonable on my own.

 Pet Peeve: I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

 I usually purchase tax software as early as possible to help me with end year tax planning. However, if timing is not important to you be aware that the price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter ""Amazon price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word camel in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached. During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $44.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.

 Update: State returns are now available.
Original comment: For folks trying to download State Forms. The state forms are not available as of 11/30/2014. You have an option of entering email where you will be notified as soon as the form for your state becomes available. Alternatively, you can go to H&R website, hover (do not click) ""Download Software"" on the top banner and select ""State Editions"". Currently it says ""Please check back in mid January 2015"".

When the state forms became available and I clicked to start the download the entire program disappears for about a minute (I thought it crashed), but then the download screen appeared and the program continued normally.

 At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

 Sometimes I want to return to some section of my return.  The best way to jump to any section directly without navigating through other pages is to use ""take me to"" button which is displayed at the top of every page, on the same line as H&R Block banner.

 Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?
Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.

 Problem alert 
There is a bug importing TT 2013 data when using XP.  There is a lengthy discussion on this topic in H&R support forum including a post from H&R Support that they are aware of the issue and working on it.
Amazon does not allow to post URL links in the text of the review, so I am posting a link to the discussion as a comment. Hopefully there will be an update when the problem is fixed.

 The final tax return can be saved in a .PDF format for future reference.

Someone asked me about this rather late update and I was able to find what portion of the return is effected by the update by searching the H&R support forum: This update is related to ""The Health Insurance Coverage"" with ""The Marketplace Health Insurance"" for participants that are 65 or older.

 What to do if my social security number was used by a thief?

During the last year there were many different data breaches and some people's social security numbers have been stolen.  It appears that some thieves filed returns using the stolen social security numbers.  If this happens the person who tries to file a return will get the following error:

IRS records show the spouse's Social Security number (SSN) on this return is the same as the primary taxpayer's SSN on another return already filed this year. Double-check your spouse's SSN. Fix any issues and e-file again. Otherwise, you'll have to file a paper return.

What to do if this happens?
1. Call HRB told them of the issue (1-800-472-5625)
2. Call IRS (1-800-829-1040) had them flag the SS#
IRS states that people need to mail completed return, a copy of police report or Form 14039 Identity Theft Affidavit http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f14039.pdf, copy of Drivers License or passport or SS card.

3. Call Equifax and have them put an alert on the SS# (They notify Experian and TransUnion as well)
4. Call Social Security Administration and notify them (1-800-772-1213)
5. File with FTC https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/Information#crnt&panel1-1
6. File a police report of a possible identity theft


I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. I keep coming back because it works well for the tax forms I need to do and it is less expensive than TurboTax. If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.

After reading the bad reviews about TurboTax, I was worried that Block might have stripped some of the tax forms from the Basic edition to force me to buy the more expensive editions. Not so, the Basic edition is still the same as 2013 and all the previous years that I can recall, even going back to when it was called TaxCut.  I have never had any problems using the software.  It has all the forms necessary for filing.  Are you an investor?  Schedule D is included.  Are you a business man? Business forms are included.  Are you a farmer? Schedule F is included. From the Amazon product description: Everything you need to prepare your federal taxes in one complete program.

Over the years, TT has become very cumbersome to use, essentially forcing you to type in every piece of information on each and every 1099, assuming you are not smart enough to properly type in just the numbers you need.

Even at $15 this is a great program for doing your own taxes.  I have used Turbo tax since it was on 3.5"" floppy disks.  This year, TT (turbo Tax) lowered their price, but severely crippled their software in some bazaar marketing move that forces most users to have to go to the deluxe or premium to get the same functionality as the basic gave last year. (look up the current TT on amazon and read away!)

I wish I had made the move sooner!  Not only is the interface of H&R block very easy to follow (I can't say its better than TT because I didn't get it this year) its a snap to navigate and get thru the questions. I was able to complete my federal return in about 20 minutes.  I have a standard 1040 return with interest and mortgage info as well as one dependent.  I also did my wife's in about the same time. (with a second home and same basic interest and mortgage statements.)

The questions are laid out very smartly and you can see several questions at once and skip them if not needed.  I recall TT always forcing in the guided mode to go page by page thru dozens of irrelevant questions.

The only issue I had was with the PDF printing of my tax documents. For some reason it would fail unless I selected to change the PDF print properties first.  I have the full version of the current ADOBE Acrobat standard on my PC, so this may have been part of the issue as it may have conflicted with the software this program asked to install.  Regardless, after I figured it out, it was no problem.

On a side note, last years TT PDF's are more flashy and pretty than the basic looking ones this prints, but who cares.  The result is money in my bank account and quickly.  I had confirmation of the IRS accepting my return and my wife's within 30 minutes!",Good bye TurboTax!

67425,5,H&R Block,69.99,"04 15, 2015","I have used TurboTax for many years and, like many others, was very upset when they insulted our intelligence by splitting up their products this year with the obvious goal of forcing the customer into a more costly product.  I administer two trusts and have had difficulty finding a product that allows me to do my own returns and in prior years I have had to use very expensive tax preparers. It was with some pleasure that I found a basic program with H&R Block that did handle the filing of a trust return. More power to you H&R Block. The software was reasonably easy to use once I got through the basic learning curve and the only real problem I had is that I could never figure out how to use the program to efile. I understood the ads to say that this was possible, but I never found the correct path and just ended up printing out the return and mailing it in. When I do next year's return I will take the time of addressing the efile question, but this year I was so fed up with tax returns that I just took the path of least resistance and used snail mail. I definitely recommend using H&R Block over TurboTax software as the Block software is way, way cheaper and covers more issues. As a final item, I see in the H&R Block program they say they will provide representation at no cost if you are audited, whereas TurboTax charges a very healthy fee if one wants that protection.",Better than TurbTax

67474,5,H&R Block,69.99,"01 1, 2015","For over 15 years I have been using Turbo Tax for my personal returns.  For over 12 years I have been using Turbo Tax Business for my S Corporation.  This year I tried going on line to purchase my sofware at the Intuit site.  It would allow me to purchase the Deluxe but would not allow me to purchase my business software at the same time.  It kept trying to get me to sign up for another expensive year for their software.  So, I moved to Amazon added the two software products to my cart.  I was surpirsed to find a couple of reviews on software that most folks do not open until the new year.  One reviewer is similar to me.  He files a 1040 and a corporate return.  His comment is, why waste your money??

I ordered and received this week my H&R Block Premium & Business software.  I use Windows so can not comment on the frequent comments that in spite of the advertising, this product does not work on Apple.  This morning I loaded the software, super easy, and then did my W-2s for my business making sure they tied to my 941s and my annual state forms.  So far it is great.  I am still learning the 'how to navigate' but very clear and clean at 25% of the normal cost of Turbo Tax.  And when I am done, the cost of the software includes electronic filing for my State, Federal, and Federal business return.  Turbo Tax always charged me for my State return and my Federal Business Return.

So I ask you, the reader, do you enjoy taking money and pitching it up a hog's behind and hollering WEEEEEEEEEE PIG SUIIIIIIIIIIIIII, or would you like to put the money in your pocket and use the savings to take your closest friend to dinner??  It is time to dump Turbo Tax.  There are other alternatives!!!!!!!!!!  Now, it will take Amazon a couple of days to confirm I am in fact a certified buyer of the product and post that info so that all readers know I am for real!!!!!!!  Posted 1/1/15

Updated on February 7, 2015.  I have now completed both my 1120S for my S Corp and the 1040 for our personal.  My biggest problem was my initial unwillingness to follow the directions.  I tried to short cut the software.  IF YOU SIMPLY INSTALL THE SOFTWARE AND THEN ANSWER THE QUESTIONS IT ASKS, YOU WILL FIND YOUR RETURN IS QUICKLY DONE AND YOU WILL HAVE SAVED A BOAT LOAD OF MONEY.  I will never go back to Turbo Tax.  The next comment is conjecture, but I believe it is accurate.  Intuit writes lots of software.  They have to support all of those editions of software and if you have ever called Intuit support, you know you get some folks in India.  They are nice enough, but know nothing about US Taxes.  Intuit realizes that supporting all of the software is quite expensive.  So they will do away all the different versions of software and the related support and instead provide you the user with 'on line' products.  Costs may go down, but your most personal information will now be on a hard drive somewhere, some place that you have zero control over.  Likely on a cloud!!!!!!!!  And if you think Sony getting hacked was big news on the 5PM shows, as they say, you ain't seen nothing yet when the hackers get into the Intuit data base and your personal information and identity is being sold on line!!!!

67484,5,H&R Block,54.99,"12 28, 2014","I've been using H&R Block tax preparation software for 9 or 10 years now (it used to be called TaxCut).  For about 10 years prior, I used TurboTax, but found that H&R Block is typically $5-$15 less expensive for similar levels of the program.  I use a Mac, and this is my second year ordering the ""frustration-free package"" version because there is less packaging involved as well as a $5-$7 savings over the pretty-package version.

The reason I use tax software is for the convenience.  TaxCut generates all forms and performs all needed calculations as you input your financial information.  This year, the interface is organized differently, with the ""play-by-play"" snapshot of your refund (or tax liability) over in a left window pane instead of being listed across the top.  Otherwise, the functionality is very similar to previous years.  You proceed through your return via an ""interview"" format, and the program creates and completes forms as needed based on your responses to its questions.  As in previous years, you can e-file up to 5 federal returns with this program, so if you are married filing separately (or not married and filing separately) or you have a child or other dependent that needs to file his/her own return, you only have to purchase the program one time.

Other conveniences:  the program can input several pieces of information from previous TaxCut returns (name, address, spouse & dependent information, income sources, deductions) and it gives you the option of automatic updates whenever you open it.  The program also asks you about present and possible future changes in your life situation, so that you can potentially predict your 2015 tax situation and make adjustments (NOTE: using this program is NO guarantee that our democratically elected government won't change things!).  I saw another reviewer comment that state tax preparation was not included.  I purchased the ""Premium"" version that includes preparation for state taxes as well, so be sure to get the version with the functionality you need.

Nothing beats being organized, and since our tax situation hasn't changed that much in the last several years, I know what documents to have on hand, and I was able to complete our return in less than an hour.  Without TaxCut, it may have taken days!  It's early in the game, but I haven't experienced any crashes or issues.  If I do, I'll update my review.

UPDATE:  I just finalized our tax return (had to find the last of those receipts!), and there were no crashes or issues of any kind.  I should also add that the program gives you the option of creating a complete backup of your return, which includes the program itself, in case you need to come back to it at a later time--another very nice feature.  I will be putting mine on a disk and keeping it in my fireproof safe...just in case.","GREAT FOR TAX PREPARATION, AND EVEN (SIMPLE) FINANCIAL PLANNING"

67529,5,H&R Block,54.99,"05 25, 2015","I do my own tax return, mainly because I have complex tax situations...more than 5 schedule K-1 from various LLC investments (including 2 oil drilling investments with complex tax codes), more than 10 rental properties, more than 5 stock trading accounts...etc. First of all, not all the tax-filer have the related experience or knowledge to handle my tax return. Or it will cost me a fortune for an experienced CPA to do my tax return.

I was using Turbo tax initially, but I didn't find special advantage in Turbo Tax when comparing with H&R's Tax Cut. So, I switched over to Tax Cut, and I have been using H&R tax cut for the past 8 years. It's not only cheaper, but also capable of handling my tax return's needs. It has an easy interview process to guide people to enter information. It also allow me to fetch specific form to allow manual modifications. I can also do quite some if-else analysis to assess different tax strategies with it. Also, the cost of purchasing additional state tax packages is low (I have rental properties in various states that require me to file multiple state tax returns.).

To my experience, both Turbo Tax and Tax Cut are not much difference in functions and capabilities. But I would recommend Tax Cut for its value.","Same function like Turbo Tax, but with a more reasonable price."

67593,5,H&R Block,54.99,"03 22, 2015","Up until this year I've never used tax software, and rarely had to do my own taxes at any point in my life (once or twice with a 1040 EZ as I remember was about it.)  This year my husband reluctantly agreed to let me give it whirl after he missed a few things on our return last year, and we ended up having to pay more taxes and complete an amended return.

When I went looking at the various tax software programs and read the reviews, I decided H&R was the one for me. Married, filing jointly with some self-employment and retirement income and filing for only one state residency, ""Premium"" was what we needed to get things done.

-------------------------------

The interview questions help you through most of it, but I did get stumped a few times. Reading the help section got me through, however I did find I needed to re-do at least half a dozen things before all was said and done. This could have just been my inexperience with the whole process or not accurately interpreting the 'help' info provided.

Having everything in front of me and entering data as I went along was easy. Once the federal return is complete, the State return kind of does itself. I got a little nervous a few times thinking I'd sent in my return, but thankfully there are several checks and balances in place that won't allow that to happen.

While this wasn't what I'd call 'simple', it was easier than sitting down with sheets of paper and a booklet, trying to make sense of it all. Calculations are automatically done for you, and deductions are maximized. Questions are generally very clear and explanations as to the nuances of what things are 'covered' are concise and in layman's terms.

This software definitely helped me to maximize our deductions, and gain insight into what I can do this year to help us for next years taxes. It made seeing the bigger picture easier than it had been in the past for my husband too.

-----------------------------

The best thing about this software is the quantity and quality of information I received from doing our taxes this way. It made me think about next year, and relieved that it's likely to be a much easier process with this e-file done and in the system.

I liked that H&R's software provided us with glitch-free filing. A print and mail-in option was available (a way to save the twenty bucks on your state filing with a longer wait for a refund) , but since I heard that both my federal and state returns were accepted within 1 hour of submitting them via e-file, the twenty bucks spent on the state return was well worth it for both a quick refund and peace of mind.

I will definitely use this software next year, and recommend it to others.

-----------------------------------

UPDATE 4/8/15:

Received confirmation of acceptance of both State and Federal returns within 5 hours of filing them. Federal tax payment was taken out of my account within 8 hours of that confirmation, and we received a deposit of our refund from the State within 7 days.

I feel like this was a much more comprehensive way to to our taxes than the old paper version, and I'm relieved that next year we'll be all set to do it again using H&R!","Fast filing, acceptance and deposit of refund - UPDATE 4/8/15"

I have a rental and now it's easier to claim car mileage and claim car depreciation when I use my vehicle for rental business. I usually gave up and let that part go rather than pay a tax pro $ 300.00. Turbo tax was complicated and weird in this respect. Only a tax pro would understand that part. I'm no tax expert. In fact I'm a down right dummy when it comes to taxes. This years program made it easier to do my taxes. A couple of suggestions though. First make it plain at the beginning  on how to begin entering data manually. At first the program wanted to pull the data from my computer or a financial program like Intuit.

But this year, Intuit decided to become deceptive and tricky with their pricing structure, in effect, raising their prices for the average home user and home business user by probably 25% to 30%.  I didn't calculate the exact difference, but it was absurd.  They say their structure makes it simpler for the user to decide which version to use.  Bull pucky.  It's all about the money.  Bad decision on their part.  As you do a little research on the subject matter, you will see that there has been a mass exodus from TurboTax to H&R Block software.  As well as to other brands.  This version of H&R Block that I got was just as easy to use as TT, and a lot cheaper.  I would probably go back to TT in the future if they come to their senses, but it's only because I have used their software so long that it has become a standard.

I will say at the outset my only issue so far with H & R is the importing of prior information from TT.  I could not get it to function, and gave up trying to contact HR's support.  But for me it wasn't that big a deal but may be for others.  Did not take much time to enter my info anew.  The H & R software loads almost immediately vs my experience with TT taking awhile.  Beyond that minor issue, H & R was for me much more efficient to enter information.  Rather than having to wade through multiple pages of questions in TT, HR gives you a laundry list on a page, and you check what applies and then proceed accordingly.  HR also generates separate files for returns to be filed vs. worksheets, whereas TT mixed them all together which I considered a real pain, as I still prefer to file by mail, an affinity shown to have merit given the recent issue of TT users apparently having their online filing info hacked.",Glad I switched to H & R from Turbo Tax.

It's simple to use, guiding your through entering your data (or importing it from online, if your bank/employer support that option) and showing you what your entries do to your tax refund/liability.

There are a few things to note here:
1.) Make sure you buy the appropriate level of the software (Deluxe, Premium, etc) for your tax needs. Check the H&R Block software site to determine which version you need.

2.) While it notes that this is Federal and State software, you get 5 free FEDERAL e-files with your purchase.  To e-file with a state costs ~$20, though you can print and file the forms freely if you wish.

3.) While this is the disk version of the software, I recommend it only to those that have an internet connection - on install, it requires updates to get the most up to date tax codes and forms.  Also, any state programs have to be downloaded (from within the application) as these are not on the disk.

All in all, a great alternative to TurboTax at generally a better price point.  And it can even import previous year's returns from rivaling software!","Better Than Alternatives, Easy To Use - Takes the Pain out of Tax Time."

After installing and getting past the importation of 2013 from Turbotax I can report that everything went real smoothly. In addition I like so far what I see in terms of the user interface.

Although I had to print out and mail the local tax form, I did not even know that it was included in the program.  Also, unlike TurboTax, it did not constantly try to trick an unsuspecting person into buying upgrades by making you uncheck boxes for things that you did not want.  Years ago, I changed from H&R Block to TurboTax because at that time Turbo Tax was more informative and easier to use.  But now because TurboTax tried to rip off its new and longtime users, it will be a long time before I will ever trust them again.

67657,5,H&R Block,54.99,"02 21, 2015","Once the Forms 1099 stop arriving, its time to start the tax filing process.  Our family has to prepare nine returns for filing,  including federal, state, local, Philadelphia etc.  It takes two sittings, maybe 5-6 hours.  Since the dawn of the computer age,  I have used  Turbotax  Deluxe;  I am self-employed, but other family members are W-2 wage-earners etc.  Occasionally we had a tax issue that was complicated, but Turbotax Deluxe was always good enough.  Until this year.

  This year I went to Amazon to purchase the Turbotax program, and learned that there is no provision for Schedule C in the deluxe program for 2014.  If one is self-employed, the federal tax return turns  largely on Schedule C  (at least mine does).  The Intuit product that does handle Schedule C  this year costs  much more,  and is loaded with features which we don't need.  So I started reading the reviews.

I was reluctant to try it, but I settled on the H.R. Block Premium program for less than $40.00.  The only people who like change are wet babies, and  I figured that  if  HRB was a bust, Id just eat the forty bucks and suck up the $ 90.00 for  Turbotax Platinum.*  Could not have been more wrong. This HRB program is a delight.  Once installed,  it imported my Turbotax  data from last year (95%  of it, anyway).  The questions were logical, straightforward, and navigation was simple and elegant, once I got the hang of it.  More,  HRB handled the pesky nuisance  local  township  return, which Turbotax ignores.  It gave advice during the process but was easy to override, and it was easy to go back to earlier forms etc.  At the end of the process the federal and state (PA)  returns were  printed, saved,  and e-filed  (PA State is free, as well as federal)  and confirmation received.  I am not done yet, and the  local returns still have to be filed, but all of  the heavy lifting is done.  Great product.

I still have to mail in the whopping checks to the IRS and Pennsylvania;  not HR Blocks fault.

However, I immediately noticed TT had a ""1-star"" rating this year, whereas it was always rated 5 stars in the past.  In reading the TT reviews, I realized TT was basically now selling last year's free (1040EZ and 1040A) software under the ""Basic"" name.  Anyone, like me, who bought the ""Basic"" version for the schedules (A, B, C, etc.) and forms was getting pushed to the Premier version selling for close to $50.  Just another corporate money grab. Yes, I read that TT tried to recant their bad decision by providing the schedules and forms...but guess what TT....too late.

I was initially apprehensive about having to learn a new (H&R Block) tax software program, but I found the H&R software easier to use than TT.
It is extremely easy to use, very accurate, and has all the schedules and forms I need.
Now that my taxes are complete, I have decided to stick with this H&R Block software until they (hopefully never) pull a TT scam.

Since they were changing around their features this year, I looked at reviews for H&R Block Software and discovered that the Basic edition would meet my needs at a much better price then TurboTax.

It pulled in my details from my 2013 TurboTax filing, which really sped things up and the process was mostly straightforward and fast. No problem including my student loan interest deduction. It was a little trickier to figure out the healthcare issues, since I'm part of a healthcare cost sharing group. Once I figured out where I was supposed to be putting the info in, it adjusted accordingly and auto-completed most of the additional form for me.

(Deluxe and Basic TT no longer support Schedules C & D, for instance, requiring an upgrade to Premier.)  I had been a satisfied TurboTax user since 1994.  I wasn't looking to make a change but Intuit essentially pushed away.

After considerable research, I decided to try the download version of H&R Block Tax Software, and I'm quite happy so far.  The program seamlessly imported data from last year's Turbo Tax file.  (I went through the preliminary interview process, and all the information appears to transfer correctly.)  Due to the perennial last-minute IRS changes, the actual forms are not yet available and obviously I can't import 1099 or W-2 information yet.  Nevertheless, the H&R Block software appears to do everything that TurboTax did for less than half the price ($29.99 on discount vs. $69.99 on discount for TT Premier).

After being a Turbo Tax user for more than 10 years, I too became very disappointed with the stunt that Intuit pulled on us with the Turbo Tax 2014 Deluxe now stripped of features and much needed forms.  So I switched to H&R Block Deluxe.  The digital download worked perfectly.  Installation on Windows 7 went flawlessly.

When I ran the software for the first time, it could not find my TTax file for importation.  Not to worry.  I closed the program and launched it again.  This time, it found my TTAX file and imported all the data with no problems whatsoever.

For all intents and purposes, the interview process for income, deductions, etc. is the same as that of the ""other software.""  Imported my new W2 information also flawlessly.  Entering my income information, deductions, investment transactions, etc. went flawlessly.  This software also checked my tax forms for errors, and I was able to generate PDF files and file electronically without a glitch.

Somebody mentioned that the screen interface is not as good as that of TTAX.  Well, perhaps.  Who cares, really!!?  H&R Deluxe has a very good graphics interface and interview process.  Bottom line:  I should have switched a long time ago.  Excellent software, highly recommended.

I have been buying the Deluxe version of H&R Block, before purchasing I check to see if my needs are covered by the feature set of Deluxe version. The main thing I check if the mutual funds sales and cost basis calculations are included (Schedule D) and the form for Foreign Tax Credit from mutual funds is present (Form 1116). H&R Block Deluxe version includes these forms but to get this functionality in TurboTax you need to buy the Premium version of the software.

 INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 I had no problems with my install. However last year I helped a friend resolve an install problem on a Windows 8 PC. I am including what we did in case this helps someone else. Normally the automatic install runs a file called ""tcauto.exe"". This file in turn calls another program located under ""installers"" directory which actually does the work. We were able to by-pass the error my executing the exe program in the installers directory directly ""HRBlock_Deluxe+Efile+State_2014_CD.exe"" (it is the only file in that directory).

 If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

 If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you dowload it. The key-code can be located two ways.
Option 1: After my download finished the install started automatically offering me a choice of two links ""View Keys"" and ""Install"".
Option 2: You can locate it in your Amazon account:
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

 Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs?
I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic ""Installing Software on Another Computer""
I quote the FAQ answer below:
""There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.
Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer.
Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.
The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, ""Can I install the software on a second computer?""
Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate.
You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.""

 WHAT IS INCLUDED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This H&R Block Deluxe includes only the federal tax return (no State).  This version entitles a person to 5 free federal e-files.  The program allows to print any number of returns without limits, and if you decide to mail returns (instead of e-filing) there no additional fees.

 GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until mid January of 2015.

 Pet Peeve: H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version. That would have been useful.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations. Last year I had to do both and I found the guidance in Deluxe package was sufficient to complete the forms.

 Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on ""learn more"" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.

 H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

 DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC. You no longer need to enter this information on H&R web site. I prefer having this information locally on my PC for better security. It suggests reasonable prices based on condition of the donated item and it is nice not to have to come with what is reasonable on my own.

 Pet Peeve: I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

 I usually purchase tax software as early as possible to help me with end year tax planning. However, if timing is not important to you be aware that the price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter ""Amazon price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word camel in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached. During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $44.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.

 At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

 Sometimes I want to return to some section of my return. The best way to jump to any section directly without navigating through other pages is to use ""take me to"" button which is displayed at the top of every page, on the same line as H&R Block banner.

 Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?
Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.

 Problem alert 
There is a bug importing TT 2013 data when using XP.  There is a lengthy discussion on this topic in H&R support forum including a post from H&R Support that they aware of the issue and working on it.
Amazon does not allow to post URL links in the text of the review, so I am posting a link to the discussion as a comment.

 Adding this point based on a useful question in the comments:  The final tax return can be saved in a .PDF format for future reference.

 Updated 2/25/15. You might have noticed that front page states that the next update is March 12, 2015. Someone asked me about this rather late update and I was able to find what portion of the return is effected by the update by searching the H&R support forum: This update is related to ""The Health Insurance Coverage"" with ""The Marketplace Health Insurance"" for participants that are 65 or older.

 What to do if my social security number was used by a thief?

During the last year there were many different data breaches and some people's social security numbers have been stolen.  It appears that some thieves filed returns using the stolen social security numbers.  If this happens the person who tries to file a return will get the following error:

IRS records show the spouse's Social Security number (SSN) on this return is the same as the primary taxpayer's SSN on another return already filed this year. Double-check your spouse's SSN. Fix any issues and e-file again. Otherwise, you'll have to file a paper return.

What to do if this happens?
1. Call HRB told them of the issue (1-800-472-5625)
2. Call IRS (1-800-829-1040) had them flag the SS#
IRS states that people need to mail completed return, a copy of police report or Form 14039 Identity Theft Affidavit http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f14039.pdf, copy of Drivers License or passport or SS card.

3. Call Equifax and have them put an alert on the SS# (They notify Experian and TransUnion as well)
4. Call Social Security Administration and notify them (1-800-772-1213)
5. File with FTC https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/Information#crnt&panel1-1
6. File a police report of a possible identity theft


I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. I keep coming back because it works well for the tax forms I need to do and it is less expensive than TurboTax. If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.

This is preliminary, written before all of the IRS forms are ready.

Switched to H&R Block this year due to the TT bait and switch that effectively doubled the price of the version I need -- after 20+ years using TT.
DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL OF H&R BLOCK
Purchase and d/l was easy. A downloader app is installed first.
Upon d/l the installation file is then d/l to your desktop. Poor form to do that. Should allow placing it where you want.

You are presented with three buttons:
-- view d/l location (it's your desktop so don't bother)
-- keys (I clicked on this and made a record of the key
-- install

CLICKING INSTALL
I disabled my antivirus protection temporarily. Don't know if that's necessary. Often is.
The program defaults to installing under ""Programs"" but I put it under ""financial"" -- your choice.
The program installs as you would expect in any Windows program.
Choose the option to create a desktop icon. You will need it.
The installation does not automatically open the program. Use the DT icon.

SETUP
Start the program. You'll need that code from the email or from clicking KEYS at the outset.
Fill in your info and choose to activate the program. It's quick.
(optionally) Go to MyBlock, A screen presents to log in or create an account.
Update the program. I chose to have the program check for updates each time.

STARTING A RETURN
H&R immediately found where my prior TT return was located. Clicked import.
A folder ..\Documents\HRBlock was automatically created. I changed that to my financial folder.
The up-front interview forms are simpler than TT. Since the forms are not fully ready from the IRS at the time of this review I can't tell how the rest of the process will be.

Thus, I am able to obtain the selected licensed program, and the Amazon downloader functions correctly on OS X Snow Leopard.  Apple should learn from Amazon's great response how to create customer delight!

Original review (just for reference):

The latest downloader from Amazon will not launch under Snow Leopard, v10.6.8!  The help pages provided by Amazon lead to a dead-end.  Someone from Amazon needs to fix this situation immediately.  Thus, when you purchase the program, you cannot obtain it via the download.  It would certainly help if someone actually tested the software before deploying it.  Last year's downloader launches, but Amazon has changed the gateway, causing it to refer you to this year's version for 2013, which doesn't work either!

68022,5,H&R Block,34.6,"02 14, 2015","I've been using TurboTax since 1995 - yes, 1995.  Due to Intuit's increasingly asinine business practices - this year their product is quite simply deceptive - I decided to switch, and it was with no small amount of wariness I purchased this software instead.  No worries - everything worked like a charm.  It imported my information from last year's TurboTax file, looked up my W-2 information effortlessly (TurboTax was sometimes not successful with this, for whatever reason), and I was done with my taxes in under an hour (granted, I was prepared with all my paperwork ahead of time).  This package does include Schedule C, though I didn't use it this year and so didn't test it out, but it is included (this year, TurboTax apparently dumped all but a simplified version of Schedule C from their Deluxe software, which previously had always included the full deal).  Online filing is free, audit protection is free (TurboTax always charged $40 for third-party protection), and the whole process of filing my taxes for 2014 was about as effortless and painless as I could ask it to be.

A warning about all the one-star reviews on this site:  the majority of them are because the purchaser didn't realize they were buying the version that DOES NOT INCLUDE STATE.  So if you are looking for State, THIS IS NOT THE VERSION YOU WANT.  There is a similar version for about $10 more that does include state.  Both products are clearly labeled, so if you purchase this version on accident, that's on you and you shouldn't be leaving a one-star review for your mistake.  Not only is that unfair to H&R Block and Amazon, it's unfair to us potential customers.  Took me a while to peruse all the user reviews carefully to ascertain that the poor reviews were due to the purchaser's ineptitude, and not some fault or flaw in the software or the online delivery of the software.  These are supposed to be product reviews, not ""I regret my mistake so I'll blame the company"" editorials.

Product works 100% as advertised and did a great job for a fraction of the price of TurboTax.  Consider me a permanent switch from Intuit.",Great alternative to Intuit's declining tax software

H&R Deluxe does pretty much what I need TT Premier for at less than half the price.

While the software does not have the look and feel of TT, I don't care much for it since I don't plan to use this on a regular basis. Tax filing is a one time deal.
You can import from last years TT file, as well as Quicken for this years transactions.
Given that I had a few hundred, it did it quite accurately. Definitely useful to run a few scenarios before the tax year is over to simulate what-ifs and optimize the taxes for this year!

This software leads you through doing the tax return in an interview format, asking one question at a time in a way that has logical flow to it.  Sometimes it feels a little clunky to navigate around a tax return to make corrections after going through the interview on the first run.  But I really like the interview format that the software leads you through -- it makes doing taxes so much less overwhelming to only have one question to answer at a time.  Of course it makes comprehensive corrections with each edit of any particular number -- waaaay easier than filling the forms out by hand.

I also have a lot of confidence in following H & R Block's tax information -- they are such a huge player in the world of income taxes; if H & R Block says it, the IRS will surely agree.  I also really love the Deduction Pro software.  It is kind of a pain to use; but I appreciate valuing my charitable in-kind donations (like the kind going to the thrift store) using the software.

I don't think my taxes are all that difficult, but HR Block software just makes it so easy, and I'm typically done in a half hour or so.

Frankly, I went with HR Block simply for the cost (they typically offer 50% discounts february-ish?), and the download from Amazon makes things so simple.  It reads my previous year's save files and imports everything for me, and I can e-file and get direct deposits.

68218,5,H&R Block,27.9333333333333,"05 14, 2015","I am (was) a 15 year plus TurboTax user.  Last year (2013 tax year), I had some ridiculous ""do-loop"" in trying to file my second state return with TurboTax.  I spent 20+ hours, quite literally, on the phone with several inept (& occasionally rude) TT reps, none of whom could resolve my issue or explain the loop. Had to file manually, by snail-mail. Vowed to try something different for 2014.  TT's marketing wizardry this year reinforced that decision.  Found just the program with H&R Block.  What I liked:
 The reviews on H&RB software were excellent.
 H&RB was half the price of TT, for basically the same package.
 I've always liked TT's It's Deductible program for tracking property donations.  H&RB's version was as good, if not better (easy & fast to use).
 The H&RB software was not as glitzy as TT, but I felt like I had more control and a better understanding of my income & deduction entries with H&RB.  The program seemed more transparent and gave me more confidence in my finished returns.
 No unexplained do-loops.  File two states, Federal, and two kids returns with no problems whatsoever.  Seamless e-filing of all returns.
Overall, as pleasant an experience as filing income tax can possibly be - H&R Block's software took out most of the stress. I will most certainly be buying H&RB software for 2015's return.",H&R Block Tax Software is Excellent!

Having no base line to compare this software to I was pleasantly surprised at how detailed the process was as I went thru each phase step by step. I never had an issue that was not answered or explained with a few clicks.  The software allows for up to 5 free federal e-filings and charges an additional $19.95 if you wish to e-file your state return.  I opted to pay the extra cash for the convenience of the state e-filing and it seemed a small price based on the return I was scheduled to receive anyway.

I would highly recommend this product to friends and family, in fact I will offer to do my parents taxes next year using the newest version of this product.

When amazon.com offers this product for $25 or less, it's a no brainer and I don't see any reason why I will not be a long time customer of the H&R Block Tax Software Deluxe + State or it's future equivalent for years to come as long as the value and quality remain or exceed what I experienced with this version.","Easy to Use, Absolute Value"

68338,5,H&R Block,27.9333333333333,"04 15, 2015","I've been using TurboTax for the past 10+ years, but opted to go with H&R Block based on the NUMEROUS negative reviews that TurboTax received this year.  Not to mention, H&R Block was less than half the price!!  State is included with this software.  E-filing for State does cost $20, but they clearly disclose that before you purchase - and even with the $20, I'm still paying less than the BASE price for TurboTax (who, by the way, also charges for state e-filing - making it all the more expensive)!  If you want to avoid the $20 fee, simply snail mail your return instead.  There is no cost for federal e-filing.

I don't know why so many reviewers were having issues with obtaining the key code - as soon as I purchased the program, the key code was right there.  If you miss it the first time, you can obtain it by going to your Amazon software library.

Purchasing the online software was easy, and downloading only took about five minutes. I entered my key code and I was on my way.  The software is VERY user-friendly, and they were able to successfully import my 2013 tax info from TurboTax.  I was able to complete my taxes in about two hours, which is the same as when I used TurboTax.  Once completed, I received immediate confirmation of my returns being submitted (within the software and via e-mail), and within a couple of hours, I received confirmation that my returns were accepted by both the State and IRS.  Considering that I waited until April 14th to file, I think this is fast service.

I also like that you have the option for in-person support, which I didn't use, but I like that it's available if I need it.  I will be using H&R Block from now on!!!","Just as easy as TurboTax, but so much cheaper!!"

68340,5,H&R Block,27.9333333333333,"04 14, 2015","H&R Block Deluxe Software worked well for my federal and state returns.

I have used Turbotax Deluxe for years, and fortunately read the amazon Turbotax reviews before purchasing it again this year.  For reasons that can only be described as bone-headed, Turbotax decided to remove important schedules from their deluxe software this year.  I need to file schedule C, and would not have been able to use the deluxe software this year.  I think for schedule C, turbotax requires the $100 home and business version, but I am not really sure, and have no desire to waste time investigating further.  The whole turbotax debacle is a confusing mess.

The H&R Block Deluxe software was only $20, imported my old 2013 data from turbotax automatically, and was very easy to use.  If you have used turbotax in the past, there is very little difference.  And Schedule C and D are included (of course).

Hopefully I can come back to the H&R block software year after year, and just buy it without worry.  When I do my taxes, my goal is to get them done as fast as possible and with minimal stress.  I need software from a company I can trust, not one that clandestinely removes features and wastes my time.  Turbotax has destroyed that trust, hopefully H&R Block will earn it.",Another Turbotax refugee.

BTW, I think the Turbo Tax interface is mainly designed to be  MARKETING ploy. It's there to make feel like they're taking special care of you, being your good friend, and We got your back hombre.

I took H&R Block's preparation course several years ago, and have attended several tax law courses as well as IRS VITA/TCE training.

No double benefits such as allowing early childhood education credit on top of a child/dependent care credit for the same child to the same provider's EIN, which a top competitor's interface erroneously allowed.  In other words, download an IRS Pub 17 and buy this software if you want to prepare your own taxes without paying too much and still have confidence in an accurate return.

And they guarantee, if you answer all questions honestly, that you'll get your maximum refund. Youre asked questions all along the way, to make sure you don't accidently miss something, and get chances to back up and make changes if you need to. Theres double checks too, and a final accuracy check. I also like that they email you to confirm your tax forms have been sent, and email you again to confirm theyve been accepted (yes, sometimes e-filings can be rejected). If you're getting a refund you get to choose if you want it sent to you in a check, deposited electronically to one or more accounts (you can split it up), or sent to you in the form of a loaded debit card.

This software is for tax year 2014 (must be filed by April 15, 2015).

Keep in mind you only need to pay for this software if you're doing state taxes (for example, Washington state residents and employees do not file state taxes).

If you don't want to download the software to your computer you can go to H&R Block's website and fill out your tax documents there (and most people can also e-file) then pay when done. Basis federal filing is always free. Basic tax filing is $9.99 to $25 and up, depending on the type of returns you're filing and if you qualify for any promotions at the time.

Since Intuit really tried to take advantage of loyal customers, I switched to H&R Block this year. Furthermore, my brother-in-law used TT this year and had errors on his forms. Installation of the software from the Amazon download was straight forward and the updates were quick (Win 7).  H&R Block's navigation isn't quite as good (especially using the back buttons), the final printed forms aren't quite as polished, and the screen fonts are a little small. However, the software functions well and I trust the results. I will definitely be using H&R Block tax software next year.

Not only did TT try to rip off loyal customers, their pleas and offers to get us back were confusing and ultimately pathetic. I won't be going back to any Intuit product. Adios!",Adios TurboTax

And, I might say prepared a better return for 2014 than Turbo Tax did for 2013.

HR Block Deluxe was as easy to use as TT Deluxe, and the end result was the same refund.

Things I like better about HR Block over TT:
- TT had me fill in all possible deductions like Tax prep software costs and bank safe deposit box fees, only to ignore them because of minimums that were far greater.  HR Block lists the minimum cutoff %s and amounts at the top of the page with the deductions, so I didn't waste a bunch of time filling in the information that wouldn't be used.
- HR Block asked for mileage for each charitable donation drop off.  I did not see this in TT's ItsDeductible (if it's there, it's not obvious).
- HR Block's help menus are great, answering all but one of my questions in an easy to understand format.
- And of course HR Block didn't get greedy and play any games with pricing and features.  Yes, TT apologized and changed things back after a couple of months, but that was only because people flocked to HR Block and others.

Things I like better about TT over HR Block:
For entering many items, the ItsDeductible website is slightly easier and quicker to use than HR Block's equivalent.

Like many others, we were loyal TTAX users up to this year.  We had no problems loading HRB and uploading my 2013 TTX file.  I found HRB to be just as easy to use and like it very much and will probably continue as an HRB user in the future.  My only issue with it compared to TTAX was in the creation of a pdf copy of the files.  TTAX will create a pdf directly from within the program.  It is created with correct page separation and with bookmarks (on the left edge of the screen) that are very helpful in navigating thru a long document.  (I find pdf thumbnails to be virtually useless for this function.)  TTAX also allows you to create a pdf with only the pages needed for filing as well as a complete pdf for your files that includes any forms or worksheets you want to include.  You can omit those that aren't used for your filing.  On the other hand, HRB uses a third party program called pdfedit995.com which has to be downloaded to your computer before you can create any pdf from within the HRB software.  This program automatically creates two versions of your files.  One that has only the forms that are required for filing and a second one that has every other form or worksheet included in the software. This second pdf for us was 104 pages and includes many pages that have no entries on them and are not germane to my return.  Also, it does not create page bookmarks and some of the summary pages were not properly spaced so some information was cutoff at the bottom of the page.  The actual form and worksheet pages did seem to be created correctly.  Supposedly, you can use the pdfedit995 program to create bookmarks but it was very confusing software and I could not modify the created pdf's to include bookmarks.  In addition, although pdfedit995 is freeware, you have to put up with it creating several ad windows every time you open the program.  Or, you can purchase a $9.95 ""key"" to up grade it to eliminate the ads.  This was my only serious issue with using HRB software and is not a ""game changer"" by any means and will not discourage using HRB in the future.  Perhaps HRB will correct this for future versions.",I found HRB just as good as TTAX except for the creation of pdf files

He screwed up and I have to file an amended return.  I decided never again.  I started using Turbo Tax because that was what my brother uses for our family construction company and his taxes.  After the epic fail with the new release by Turbo Tax for 2014 I thought I'd give H&R Block a try.  My Turbo Tax return came over as did all our information.  The step by step process of filling out the tax return wasn't any easier than Turbo Tax, nor would I say it was harder; just different, especially after using Turbo Tax for 4 years.  But with the lower price for H&R Block I think I can learn to adjust.",Switched from Turbo Tax to H&R Block for our 2014 ...

Then when I searched on the forms I needed it seemed some changes had been made that were not going to be helpful to me.  I took a leap and went to HR Block and so far very glad I did.  First of all, I think the interface and the way they conduct their 'interview' seems more clear-cut to me than did TT.  Also it is easier to go back and forth between that process and looking at forms themselves (if you do that often).  Additionally, the best thing is this.  While the Deluxe didn't have a couple forms I needed, it was easy enough for me to look those up and figure out the additions myself without having to buy way more product than I needed.  The Deluxe had more than I expected.  I almost didn't even consider that level as I thought it would be too limited for our complicated taxes, but the comments lead me to review it and as I said, with a few extra 'outside' forms added, this version had everything I needed.  I hope I don't change my mind later one, but so far so good.  My only real complaint is the price for an additional state form EVEN WHEN NOT E-FILING.  I am a bit disappointed to have had to pay $39.95 for the extra state.  What happened to the claim on the TV ads earlier in the year that HRBlock was offering a fee of only $9.99 for the state?  I don't really expect an answer here but still think the almost $40 is too much.  Luckily not too many people need extra states.",I took a leap and went to HR Block and so far very glad I did

I used Deluxe because it was cheaper than Basic + State.  My only 'tricky bit' is Schedule C.  Not sure how Basic handles this, but it was easy with Deluxe and I felt confident (v. important) when it was finished.

I liked the wrap up, but the alerts could be more informative.  E-filing was easy (get your pin from the IRS website) and the option to print to PDF was good, though I'm not sure why it needs its own app.  I opted to e-file fed and mail state and that was actually given as an option, rather than a buried selection meant to drive state e-file sales.

I, admittedly, am a little compulsive about recording everything to support a figure that I enter into the tax form, and this software allows me to create mini lists to support a figure that I enter.

I was pleasantly surprised by the H&R Block software.  First of all, you can import last year's TurboTax file directly into H&R Block's program, and it copies in all of the information with no problem.  In general, I found the H&R Block software to be quite similar to TurboTax, but it is significantly cheaper.  I will definitely be using H&R Block in future years as long as it is cheaper than TurboTax.  They work about the same.

One thing to mention is if you want to eFile the state return, you need to pay $19.95 for that.  You can eFile a certain number of federal returns for free.  This is the same kind of thing that TurboTax does as well where they make you pay extra to eFile the state return (at least that is how it worked last year).

Bonus: it is much cheaper than the standard TurboTax software. Federal e-file and one state download included, extra 19.95 to e-file for state but that's pretty standard. I think an important thing to keep in mind when ordering tax software is to read the specifications on the product.

I've downloaded TaxACT and H&R Block and did taxes in all 3 programs this year: Turbo Tax, TaxACT, and H&R.

Turbo Tax backpedalled their underhanded ransom scheme and during my taxes I got upgraded to Premium then to Business - but I'm not trusting them anymore.

TaxACT - well, I wrote another review about that.

H&R Block Deluxe + State is clearly the best package out there - it is easy and comprehensive, and reasonably priced.

H&R effortlessly imported my data from the last year Turbo Tax file - so, no re-entry of my personal information needed. After verifying the info, I went on through the interview. The process is logical with a lot of help with easy access to the IRS form.

The interview in H&R pointed me to a deduction that Turbo Tax completely missed and it was a pretty nice ($$$) surprise.

I would highly recommend H&R to anyone: novice or experienced self-preparer and former Turbo Tax users will feel at ease using the new program.

With Turbo Tax pulling their ""Greed is Good"" ploy, by stripping out the guts of a product that they then sold to their loyal customers at the same or higher prices; I decided that they didn't appreciate my loyalty or continued use of their product.
I purchased H&R Block Deluxe and am very pleased with the seamless incorporation of my past Turbo Tax files into their platform. It was very pleasing to have the program run without a hitch. Also, it was half the price of the Turbo Tax program that I have previously used. So long INTUIT and your Turbo Tax disaster. My change of tax program was further appreciated when the latest news story of the Turbo Tax internet leak was plastered all over the news. I don't like to attract attention by voicing negative opinions concerning what people use or prefer. However, this vindictive move by Turbo Tax to destroy their goodwill with their loyal users has crossed the line of greedy self interest.
H&R Block will continue to keep my loyalty from now on.............OR, until they decide to shoot themselves in the foot and try to disrespect their customer base by bending them over and giving them a dry one, just as INTUIT and Turbo Tax has done.

Intuits greed and duplicity this year was a bridge too far, and Ill never go back.

H&R Block Deluxe installs faster (without ANY permanent updater/anti-piracy background services clogging up my PC forever like TT does), runs faster, has a cleaner, less cluttered interface, has less BS up-selling popups, and in general is less annoying than TT. BTW, H&R Deluxe imported my 2013 TT tax file flawlessly. (The quibble I have with H&R is that when you get to the point of filing and have a refund, they try to upsell you gift cards with the refund and hide the option to decline, requiring the use of the page's slider bar to find the decline option.)",I like H&R Deluxe better than TT Deluxe

The software imported all 4 of our previous Turbo Tax return data without any issues.  The navigation process is simple and seamless.  There was additional cost for the second state program and the efiles beyond the one included.  Total cost for the 4 Federal efiles, 4 State efiles (2 different states) was about what I would have paid for TurboTax software alone this year.",No Longer a Turbo Tax User!
68814,5,H&R Block,27.9333333333333,"02 5, 2015","There is a lot of confusion about fees for doing your personal tax returns using tax software.

The main distinction is that there is a difference between *preparing* a tax return and *e-filing* or *filing* a tax return.

The difference between *e-filing* a tax return and just *filing* a tax return using tax software like H&R Block or TurboTax etc. is that *e-filing* means the prepared tax return is submitted to the tax authority electronically. You can, if you wish, print the prepared tax return instead, put it in an envelope, and sent it to the tax authority by mail - this would be *filing* the tax return, as opposed to *e-filing*.

With the H&R Block Tax Software Deluxe + State 2014 software, you are paying for software which will enable you to *prepare* up to 5 Federal tax returns and and *prepare* up to 5 State tax returns for ONE State only.

When it comes to submitting the Federal tax returns, there is no e-filing fee - you can e-file up to 5 Federal tax returns electronically with this software, and there's no additional cost to do so. You can still print them out and mail them in if you wanted do, but I don't see why anyone would want to since e-filing the Federal tax returns is free, unless you have additional documentation the IRS require.

When it comes to submitting the State tax returns, you have two options:
(1) you can print out the prepared State tax return, put it in an envelope, and mail it to your State tax authority, and the only cost would be the stamp to send it, OR
(2) you can *e-file* the prepared State tax return via the software, and there will be an e-filing fee of $19.99 per State tax return to do so. This is not specific to H&R Block - you'll find TurboTax does it, as do all the others, to my knowledge. The one exception I am aware of is for New York State personal income tax filers - most New York State personal income tax filers can e-file for free, but that is mandated by New York State Law, meaning H&R Block, TurboTax etc. are not allowed to charge for e-filing in New York State. Let's hope other States start pushing similar legislation.

That's basically all there is to that.

Another point to note: if you need to file tax returns in more than one State, you will have to pay for additional software to *prepare* returns for those additional State(s) - I believe the cost is around $39.95 for each State, and that will allow up to 5 tax returns to be *prepared* (not e-filed) for each State purchased. You will also still be subject to another $19.99 e-filing fee for each additional State return filed as well (with the exception of New York). This is the same for TurboTax and all other retail tax software suppliers, to my knowledge.

There has also been comments about a $29.95 refund processing fee. I'll explain what I believe this fee is about. This fee is mostly mentioned with reference to TurboTax products, but I'll mention it here in case H&R Block have the same policy. When you have finished preparing your State tax return and elect to e-file it for the $19.99 fee mentioned above, you have an option to pay that $19.99 fee online by credit card right there and then, or have it deducted from your State tax refund. If you pay by credit card right there and then, there should not be any return processing fee. If you instead elect to pay that $19.99 fee by having it deducted from your State tax return, guess what - you're going to get hit with a $29.95 refund processing fee on top, just for the 'effort' of the company having to take their $19.99 out of it. That is what that fee is all about, I believe. Clearly it is better to pay the $19.99 by credit card right there and then, if you are able to.

Any H&R Block staff reading this please comment if I've said anything incorrect here and I will amend it accordingly.

On a personal note, I have used TurboTax Deluxe for years, and like many others, have switched to H&R Block Deluxe for my 2014 taxes because of TurboTax pulling what could be considered as a classic ""bait and switch"" by requiring an expensive upgrade to their Premier edition in order to get the same features that were previously always available in the Deluxe edition (for me, it was IRS Schedule D filing). Fortunately H&R Block have not made such a change. I filed my 2014 returns a couple of days ago using H&R Block Deluxe tax software and had zero issues importing my 2013 TurboTax file and completing my 2014 returns on H&R Block Deluxe. I appreciated the H&R Block charitable donation calculator, and use of the product was extremely intuitive. I have no intention of going back to TurboTax in future years.. particularly when TurboTax Premier was retailing at approximately 4 times what I paid for H&R Block Deluxe at the time I purchased it, for the same feature set!

This software is a little simpler to use than ""Brand T"".","Simpler to use than ""Brand T"" deluxe and lower price too."
68871,5,H&R Block,27.9333333333333,"01 25, 2015","I decided to bite the bullet this year and start doing my taxes myself instead of paying for someone else to do them for me. Once I made this decision I then had to decide which software to use for my purposes. For me, this meant either H&R Block Deluxe + State (which I ended up with) or Turbo Tax Premier. I had to bump up from the deluxe level if I were to use Turbo Tax since some of the items are no longer included in the Deluxe version of Turbo Tax that I need.

I just completed my Fiance's return (fed and state) using this software, and will be completing mine as soon as all of the papers come in. This was very easy to follow, all of the extra descriptions and info that you can click on are very well explained and clear to follow. The main reason I tried this software over Turbo Tax was that you get more for your money, including unlimited phone support and audit help should you get audited.

I have never used Turbo Tax though, so I am not sure how it compares from a useability standpoint, but I think these are both very comparable. This one was very easy to follow and I am very happy with the purchase. I am also sharing the software with some of my family members since it comes with 5 free efiles.

Update (2/4/15):
I have since filed my returns (fed and state), and following along with the software was very intuitive. My Fiance' just takes the standard deduction and has nothing to itemize so it is very straight forward. Mine on the other hand is more involved, since I itemize for various deductions (mortgage, student loan, donations, etc), and also have 1099-INT forms from interest bearing accounts. Following along with itemizing was just as easy as it was using for the standard deductions.",Great Value

It installed on my PC-Vista desktop in 3 minutes, then updated for another 3 minutes.  I was up and running in about 15 minutes.

Addendum, March 22, 2015:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I've just completed my taxes and I would like to share with you some of my experience using H&R S/W and my impressions on how the S/W compares with the formerly used TurboTax:
 1. Generally, I found the design of the menus and tabs very clear, concise, and easy to follow.  The layout design is less cluttered and less verbose than in TurboTax (TT).
 2. H&R is less supportive than TT in ""holding""  the users' hand and guide them to the correct answers.  H&R provides essential elements of each question, that are sometimes appear to be vague or cryptic to the uninitiated.  However, there are pop-up explanations of terms and further instructions from the IRS publications themselves, if the user requests them by clicking on links next to the question or term.
 3. One feature in the H&R S/W that I found annoying involved the sale transactions of stocks.  Although the data of sales of stocks transferred completely and correctly from the brokerage, one must ""review and validate"" every transaction, if there are any ""short"" sales.

I still think that the move from TurboTax was successful and I plan to use the H&R tax S/W in the future.",Easy and Cost-Effective Switch from Turbo Tax Deluxe

I was even able to download directly a complicated set of investments, including dividends, interest, and capital gains, from the investment firm, something I had not previously been able to do in TurboTax (for some reason).  Helpfully, the HRB software advised me to go through the downloaded material with my paper copy to make sure everything was correct--it was.

The kicker is that HRB sells for 30% less at retail than Intuit's crippleware.  While I won't be able to form a full opinion until I finalize, it appears that HRB wins stepping out of the gate.

Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both H&R Block and TurboTax to compare. I found that both programs satisfied my needs but H&R Block costs consistently less. I have been buying the Deluxe version of H&R Block, before purchasing I check to see if my needs are covered by the feature set of Deluxe version. The main thing I check if the mutual funds sales and cost basis calculations are included (Schedule D) and the form for Foreign Tax Credit from mutual funds is present (Form 1116). H&R Block Deluxe version includes these forms but to get this functionality in TurboTax you need to buy the Premium version of the software.

 INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 I had no problems with my install. However last year I helped a friend resolve an install problem on a Windows 8 PC. I am including what we did in case this helps someone else. Normally the automatic install runs a file called ""tcauto.exe"". This file in turn calls another program located under ""installers"" directory which actually does the work. We were able to by-pass the error by executing the exe program in the installers directory directly ""HRBlock_Deluxe+Efile+State_2014_CD.exe"" (it is the only file in that directory).

 If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

 If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you dowload it. The key-code can be located two ways.
Option 1: After my download finished the install started automatically offering me a choice of two links ""View Keys"" and ""Install"".
Option 2: You can locate it in your Amazon account:
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

 Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs?
I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic ""Installing Software on Another Computer""
I quote the FAQ answer below:
""There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.
Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer.
Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.
The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, ""Can I install the software on a second computer?""
Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate.
You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.""

 WHAT IS INCLUDED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I purchased H&R Block Deluxe plus State. This version entitles me to 5 free federal e-files. It allows me to print and mail as many returns as I want, there is no limit on printing.

One state software is included in the package but the package does NOT include free e-file for the state return (see one exception below). If you want to e-file your state return you will need to pay a fee of $19.95 to e-file each state return. Alternatively, you can print all the forms and mail them using US post office without any additional fees. If you need to file taxes for an additional state, each additional state is $39.95 plus $19.95 e-file fee.

Note: NY state residents can e-file state returns for free.

 GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until mid January of 2015.

 Pet Peeve: H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version. That would have been useful.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations. Last year I had to do both and I found the guidance in Deluxe package was sufficient to complete the forms.

 Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on ""learn more"" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.

 H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

 DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC. You no longer need to enter this information on H&R web site. I prefer having this information locally on my PC for better security. It suggests reasonable prices based on condition of the donated item and it is nice not to have to come up with what is reasonable on my own.

 Pet Peeve: I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

 I usually purchase tax software as early as possible to help me with end year tax planning. However, if timing is not important to you be aware that the price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter ""Amazon price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word camel in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached. During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $44.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.

 For folks trying to download State Forms. The state forms are not available as of 11/30/2014. You have an option of entering email where you will be notified as soon as the form for your state becomes available. Alternatively, you can go to H&R website, hover (do not click) ""Download Software"" on the top banner and select ""State Editions"". Currently it says ""Please check back in mid January 2015"".

When the state forms became available and I clicked to start the download the entire program disappears for about a minute (I thought it crashed), but then the download screen appeared and the program continued normally.

 At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

 Sometimes I want to return to some section of my return. The best way to jump to any section directly without navigating through other pages is to use ""take me to"" button which is displayed at the top of every page, on the same line as H&R Block banner.

 Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?
Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.

 Problem alert 
For those who are using Windows XP: There is a bug importing TT 2013 data when using XP.  There is a lengthy discussion on this topic in H&R support forum including a post from H&R Support that they aware of the issue and working on it. Amazon does not allow to post URL links in the text of the review, so I am posting a link to the discussion as a comment.

 The final tax return can be saved in a .PDF format for future reference.

 Updated 2/25/15. You might have noticed that front page states that the next update is March 12, 2015. Someone asked me about this rather late update and I was able to find what portion of the return is effected by the update by searching the H&R support forum: This update is related to ""The Health Insurance Coverage"" with ""The Marketplace Health Insurance"" for participants that are 65 or older.

 What to do if my social security number was used by a thief?

During the last year there were many different data breaches and some people's social security numbers have been stolen.  It appears that some thieves filed returns using the stolen social security numbers.  If this happens the person who tries to file a return will get the following error:

IRS records show the spouse's Social Security number (SSN) on this return is the same as the primary taxpayer's SSN on another return already filed this year. Double-check your spouse's SSN. Fix any issues and e-file again. Otherwise, you'll have to file a paper return.

What to do if this happens?
1. Call HRB told them of the issue (1-800-472-5625)
2. Call IRS (1-800-829-1040) had them flag the SS#
IRS states that people need to mail completed return, a copy of police report or Form 14039 Identity Theft Affidavit http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f14039.pdf, copy of Drivers License or passport or SS card.

3. Call Equifax and have them put an alert on the SS# (They notify Experian and TransUnion as well)
4. Call Social Security Administration and notify them (1-800-772-1213)
5. File with FTC https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/Information#crnt&panel1-1
6. File a police report of a possible identity theft

o  Finding out how to import from Turbo Tax was not challenging.
o  The import from Turbo Tax apparently went well.  (We'll see if carryover losses are carried forward and whether the program will be able to compare and contrast 2014's return with 2013's return for me).

I used to ""AUTO BUY"" their software but this year I noticed the price went up a bunch and they took away features. Why? I cancelled my ""Auto Buy"" from Turbo Tax and went to Amazon to look at reviews. Over 200 reviewers at 1 star, and a Turbo Tax VP replying to reviews. If I was that VP I would be re-thinking my position!! At-Any-Rate the reviews on the H&R Block Deluxe where very good and I decided to try the software this year. Its almost half the price of Turbo Tax with more features, (or what Turbo Tax took away).. Now I will have to actually do my taxes and post an update to this review but my preliminary review on the H&R Block software is great. Downloaded the software onto my MAC and installed it from Amazon in under 5 minutes, GREAT!!! Ran the H&R Block software, which looks for updates before it opens just like Turbo Tax does, and pulled in all of my personal data from Turbo Tax as advertised with absolutely no problems, and did it in what felt like seconds!

69053,5,H&R Block,34.6,"02 23, 2015","This is my first time using H&R Block tax software. I have used TurboTax for more than 10 years but after the recent issues with Intuits price hike, the change in what was included in their Deluxe version, and the recent security issues, I decided to go a different direction this year. While the two programs are very similar, I think H&R Block is my new favorite as it worked perfectly for me and the screens seemed a little less crowded and easier to navigate than the TurboTax software.

I bought the H&R Deluxe version (Mac Edition) which covers the same needs as the TurboTax version. I downloaded the digital version from Amazon and was working away in less than five minutes. I had no issues with the full program download or the most recent update and the program worked flawlessly.

Probably the most complicated entries I had (and that is stretching it) involved college student expenses reference my son. The software guided me through the forms I needed and when I compared it to last years TurboTax version they were identical in their directions and calculations (as they should be).

Again, I was reluctant to switch as I am always fearful of fixing what isn't broken but with the issues with TurboTax that I described above, as well as the fact that I bought the H&R software for nearly half the price that TurboTax wanted ($25 vs $49.00), I decided to give it a try and I am glad I did. I will return to H&R Block next year too unless pricing or other issues drive me back to TurboTax.

I have only gone so far to cover ""personal information"" in HRB, but the import looks good. I don't have all the 2014 tax info, so I can't give a full review yet.
HRB may not look as glitzy as TT, but we are talking about tax software. How much are you willing to pay for ""showtime""?

February 24th. Updated the software with the 2/17 release. No problems. Still haven't done 2014 taxes as Fidelity is delaying 2014 tax forms until mid March.

March 20th. Completed the first of two returns. Federal and NY State. NY state download went well.
Part of the return was completing IRS form 2555.... foreign income. Frankly, completing the form this year using HRB was just as frustrating as using TT last year. BUT not because of the software, but because of the IRS regulations.

Otherwise, all went well. HRB remains more graphically prettier and a bit more easier to navigate. But given the price difference for processing the same IRS regulations. HRB wins.

March 28th. Completed the second of two returns with 1099 INTs, Bs and Rs. Various itemized deductions.
Federal and NY and NJ State. No problem with state downloads.

Most recently as a user of Premier as I have rental and partnership income to address. As you may have read - they've changed their feature/pricing structure. They've gone to incremental feature pricing and the base pricing compared to their H&R Block is significant. So, I decided to take the plunge and try to change.

I purchased the download version of Premium from Amazon because the feature has saved my hide in the past. You never know when you will need to revisit your taxes years down the road and having the ability to go back to Amazon and re-download rather than searching for install media is priceless.

After downloading I imported last year's TurboTax return. It worked fine - no hiccups. All my tax, personal, employer, partnership (K-1), property and most importantly carry over passive losses transferred just fine. It's really early so I've just been adding some base information to my return for my rentals. The last couple of years TurboTax seemed to have gotten non-intuitive in many of their wizards. I've found I like the wizards with H&R Block. They're concise, clear and effective.

I'll update my review as I continue to work through my return over the next month. But, so far, no regrets in the changeover.

** Update 12Jan15
- Today I started the program and it downloaded and installed the first update since initial installation. With my 15Mb/s broadband and medium speed PC the entire process was about 2 minutes. Not bad.
- Since I got the update I tried to download both my employer payroll information (W2) and investment data (1099-B).
** First - I had to figure out how to do it. I clicked on Federal tab, then Income sub where it gave me a list of sections/tasks for my return. I started by hitting the 'Go To' under sales of Stocks, Bonds, etc. There I found two tasks, Add Asset and Import Assets. I guessed import where it tried to download a list of available financial institutions. Nothing yet - just a message indicating no institutions available - check back in mid-January.
** Second - back to the menu - click on Federal, Income, Wages Go To - there is a list of the imported (from last year) employer data. I click on Edit, Import - !! Lo and behold, there's the EIN and it finds my data from my employers payroll servicing!! - But - I can't download as it is asking for my wages from my W-2 Box1 to confirm. I'm still stuck waiting for my employer to make it available/mail.

I continue to be impressed. It is working as best as I would expect in early January. The navigation has been intuitive. I'm still glad I made the switch.

** Update 20Jan15
- Another update from Quicken today. It took about 30 seconds including download (1MB/s)
- Attempted to download my 1099-DIV from my financial institution. I clicked the import and a comprehensive list of financial institutions popped up in a selection list. I selected mine but, unfortunately, after connecting to the institution I got a message back indicating the data won't be ready for download until February 2nd.",New convert from TurboTax and no regrets so far!

Sure, costs go up everywhere, but seriously, $30-$40 more for the same software H&R does?  Oh, and the $10 off for prime members isn't enticing either because as most people know, it'll be $10 cheaper at costco next month anyway. (Update: It's $20 off now because nobody is buying them)

This is the first time using H&R Block tax software and it's pretty much the same thing Turbo Tax does.  Sure, there's slight variation to format and inputting information.  But, at the end of the day, it all leads up to the same place.

Took 2 minutes to download and install.  Took my old TT 2013 information in a few seconds.  Now just got to wait until the IRS sends updates and a few more things.  I'm a happy camper.

Update (Jan 27, 2015):

Just finished my taxes and IRS accepted them.  I'm all done.

In case anyone is wondering, my taxes aren't too complicated.  The most complicated and tedious task is inputting the information for my small business.  I don't use Quickbooks to automatically transfer input since I keep my own records using customized excel spreadsheets.  But even that was relatively simple.

69211,5,H&R Block,40.95,"04 10, 2015","I've used Turbo Tax for many years but switched when TT more than doubled the cost of filing my return.  This product's user interface is close enough to TT that it made the switch very easy.  And, it's easier to use so I won't be switching back even if TT rescinds the huge price increase.  I'd suggest that the ease of use makes it a better product for someone new to doing their own taxes.  The interface is cleaner and the help is more accessible.

I did find what could be considered a bug in the program (and still there on April 7).  When the program reads your prior year TT return to get you up and running, the State refund that you applied to your estimated next-year tax is recognized only as an estimated payment.  It is not recognized as taxable income (which it is in CA and I'm sure most states).  You must look up and enter this refund manually as income in the income section.  TT did this automatically.

The H&R Block product has a handy summary that pops up temporarily or permanently if you hover the cursor over the running tax due / refund window to the left (or click on it) but you have to discover this on your own.  Since there's no reason to put the cursor over those numbers, this may not be obvious.  And, who reads manuals any more -- doing so should not be necessary in this day and age).  I strongly suggest H&R add a ""summary"" button to the header above each running total.  There is room for it.",I'll never go back to TT ...................

While I have prepared my taxes myself for many years, I have been using a tax accountant to prepare them for the last several years. I decided to once again go back to preparing my own. Being a longtime Turbo Tax user, they were my first go to. After seeing all the negative publicity regarding the changes they have made to what is included in which version, I decided to research a bit more.

Long story short, I have decided to give H&R Block a try. Cost was a good bit less than a comparable version of Turbo Tax. After using their software for a bit now, I have actually come to prefer it over the previous versions of Turbo Tax I had been using. While I would likely recommend Turbo Tax to a first time user, not so with someone who actually has a little bit of a clue as to what they are doing.

However, after I finished doing my taxes with turbo tax, it said I owed $7k for federal. So I proceeded to download H&R software and after another 2 hours, it said that I owed $1K. That's a pretty big deal. I knew turbo tax was wrong because I never paid that much in tax. I'm officially done with turbo tax. Cost twice as much as H&R and can't even get it right.",That's a pretty big deal
69310,5,H&R Block,40.95,"02 16, 2015","Reading the reviews about how badly TurboTax dropped the ball and basically alienated their entire customer base in one fell swoop, I figured I'd try out the alternative. Boy, am I glad I did! I have a side business as well as wages, so I have to buy the package that includes Schedule C. H&R Block's software that included small business features was less than HALF what TurboTax was charging.

The Amazon installer downloads almost instantly, but it's just a front end for downloading the actual software. It had my activation code ready to go, and the ~50MB H&R software downloaded very quickly (less than 20 seconds @ 160Mbps). After initial install and activation (I chose NOT to register, by the way, because I don't want emails from anyone about ""special offers"" - H&R makes it very easy not to register at ALL) it automatically detected an update, asked to download it (I noticed it was capped at 1MB/s but it's a small download), then asked if I wanted to close the program and install now, or if I wanted to keep using the software. I thought that was a nice touch. After updating and restarting, it even automatically detected last year's tax return ... from TurboTax! I never even had to point it at last year's return location, even though I manually made sure it was there with Windows Explorer beforehand. Very impressed with the automation and the user interface.

I was able to get through my wage portions, my 1099-MISC, my expenses, my deductions, my additional income, and get it e-filed in less than an hour. I am a very happy boy.

I also found the interface more intuitive and it does a MUCH better job of explaining the options than TurboTax did. I was a little iffy last year with TurboTax as it was my first year with Schedule C and 1099 income. Not a single hiccup or misunderstanding this year. It went smooth as glass and I feel like it definitely maximized my return while also balancing my liabilities with 1099-MISC income.

Great job, H&R Block. You've got yourself a new customer.

***EDIT: It definitely did everything correctly as I got my full refund less than 10 days after I e-filed!",Very Happy I Switched

So far H&R Block has been easy - it has the forms TurboTax 'regretfully' disabled, and all of my information from last year's TurboTax files imported fine into H&R Block.

69354,5,H&R Block,45.95,"01 18, 2015","I have been a Turbotax customer for many years. While I have been generally satisfied, I decided to give Taxcut a try. Last year I switched from the Windows world to the Mac world with the purchase of my MacBook Air. I bought turbotax premier for the Mac and was disappointed. In general, it just didn't navigate as well as it did on a pc. Over the last several years turbo tax has gradually required payment for features that were free. So, while I went from basic, to deluxe, to premier with audit defense, the product was becoming much less of a value. So, with the usability issues I encountered I became open to a switch. I bought the tax cut premier product last night. I haven't done anything more than transfer last years return, but here are some impressions. 1) install required an extra step to move a file to the applications folder. Only a problem since I'm new to Mac. 2) transferred last years information apparently ok, including k-1. 3) includes in the base price audit support, which I paid extra for last year with TT 4) hoping for better guidance on NY taxes, which is weak in TT 5) claims to have interactive chat support with tax experts, which would be nice, and which I don't believe are included in TT. Will update my review once I am able to continue work in my return.

Update 1/27

69355,5,H&R Block,45.95,"01 2, 2015","I have rental properties that are co-owned with another individual, this makes it amazingly easy to do my taxes and saves me hundreds on having a professional do them.  You can use the deluxe with rental properties as well--there is only a very slight difference.  I spend the extra $10 just to get everything--but it is only very minor difference.  H&R block makes it sound like the only way to do rentals is by getting the premium.  I think the only difference I can find is that it will ask you more questions.  I don't need the questions as I have done this for several years.  But since it is only a $10 difference on the day I bought I don't mind getting the premium.  There is suppose to be extra schedule C assistance.  again, the only diffrence I have noted is in the questions.  If you know what to deduct you can get by with the deluxe.  If you haven't done your own schedule C before or own rentals, then I suggest the premium at least the first year.

This is very easy to use.  They have audit support if you ever do get audited.  I like the interface better than Turbo Tax.  I find turbo tax too clunky and hard to get around for my purposes.

YOu can also ask a tax advisor questsions but I have never needed to do that.  It is a nice feature to have if you run into snags.

I did the download for the Mac and it works perfect.  I have never had troubles using on Mac.  Immediately after downloading, i began importing last years date for the 3 tax returns that I complete.  Everything went smoothly.  With this product you can electronically 5 federal returns for free.  One of the people I do returns for files electronically on federal and prints state return so she doenst have to pay for her return.  The other 2 file electronically on all.  I believe the charge for filling  state returns is $19.95.

Also, you will get updates every time one is released.  Federal and State taxes are not finalized yet.  This is not the fault of H&R block--the government delays things.  You can start filling out your taxes, but you will not be able to submit until after the Jan 15 update.  This would be True of any product.",HIGHLY RECOMMENDED--easy to use.  FOOL PROOF.

69396,5,H&R Block,40.95,"12 10, 2014","Downloaded the Win version from Amazon on 12-10-14. I also have the 2013 Win version installed on my laptop from last year.

1. (On my laptop) I clicked install and a Window popped up with something like C:\Program Files\HRBlock 2013\setup\home&biz DL.EXE already exists. Overwrite file?  (if you don't have last years version installed it would just start installing what looks, to me, like the 2013 version.)

2. So I canceled install and called H&R Block, who sent me a direct link for the program. I downloaded and clicked install but got the same C:\Program Files\HRBlock 2013\setup\home&biz DL.EXE already exists.

3. I thought the 2014 version may need to install some 2013 files for importing last years data?

4. Moving to my desktop (which does not have H&R Block 2013 installed) and using the H&R Block download, I clicked install (a window popped up with the same 2013\setup dialog file to unzip but having nothing to overwrite proceeded to install.  I looked at a couple forms in the Premium part once the program was running and they are for the 2014 Tax year. (The desktop Icons are 2014 too.)

5. The program then installed the Business part. I checked some of the forms and they are for 2014 as well, although some are still in DRAFT.

6. (Back on my laptop) I then tried the Amazon Download, I clicked install (overwrote my 2013 files) and it installed the Premium and then the Business. Again I checked a couple forms once the programs were running and they are for the 2014 Tax year.

I don't know if that will be the case for anyone else, but it was my experience.",The Amazon Download installed the 2014 Version for me.

69400,5,H&R Block,40.95,"09 10, 2015","Alright, people, this isn't perfect, but I like the price much better than Turbotax's (TT) offerings that do the home taxes and a business/partnerships/trusts.  I can get 10-15 lattes with the savings.

I started the returns in March just before I took off for the Pacific Crest Trail. I filed extensions and then completed partnership returns in the week before I left.  I went hiking and my tax returns were outa sight and outa mind.  After walking 1600 miles, I honored ""fight-Procrastination day"" a day late, but hey I did it.  I used some of yesterday to finish the personal return and revised one of the partnerships early this a.m.  No real difficulty, but just a new way to navigate the return.  If TT or HR Block kept their navigation same from year to year, it wouldn't matter.  I'd still have to relearn it every year.  I'll count myself lucky if I haven't killed the hundred million brain cells responsible for learning this stuff.

In the Review phase where the software looks for dumb things I did, it highlighted ""errors"" and permitted me to see where I'd have to make corrections.  Mostly ok, but, some of them led to forms irrelevant to my return (I'm no accountant, but I need plain English explanations.  I deleted those forms, crossing my fingers)  Other ""errors"" had no explanation for how they got there, nor any definitions.  This was no different for TurboTax in the years I used TT.

Efiling my personal return went without a hitch, though I have yet to discover if the IRS accepted the return.

I don't need the software to import data from last year's return.  I'm not re-inventing rocket science every year--it's just a tax return.  I just don't need to pay some accountant $3,000 to do this and still demand the same amount of time as me using the software.  Either this or TT beats the ##%! out of that or trying to do it with the doggone forms all over the kitchen table.","Criminy, just get this and do your taxes.  Half the price of Turboturd"

I've used H&R block for several years because the price is far more reasonable than TurboTax. However, I prefer the interface of Turbotax. That would be my only complaint with H&R - they need to ""polish"" their interface a little more. It's a bit dated and sort of robotic. Not as user interactive and easy as TurboTax. The way you have to input certain data (such as manually having to enter it on parts of the form) outside of interviews is a bit cumbersome and to someone who hasn't done their own taxes before, this could be an issue. But I've used H&R for years, always done my own taxes so I have no complaints. I have to mention though that my tax situation is much more simple than some people's. I have no kids and have had 1 W2 for the past 6 years. I opened a small business last year, so I purchased this bundle for that purpose. We will see how it goes.

All in all, for the price, you can't beat it. I use it every year. TIP: Watch Amazon around Dec-26-Jan 15th for the best deals. Monitor it daily and when you see a price you are comfortable with, go for it. FYI I got it for $50 Dec 28th. Searching online I saw it was $47.98 on Dec 27th. I don't mind paying $50 for 2 complete premium tax software packs. I think I got a great deal, thank you amazon!

I have a macbook pro and found the software very easy to install (I opted to buy the disc).  I thought the program was as user friendly and easy to follow as Turbot Tax and, in some cases, even easier.  For example,  cash donations did not require the addresses of the organizations. Non-monetary donations did not have a list of items to scroll through to find the suggested amount for each item - you had to estimate the cost yourself.  While I found this much easier as I am very good at estimating thrift store costs others may be unhappy to have that portion of the program missing from H&R Block's program.  The transfer of information from federal to state (CA) was quick, complete and problem free.  I filed both returns online via H&R Block software and both went through quickly and without any problems.  So, for me, H&R Block has a new customer.

However with the recent problem (need to spend more $ to get the same features in Deluxe) I did not want to do it.  Too bad, I know their Software well enough to teach how to use it.

Trust is hard to earn and easy to loose. Intuit's recent attempt to recover from the bad press by giving a $25 rebate still does not give me any confidence. What's next?

So I switched to H&R and while i have not yet filed my taxes, the program is working well and is easy to use. IT is also a bonus that the H&R version is noticeable less expensive than the turbo tax deluxe too.

69535,5,H&R Block,19.8266666666667,"01 17, 2015","I bought this software based on what Turbo Tax customers discussed (higher price and subtractions of options). I also posted a comment to another's review of TT and was put off by what the VP said to many customers/commenters. Dollar for dollar, H&R Block is much better. I was able to apply last year's return for the information needed, which filled in blanks that I would have had to do myself. Before launching the program, I did my own quick dry run and looked up the forms that I would need. H&R Block Deluxe matched my forms to the T. My choices might be simple (no kids, few deductions, etc.), but I do feel that the choices given would cover a great amount of options for those that have more detailed tax returns. Also, there is an update to perform; I'm not sure what would happen if you didn't do it.

As for filing, H&R gives you the choice to receive an additional amount from them if you get a refund. In my case, I would have received a 10% bonus in addition to my IRS refund. This bonus comes in the form of an account that they open for you, and once your return is approved and sent to the IRS, (I'm assuming it needs to be acknowledged by the IRS, which is no sooner than 2/14/15, H&R block is holding returns until at least then), you are given the opportunity to choose from various gift cards. You would choose which gift card(s) you wish your refund to go to, then H&R matches it by 10%, according to the fine print. I chose not to do this since the gift ""cards"" are not cards, but e-gift cards that can only be used online. Instead, I chose to receive direct deposit, which I anticipate to see applied sometime after the end of February.

I have to wonder if mailing it would have produced a faster turnaround. There are comments that the IRS will be handling more changes to tax law this year which would allegedly delay all returns. Although it looks like the IRS is accepting returns on 1/20/15, so who really knows?

Is it worth paying for software for tax prep? To me, it is. It's like having someone looking over your shoulder with a fairly up-to-date idea of how it's supposed to go. Will I buy one again? Maybe not. I've also used the recommended free software found online. I may go back to using that method if I still qualify for it. I'm still satisfied though. There were very few choices or forms that I had to look up for more information and I don't think that a return went this quickly since I was a single person. The only improvement I would make pertains to the over-simplification of the HSA account section. I would have liked more detail into who contributes, etc.","Easy to use, e-returns being held as of 1/17/15, still helpful tool, covers health act pretty well."

69855,5,H&R Block,34.6,"04 10, 2016","Prior to this year I was a long time Turbo Tax user.  I've always had something to complain about with Turbo Tax, but the problems were more annoying and usually just involved one or two nuisances I could work around.  That all changed with the 2014 Turbo Tax.  I had so many problems with Turbo Tax last year that I finally had the straw that broke the camel's back. Here are some highlights and there are actually more problems than I'm listing.
1) Price increases every year with Turbo Tax.
2) Turbo Tax is so bloated it was taking 60+ minutes to install every year and updates would often take over 10 minutes.  H&R Block Deluxe installed in about 10 minutes and updates took 1-2 minutes to install.
3) Poor programming decisions by Turbo Tax.  For example, some windows won't display when you launch them to get additional information.  Apparently the windows have to download text from Turbo Tax's own servers and on busy times like weekends, the windows may not display anything.  If you try again early on a weeknight, say 6 PM on a Monday, the same window that wouldn't display on Saturday or Sunday will now suddenly work.  Nothing like this happened when using H&R Block Deluxe.
4) Turbo Tax changed the version of their software I'd been using for years and split it into, I think, 3 different versions with different prices.  They failed to explain to existing customers that those of us who needed to report stock transactions would have to buy a new and of course more expensive version of their software.  So many people, including me, started their taxes only to find that the version we had now no longer could be used for stock transaction reporting on taxes.  Turbo Tax did give free upgrades because they admitted doing a bad job of explaining the software version changes, but the process to get the free upgrade involved having to call Turbo Tax, getting a call back over 6 hours later, and doing some very non-intuitive things to get the upgrade.  I can tell you that late in the tax season the official Turbo Tax forums had posts from desperate people who had no idea how to get the free upgrade so they could finish their taxes.
5) Turbo Tax botched my state return.  I had a special carry over state tax credit from 2013 and they put it in the wrong place on the form, which caused me not to get it.  I had to download and file an amended state tax return on my own, which quite difficult to do if you're not a CPA or tax professional and I am neither, finally getting the missing money from the credit about 3 months later.

After all that nonsense, I deregistered from Turbo Tax's annual software subscription program and they gave me a chance to tell them why.  I thought I would at least tell them what all my problems were so maybe they could fix them.  Nope.  They limited the response to something like 512 characters so all I could do was mention maybe 2 or 3 things.  It was clear to me that they aren't even serious about making a good product.

I read that H&R Block's tax software can read Turbo Tax format files.  So I bought it and indeed it can.  It read in my Turbo Tax file from last year and used it in my 2015 taxes.  I had no problems at all with H&R Block Deluxe.  It worked fast.  It worked reliably.

I have always enjoyed the ease of use and confidence I have in the results, as well as the amazing price, especially when it's Amazon's Deal of the Day, even compared to other at-home softwares. There was often, though, a part of me that wondered if a tax professional would provide a higher return. I had heard that this would be True, but I was nervous to try. Finally, this year I convinced my husband that this year we would try using an accountant, while also completing our return on the H&R Block Software to compare the results (figuring if we got a much higher return, the investment would be worth it, and if not, at least we'd know for the future). My accountant was surprised I was asking her to prepare our return because in our conversation it seemed I had a good grasp on what was necessary for my taxes (an understanding I had gleaned from years of using the software and answering the prompts and questions). In the end, she found about $50 more, but as the cost of using an accountant was more of a difference than the return she processed, we will probably return to using the software next year, with the peace of mind knowing we are getting the best return possible for the greatest tax prep price.",Produced the Same Results as a CPA!

70004,5,H&R Block,34.6,"02 19, 2016","I switched from TurboTax to HRBlock this year after I got tired of the greediness of TurboTax.  I actually started with the online version of TurboTax (until I saw the price tag TurboTax was charging me before E-filing), so I could compare the two programs.  In most part they are quite similar, but I found that the language HRBlocks uses is easier to understand. A few other observations from using both:

(1) Both program has built-in deductible valuation function. TurboTax generally give you a higher deduction on donation items given to a charity, in my case $670 vs $510 by HRBlock.  But I feel HRBlock's valuation makes better sense.
(2) Turbotax does not automatically take foreign tax paid in AMT calculation, even though I imported my 1099s.  HRBlock does it correctly.  Were not for switching to HRBlock, I would have missed the tax credit.
(3) There is a bug in the childcare form in HRBlock. It only allows four childcare providers.  When you enter more than four, it started to overwrite the first one. I had to combine two providers into one.  TurboTax has no such problem.
(4) There is a glitch in HRBlock in that the state tax return status remains ""To Calculate"" after everything is done.  I tried a few times restarting the program.  It eventually worked magically.
(5) I paid AMT last year, meaning state tax were not deducted in my final tax. When I did my regular tax, I did deduct my state tax.  For this reason, TurboTax included my state tax refund as income this year.  This is incorrect.  H&R Block correctly indicated that and I was able to exclude that part in my income.

Because of (2) and (5) (well, minus (1)), I got a larger refund by switching to HRBlock.

In conclusion, I think the expert knowledge is programmed better in H&R Block than TurboTax.  We are not tax experts and we rely on what the program tells us whether or not take a deduction or include an income. This is the reason why some people claim H&R Block gives a larger refund, as in my case. If you fill out the form correctly, I believe both will give you the same exact number of dollars in refund or extra tax.","H&R Block is better than TurboTax, but not with its own glitches"

Using this software is like using an accountant to help you with your taxes (you just pay much less.)
I did a test in 2004. I prepared my tax using H&R Block software and also used an accountant to prepare my tax. The result came the same (I got the same numbers for refund on both Federal and State taxes whichever method I used).
I also used Turbo tax one of the years, but  I like H$R block more (personal preference, nothing against Turbo Tax)

I know you can do your taxes online with H&R Block and other companies, but I'm old school and prefer to load the software on my computer and to keep my personal data off the internet. I'm really anxious to take advantage of the 10% off refund bonus they are offering this year. And if you're in no hurry you'll find the price of the software fluctuates daily and then drops off significantly several months into the tax season. This is the second year in a row I caught it on the Amazon Deal of the Day on January 2nd at a significant discount. I also will do my taxes with the free state version, but instead of paying the pricey e-file fee I print off the forms and enter the data onto our states tax site and in essence I e-file for free. Lastly, the frustration-free packaging is also a plus - just tear open the envelopment that's all there is to it and little to have to dispose of.

**03/11/2016 UPDATE**
I've now completed my taxes and took advantage of the 10% refund bonus. My refunds had made it into bank account but I hadn't received the email with the gift yet and there was nothing in the app I could find about it, however once I clicked the option to check the status within 5 minutes the email arrived with the code for the Amazon gift card.

I also noticed in the fine print that if you request a bonus gift card $600 or higher they will issue a 1099-MISC form.",Watch for Falling Prices...
70135,5,H&R Block,34.6,"01 6, 2016","Been using H&R Block tax software (Tax Cut) for more years than I can remember.
Used Turbo Tax before that for several years. Finally tried Tax Cut, now H&R Block because my Dad was using it and  the lower cost than Turbo Tax.
It has handled everything for me over the years from K 1 forms to investment forms including cap gains/losses etc.
It has even handled for me with out a hitch a necessitated amended return.
As my forms have gotten more complex over the years I have never had an issue.

Now that being said I have one recommendation:
Even though at this point in time I am very familiar with how this tax program flows I do carefully read each step in the interview and answer each question carefully. This little detail will insure you get the forms and pages you need. If you do miss something you will not get the page you need. You will have to go back and hunt it down. You are better off saying yes to a question you are not sure of. You can always skip the part when you get to it.
This year I may actually use the download function for some financial firms like Fidelity to save me manually keying in all the data. Much easier to verify and be done with it.
Actually this program makes it a joy to do your taxes, if I can say that.
The State part is just as easy because of the carry over from the Federal part.
Push of a button and its e-filed. Love it.",Still love this program after may years!

1. It has a lower price.  It's reasonably easy to use and I don't have any issue with it.  I generally use the Deluxe with State version because I have investment and mortgage.
2. I want to support the competition whenever I can (i.e., not to sacrifice too much).  With the recent price increase of the other product, I feel like I made the correct decision.

I used TurboTax for many years, but switched last year due to their software functionality change.

This worked just as well as TurboTax and they don't play tricks on you after you buy the software forcing upgrades on you. I will remain a loyal H&R Block user year to year, as long as they keep their software functionality unchanged and price low.

It worked perfectly with my return which included investments and deductions. It appears TurboTax did not learn its lesson in 2015 and continues to make investors buy the Premier version to get full Schedule D functionality at a significantly higher price.  This just makes H&R Block Deluxe Tax software an even better buy! So in 2015 I've again purchased H&R Block Deluxe without any hesitation.  It is easy to use, it is updated frequently,  it includes the State Tax Return and you can file online.  The software has already imported my 2014 H&R Block return data flawlessly but it will also import your TurboTax data.  So if you want good tax software at a reasonable price, H&R Block is the one for you.

70143,5,H&R Block,34.6,"12 21, 2015","I was a user of TurboTax for years but they just got too greedy.  I think that they are over priced and certainly do not provide a product that is much superior to H&R Block (formerly TaxCut).  I have had little difficulty over the years (10) and when I do, it usually is the KY state program.  They do not do a very good job of spliting out income and Schedule A deduction percentages if you file ""married filing separately)  for KY.  However, with a calculator and a little inconvenience, you can force the program to do what you want. They provide very good support for investment 1099Bs and 1099Divs. If you are not familiar with how to handle these they ""spoon feed"" you right through it. Also, if your investments have not changed from last year they will be read in for you and you just have to update with this years figures.  I like being able to pull up the actual forms(if you want) to see exactly where the investment figures are going on the Schedule B. You get a number of printing options.  I usually print out my return with all of the worksheets for my own records (putting a copy aside for reference for next year's return) and then a printed copy of my official return even  though I EFile. I am fortunate to only have one state return to contend with but can't blame those that complain about the price for additional states. That is just gouging in my book!

So this second year using H&R Block went well. Although, as last year, the program displays a few rough edges, easily worked around. For example, during this year's final Federal review, the program spotted an ""error"", which turned out to be the word ""None"" in a field completely unrelated to my tax situation. I had not supplied any data (let alone typed ""None"") in that part of the tax form. H&R Block would not let me proceed with the filing process until I had manually displayed the form, clicked the cursor into the field, and backspaced over the word ""None"".

This year it looks like H&R Block Basic is about half the price of TurboTax Basic. Beautiful. I'm still waiting for some 1099's, but I've already started my taxes by importing my W-2. Easy. Looks exactly like last year and that went really well. So, I'm going to take the liberty to five star this now since last year's experience was an easy 5 stars.

How does this software compare to TurboTax? It's just as easy. It mostly works in the same way as TurboTax with small differences here and there. The interface is much snappier than the 2013 version of TurboTax - the last version of TurboTax I used.

If I may take a moment to bash Intuit (the makers of TurboTax): That company actively lobbies against making tax filing easy. Just Google ""TurboTax Lobbies Lawmakers to Keep Tax Code Complicated"" for an ABC News article on the subject.

70222,5,H&R Block,54.0,"11 21, 2015","I just finished my preliminary tax return and happy to report that I have not encountered any problems. Overall, the interface looks very similar to last year.  I purchased the H&R Deluxe + State, but the Federal portion is identical, so I am reposting the Federal portion of the review for reference here.

I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both H&R Block and TurboTax to compare. I found that both programs satisfied my needs but H&R Block costs consistently less. I have been buying the Deluxe version of H&R Block because it covers it the mutual funds sales and cost basis calculations are included (Schedule D) and the form for Foreign Tax Credit from mutual funds is present (Form 1116). To get this functionality in TurboTax you need to buy the Premium version of the software.

The price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter ""Amazon price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word ""camel"" (repeated 3 times) in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached. During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $34.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.

' INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
' I had no problems with my install. However in 2013 I helped a friend resolve an install problem on a Windows 8 PC us installing from a CD. I am including what we did again as I know a few people told me in helped with 2014 install. Normally the automatic install runs a file called ""tcauto.exe"". This file in turn calls another program located under ""installers"" directory which actually does the work. We were able to by-pass the error by executing the exe program in the installers directory directly, this year it should be called ""HR_Block_Tax_Software_2015_Deluxe__State_-_Windows_CD.exe"" (it is the only file in that directory).

' If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

' If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you download it. The key-code can be located several ways.
Option 1: In the past when my download finished the install started automatically and offered me a choice of two links ""View Keys"" and ""Install"".
Option 2: This year the install did not start automatically so I clicked on the install program myself, and on the first screen it asked for ""Activation code"". When I purchased the software Amazon sent me a message which included a Product Code (note that they did not call it Activation code) which is the number I needed.
Option 3: You can locate it in your Amazon account:
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

' If you have a virus scanner it will generate an alert the first time you run the program, change the permission to ""Permit Always"" otherwise the program will be blocked.

' Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs?
I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic ""Installing Software on Another Computer""
I quote the FAQ answer below:
""There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.
Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer.
Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.
The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, ""Can I install the software on a second computer?""
Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate.
You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.""

' WHAT IS INCLUDED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I purchased H&R Block Deluxe entitles me to 5 free federal e-files. It allows me to print and mail as many returns as I want, there is no limit on printed returns.

' GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until mid January of 2016.

' Pet Peeve: H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version. That would have been useful.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations.

' Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on ""learn more"" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.

' H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

' DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC. It suggests reasonable prices based on condition of the donated item and it is nice not to have to come up with what is reasonable on my own.

' Pet Peeve: I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

' At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

' Sometimes I want to return to some section of my return. The best way to jump to any section directly without navigating through other pages is to use ""take me to"" button which is displayed at the top of every page, on the same line as H&R Block banner.

' Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?
Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.

' The final tax return can be saved in a .PDF format for future reference.

'  In 2014 TurboTax's introduced a requirement that the data had to be sent to Intuit's servers to be formatted for printing. I verified that H&R Block can print forms when Ethernet connection is disconnected.

'  If you owe taxes there are three options for payment: electronic withdrawal from your bank, mailing a check and paying by credit card from a secure web site. Is there a charge to pay by credit card? Yes. There are three web sites that do this service and the fees vary from the lowest of $2.50 flat fee for a debit card to highest of 2.25% fee by credit card from one of the web sites.  If you search for ""pay taxes by credit or debit"" you will see the detailed fee schedule on the irs.gov web site.

' IDENTIFY THEFT AND TAX RETURNS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
' Last year there were many reports of thieves filing fraudulent tax returns using stolen social security numbers
If this happens the person who tries to file their own tax return gets the following error:

IRS records show the spouse's Social Security number (SSN) on this return is the same as the primary taxpayer's SSN on another return already filed this year. Double-check your spouse's SSN. Fix any issues and e-file again. Otherwise, you'll have to file a paper return.

What to do if this happens?
1. Call HRB told them of the issue (1-800-472-5625)
2. Call IRS (1-800-829-1040) had them flag the SS#
IRS states that people need to mail completed return, a copy of police report or Form 14039 Identity Theft Affidavit (...), copy of Drivers License or passport or SS card.
3. Call Equifax and have them put an alert on the SS# (They notify Experian and TransUnion as well)
4. Call Social Security Administration and notify them (1-800-772-1213)
5. File with FTC (...)
6. File a police report of a possible identity theft

I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. I keep coming back because it works well for the tax forms I need to do and it is less expensive than TurboTax. If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.

70292,5,H&R Block,54.0,"03 7, 2016","Very Happy with it.  I used a competitive product since 1994, but the price of that product has grown to what I consider a ridiculous level ($90 for the Premier level required for basic capital gains, though I've seen it for less here on Amazon).  For reference, our neighbor has a professional that comes to his house to do his taxes for $150.  So, I feel this is a real bargain.
I hadn't used this product before, but I found it as easy to use as the competitive product.  Different, but not that different.  Actually less of the annoying up-sells throughout the process.
No problems with installation, and no background software installed (i.e. no Cdilla like competitive product).
I was able to jump-start the return by importing last year's return (yes, from the competitive product).  Last year's AGI was indeed correct when it came to file, but I double-checked anyway.  It imported the data from my brokerage account just fine.  The Bank 1099-Int and W2 had to be manually entered (my institutions didn't happen to be on the list), but they were just revisions from last year's data.  The activation code was pre-populated when it came to e-file, but the knowledge that the Activation Code = Product Code would have been helpful had it not.
I have no problem that it didn't include the State return.  I see some people rated it a 1 just because of that, but I don't think that's fair.  If it wasn't initially clear initially, it certainly is now.  I've done State taxes in several states, and they are generally short and quite easy.  Illinois has it's own online ""e-file"", and Arizona has an auto-calculate PDF.  Both seem to me to be as easy to use as the using a tax package. I don't need the software product for the state, and I don't think most people do.  If you feel you do, this still ends up being cheaper than the competitive product, even when you include the state e-file option.
Bottom line is that I'm very happy with it.",Very Happy with it.  Feel it's a bargain

I e-filed for two relatives also (5 e-files included.)  I feel that a desktop computer with my own copy of onboard software is more secure than using a website.  I keep my copy of the returns locally, and the data is only passed through Block to the IRS.  It is still possible for someone to file a spoofed return, but there is no software-company website login where the ID thief could login to see all my records.  There is an additional e-filing requirement now - a driver's license number.  This seems reasonable, as the SSN and AGI numbers are too easy to obtain (especially if someone gets access to last year's filing.)  I have been using TaxCut/H&R Block for many years and have no complaints.  I don't bother with State as my state tax is fairly simple and the fill-in forms are all available free on the state site.

I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both H&R Block and TurboTax to compare. I found that both programs satisfied my needs but H&R Block costs consistently less. I have been buying the Deluxe version of H&R Block because it covers it the mutual funds sales and cost basis calculations are included (Schedule D) and the form for Foreign Tax Credit from mutual funds is present (Form 1116). To get this functionality in TurboTax you need to buy the Premium version of the software.

The price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter ""Amazon price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word ""camel"" (repeated 3 times) in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached. During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $44.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.

' INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
' I had no problems with my install. However in 2013 I helped a friend resolve an install problem on a Windows 8 PC us installing from a CD. I am including what we did again as I know a few people told me in helped with 2014 install. Normally the automatic install runs a file called ""tcauto.exe"". This file in turn calls another program located under ""installers"" directory which actually does the work. We were able to by-pass the error by executing the exe program in the installers directory directly, this year it should be called ""HR_Block_Tax_Software_2015_Deluxe__State_-_Windows_CD.exe"" (it is the only file in that directory).

' If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

' If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you dowload it. The key-code can be located several ways.
Option 1:  In the past when my download finished the install started automatically and offered me a choice of two links ""View Keys"" and ""Install"".
Option 2:  This year the install did not start automatically so I clicked on the install program myself, and on the first screen it asked for ""Activation code"".  When I purchased the software Amazon sent me a message which included a Product Code (note that they did not call it Activation code) which is the number I needed.
Option 3: You can locate it in your Amazon account:
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

' If you have a virus scanner it will generate an alert the first time you run the program, change the permission to ""Permin Always"" otherwise the program will be blocked.

' Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs?
I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic ""Installing Software on Another Computer""
I quote the FAQ answer below:
""There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.
Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer.
Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.
The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, ""Can I install the software on a second computer?""
Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate.
You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.""

' WHAT IS INCLUDED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I purchased H&R Block Deluxe plus State. This version entitles me to 5 free federal e-files. It allows me to print and mail as many returns as I want, there is no limit on printed returns.

One state software is included in the package but the package does NOT include free e-file for the state return (see one exception below). If you want to e-file your state return you will need to pay a fee of $19.95 to e-file each state return. Alternatively, you can print all the forms and mail them using US post office without any additional fees. If you need to file taxes for an additional state, each additional state is $39.95 plus $19.95 e-file fee.

Note 1: NY state residents can e-file state returns for free if their income is $60,000 or less.
Note 2: It is not possible to e-file a state return for New Hampshire, it has to be mailed in.

' GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until mid January of 2016.

' Pet Peeve: H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version. That would have been useful.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations.

' Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on ""learn more"" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.

' H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

' DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC.  It suggests reasonable prices based on condition of the donated item and it is nice not to have to come up with what is reasonable on my own.

' Pet Peeve: I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

' For folks trying to download State Forms. The state forms are not available as of 11/20/2015. H&R web site says they will become available in January.  To see the latest status you can go to H&R website, click on Dowload software, then hover over  ""Download Software"" on the top banner and select ""State Editions"". Currently it says ""Coming soon in January 2016"".

When the state forms became available and  teh state software can be downloaded directly from the program.

' At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

' Sometimes I want to return to some section of my return. The best way to jump to any section directly without navigating through other pages is to use ""take me to"" button which is displayed at the top of every page, on the same line as H&R Block banner.

' Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?
Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.

' The final tax return can be saved in a .PDF format for future reference.

'  In 2014 TurboTax's introduced a requirement that the data had to be sent to Intuit's servers to be formatted for printing. I verified that H&R Block can print forms when Ethernet connection is disconnected.

'  If you owe taxes there are three options for payment: electronic withdrawal from your bank, mailing a check and paying by credit card from a secure web site. Is there a charge to pay by credit card? Yes. There are three web sites that do this service and the fees vary from the lowest of $2.50 flat fee for a debit card to highest of 2.25% fee by credit card from one of the web sites.  If you search for ""pay taxes by credit or debit"" you will see the detailed fee schedule on the irs.gov web site.

' IDENTIFY THEFT AND TAX RETURNS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
'  Last year there were many reports of thieves filing fraudulent tax returns using stolen social security numbers
If this happens the person who tries to file their own  tax return gets the following error:

IRS records show the spouse's Social Security number (SSN) on this return is the same as the primary taxpayer's SSN on another return already filed this year. Double-check your spouse's SSN. Fix any issues and e-file again. Otherwise, you'll have to file a paper return.

What to do if this happens?
1. Call HRB told them of the issue (1-800-472-5625)
2. Call IRS (1-800-829-1040) had them flag the SS#
IRS states that people need to mail completed return, a copy of police report or Form 14039 Identity Theft Affidavit (...) copy of Drivers License or passport or SS card.
3. Call Equifax and have them put an alert on the SS# (They notify Experian and TransUnion as well)
4. Call Social Security Administration and notify them (1-800-772-1213)
5. File with FTC (...)
6. File a police report of a possible identity theft

I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. I keep coming back because it works well for the tax forms I need to do and it is less expensive than TurboTax. If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.

However, after about a decade of using this software, their questions have gotten a lot better.

70532,5,H&R Block,54.0,"04 20, 2016","I had used Turbo Tax until it came on the market. During the 2014 filing season, the company effectively lost me as a customer --- permanently. (I won't get into it, but here's an article that explains how it started: [...]. Turbo Tax also is allegedly the source of a data breach, which resulted in some users experiencing identity theft. I actually have two close friends who discovered that filing through Turbo Tax last year likely resulted in someone stealing their identity and filing fraudulent tax returns in their names. From a statistical standpoint, it's scary to think how many people were affected if I know two of them! In addition to these issues, I often found Turbo Tax to be a bit glitchy, and the instructions could sometimes be confusing. I say all those negative things to reinforce the sheer awesomeness of H&R Block Tax Software! It's just great:
*Significantly less expensive when compared to Turbo Tax
*Easier to follow instructions
*Less time consuming (it took me less than half the time to complete my returns; I couldn't believe it when I was finished!)
*Optional 10% Amazon refund bonus --- and then they send you special discount deals to boot (this might have been the best part!)
*And more!
I'll never go back to Turbo Tax; I don't know why I didn't switch sooner. Actually, I do: I got it in my head that I'd need to ""re-enter"" a bunch of my personal information if I switched software. I felt like I ""had"" to use Turbo Tax, essentially because I'd had more than a decade invested in using it. The reality is that you can upload a PDF of last year's return to H&R Block software. I sort of felt captive to Turbo Tax, whereas I feel like I'd never had any reason to want to leave H&R Block. If it's possible to make doing my taxes enjoyable --- yuck --- H&R Block Tax Software comes the closest!",I should have switched to H&R Block sooner!

(However, Amazon increased the price to squeeze people as the deadline approaches, so the discount is smaller than I received.)

I received my refund exactly on schedule. I had signed up for the 10% refund-bonus program. If you commit part of your refund (up to $5000) to Amazon gift cards, then you get an extra 10% free.

70581,5,H&R Block,54.0,"03 25, 2016","Turbo Tax was the first software that I used to prepare my personal tax forms and I loved it because it shortened my tax return preparation time by days. I used it for several years and I switched to Tax Cut (H&R Block's tax software) only because it was less expensive. I think both products are excellent and they are similar in their approach. I have been using H&R Block Software (they changed the name a few years ago) every year since the switch and I plan on continuing to use it.

In past years I've always purchased the CD version of the software, but this year I purchased the digital download version because I planned on using it on a laptop which doesn't have a CD/DVD player. The first thing the software does when you begin to use it is to check to see if there have been any changes or updates to the software since it was created. The great thing about the software is that it pulled up the tax return from last year that I had  prepared last year. This means that I don't have to enter any of my identifying information and it provides the employer/payer information from before, that you can modify or delete. This saves so much time when you have the same employer, bank, or income payer as before.

I buy the version of the software for people that itemize their deductions and I get one included state tax form. The package allows for 5 free e-filings and unlimited print and mail returns. I print and mail my state return because to e-file the state return costs approximately $20. Last year, even though I mailed in my state return, I received my refund in a couple of weeks.

Tax preparation is no fun for me and I certainly don't look forward to doing it. I also prepare the returns of family members. H&R Block Tax Software makes the job so much easier and almost enjoyable. You don't have to be an accountant to prepare your own tax return and you can save a lot of money by letting the software ask you all the same questions that an accountant would. If you can fill out forms, you don't have to know any tax law or even have math skills as the software will walk you through it all. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to try to prepare their own tax return and save a lot of money that would otherwise go to your tax preparer.",Saves so much time by pulling in previous year's information

I downloaded from Amazon 2/28/2016 and then received an update online. Another update is supposed to be available today. I finished with my taxes using this product on 3/1/2016 and it worked mostly flawlessly. I've used HR Black Deluxe for 5 years now. I had only one state to process, a Roth Conversion, 1095, some 1099s, etc. Nothing went wrong at all. This is the first time I accessed my 1099s at the institutions, no troubles. My only complaint is that when I get to a section and I know I don't get K1s anymore or do business with a bank, etc., I should be able to uncheck the box and not go there. Even if I did it last year, I should know if I received action items this year or not. The other thing is if I print my entire 1040 and schedules double-sided, it should let me specify whether I want each new form to begin with a new page or just stream it all onto the least number of sheets. It does the latter, if you want breaks between forms you have to print each separately. No worries, no fear. This costs way less than Turbo Tax Premier and does just about everything TTP does. It does investments, you'll need HRB Premium for rental income and small businesses.",No Worries! No Fear!

I was hesitating to switch but the price gap is too large to ignore, in order to cover stock/investment turbotax premier is needed this year which is $70, while I got H&R block for $22 from newegg.  Also have no trouble importing previous Turbotax file to the software.

The difference is there but not worth a gap like $50. H&R block still has a lot to improve especially the ways they conduct the interview. Lots of questions and selections are not made clear enough compared to Turbotax. Also the GUI doesn't look vivid.  I need to think a lot before choosing option to proceed further,  although the software seems to correct quickly even the wrong pick was chosen at first place.

This year I start getting the Intuit emails asking me to come back and they said they put things back into their software that they removed last year (not 100% sure) so I decided to compare the two products (features and cost). In the email that I received they didn't offer any kind of discount so per usual TT cost more than the H&R Block software. Today I get an email from Amazon indicating a big sale on tax prep software. I click the button and find this great price.

To me tax preparation software is just an added cost to my taxes. If I didn't have any income or my income and expenses were simple then I wouldnt need tax prep software. Since thats not the case, I need a tool to help me. The cost of the tool  which only works for one year  is an added cost of my taxes. I found last year that the H&R Block software worked for me and with a savings of over $20 compared to the TT version it was a no brainer to use the H&R Block software again this year. I don't need to buy the TT name, I just need a tool that works, and based on my results last year I expect it to work again.

Observations so far

I downloaded the software and loaded it on my Windows 7 64 bit machine with no issues at all. When I started it I was asked to create/use an account on their web site. I created one last year so I went over there to verity it was still there and had a minor hassle entering my password (you have to type it in  you cant do a copy/paste). My account was still there. I then checked for updates  none yet. I imported my tax info from last year  no problem. A little quirk - when I saved my taxes for this year it picked a different directory than where it imported my taxes from last year  I just had to change to the old directory to save it. The software says the next expected update is Jan 7.

Thats it for now. Ill update my review once I start entering my tax information.",Sticking with H&R Block for this year too
70802,5,H&R Block,54.0,"01 2, 2016","I used TurboTax for many years, and it definitely made the unpleasant task of doing my taxes faster and easier. However, Intuit started using heavy-handed marketing tactics to extract more money from their loyal customers. Every tax season I would check the reviews on Amazon, and TurboTax customers would be raging about Intuit's latest scheme to make TurboTax users pay extra for features that were formerly included. I felt like I was being shaken down.  So I read reviews, and switched to H&R Block last year.  I downloaded it from Amazon and installed it, no problems. It imported my TurboTax return from the previous year, no problem, and using H&R Block was equivalent to using TurboTax. My son-in-law comes over every year to use my tax software, he also had no problem switching from TT to H&R Block.

I just downloaded H&R Block 2015 Deluxe from Amazon, and installed it on my Win10 computer. Amazon sends you an email with the 8 digit product code, just copy and paste that into the box when the install process asks for it. Amazon stores your software downloads in ""Your Account, Your Games and Software Library"", so if the power fails or for some reason you need to reinstall H&R Block in the future you can download it again. I noticed some reviewers had problems downloading and installing, that is probably due to problems with their computer or internet connection. If that happens you can log in to your Amazon account from a good computer, go to ""Your Account > Your Games and Software Library"" and download it onto the good computer.

I've imported my tax data from last year, everything is working fine so far, but I will have to wait for some tax documents to finish my return. So I can't completely review this software, but I wanted to pass on why I switched from TurboTax to H&R Block last year and that it has been a good experience.

So, it means that I have to spend the 3-5 minutes manually entering all of the W2 info in.

Original review:

I bought this a couple of months ago and just downloaded and tried to install it (I've been working 7 days a week for the last month), and I find it's the Mac version, and I have a PC with Windows 7.  But according to my Amazon download page, even though I've never installed it or used it, I can't get a refund.  And actually, I don't want a refund, just exchange it for the PC version.

Why can't software, which now requires internet registration to use, be returned if not used, like every other product on the planet?  I guess I'm forced to buy another copy, but believe me, I'll hold this against Amazon and H&R Block in the future.  The law  should require refunds on software that hasn't been used, just like every other product.  The software industry has everything in their favor, and has no responsibility or obligations for anything.  Many of the Mac reviews complain about bugs  and other problems.  If you buy a car and it's a lemon you can return it.  If you buy buggy or poor quality software, the software industry just screws you out of your money and says tough luck.","Wrong version, can't get a refund  - Edit: Amazon did a refund / exchange."

At any rate, I took the plunge on Monday, and the only thing that I could add that might help is that I saw the product code online (probably right after it downloaded) and wrote it down, so I then had it to provide when I was asked for it.  Before buying the program, I also first disconnected my external hard disk, which had caused some problems when I was first setting up the new computer, and turned the computer off and restarted it before ordering the product.
The installation was amazingly fast, updated so fast I could hardly believe it, and operated flawlessly. Today I downloaded the state program, and it downloaded, installed, and transferred the data from last year literally in seconds. The program also told me that it had found no problems with my federal entries.  I couldn't believe it.  I suspect that my old iMac, vintage 2009, would not have handled it that easily.

(I downloaded then ran the software on 2/9/16). Or, it's possible the steps I took to give it every chance to work helped out. No way for me to know for sure. However since it's possibly related to the sequence of events, and that might help others, here's what I did:

* I made sure I updated my software to the latest version of El Capitan available from Apple. Not that it probably matters, but just to be safe I also updated all other non-OS support software that might be called on by H&R Block, e.g. the Adobe suite of software (PDF stuff, etc.)  (By the way I have a MacBook Pro - about 3-4 years old.)

* I rebooted.  This ensured all system resources (buffers, caches, etc.) were cleared out and fully available.

* I logged into the Administrator (root) account.  This ensured I wouldn't have any problems with file permissions.  For computer security reasons I usually avoid running as Admin unless I absolutely need root powers, even browsing sites like Amazon, but given all of the problems others have had this minor one-time risk was a good tradeoff.

* From there I purchased the software, downloaded the file, and ran the installer.  So far so good.

* Of course, still as root, I then launched the program and ran the auto-update process.  Here's the first of two times I had to hold my breath. It took a relatively long time, 2 minutes anyway, just spinning with a ""Gathering information"" message on the screen.  However eventually that ended, and the program finished the updates.  I was up and running.

* Since I have state taxes too (otherwise why buy Deluxe?) the next step involved downloading the state program. This is the second time I held my breath. For years H&R Block has had a bug on installing & running the state program if you have and use multiple users on your Mac. I've slammed H&R Block on this in some of my past Amazon reviews. (I won't repeat the details of the bug here and the solutions; you can check out some of my past reviews if interested.) So with that in mind: a) as root I went to the State tab and downloaded and installed the state program, then b) logged out as root, switched to my normal user where I spend 99% of my time, ran H&R Block and went to the State tab. Here's where I held my breath because (as I feared) it said I didn't have a state program installed. I told it to download the state, it did, and it ran. The old bug would have hit at this point, it didn't, so H&R Block *finally* fixed that problem.  Whew.

At that point things went smoothly. I did my taxes, e-filed my federal return electronically for free, and printed my MD state return. That was last night and as of this morning the IRS has already accepted my return.

I can't comment on the accuracy problems others have had, all I can say is that for my relatively simple return it did the math accurately. (I double checked by hand.) Of course I really only need the 1040, Schedule A, and a couple of other minor forms, and I'm done.

If you do decide to purchase the program I recommend you go through a similar sequence of events. It worked for me. I was a bit nervous, I must admit, but I'm a multi-year user of H&R Block (much cheaper than Turbo Tax) and so far H&R Block gets to keep me as a loyal customer.",Updated & ran fine for me: process laid out below

The program indicated I could not efile until I updated the program; however; there were no updates available for the Federal until 2/18/16 or my state until 2/5/16, and the download sizes were both listed as 0.00 MB. I changed my security settings to allow all apps to install, restarted my machine and the problem persisted. I called the support number and spoke with a very nice lady who resolved my problem in less than 10 minutes. I provided her with my name, phone number and email address and a few minutes later she advised me to go to ""Tools"" and ""Update the program"" There was a new Federal update listed and after running the installer I successfully efiled my taxes, 10 minutes later the IRS accepted my returns. I can't say enough (good) about the H&R Block customer service agent that I spoke with, but I definitely stay with Tax Cut and steer clear for Turbo Tax.","Minor efile glitch on Mac, but excellent customer service"
70892,5,H&R Block,60.6666666666667,"01 31, 2016","Purchased TaxCut (H&R Block) last year after the Intuit TurboTax re-packaging debacle (they were trying to force people into higher-priced versions if you needed certain forms).
For last year I entered my tax information in both TaxCut and TurboTax. Both programs did just fine with my low to moderate complexity return. There was no obvious difference in completeness or difficulty. Block feels a little less Disney and a lot more professional - for example it doesn't have smiling pictures of tax accountants between sections.
Emboldened, I embarked on my father-in-law's somewhat trickier return with TaxCut. It handled that also just fine.
So I'm not looking back. Block is working very smoothly this year also for me. Recommended for people who want to get their taxes done quickly and without the drama.",Switched to H&R Block - happy and not going back
70893,5,H&R Block,60.6666666666667,"01 31, 2016","Was scared to make first-time purchase given the many reviews claiming it didn't work on their mac. Relieved to have it work for me (iMac Mid 2011, OSX Yosemite 10.10.5). Some mentioned it was glitchy and didn't open. The program did need time to update and search my files. I was sweating bullets when it was taking some time. I almost thought it stalled, but after waiting, the program ran through its install and update fine.

I found the program easy to use. I've been using Turbo Tax the last few years. Both are pretty simple to use. This one doesn't ""look"" as sleek as Turbo Tax did, but it gets the job done fine (I should note, my taxes are simple and require only a 1040 so if yours is complicated I don't know what that experience is like). Took me less than an hour.

I did debate whether or not to use Turbo Tax again this year. Both TT and H&R had similarly mixed reviews. What won me over to try H&R was the 10% Amazon bonus that TT no longer has (btw you can load up to $5,000 of your return to get $5,500). Overall, program worked flawlessly for me, I was able to add the bonus at the end without a problem.

Oh, and yes, fed e-file is free, state e-file is $19.95 additional, but with the bonus I didn't mind paying for the convenience.","Amazon Bonus pushed me to ditch TurboTax, I'm glad I did"

I do my own tax return, mainly because I have complex tax situations...more than 7 schedule K-1 forms from various private placement investments (including 2 oil exploring investments with complex tax codes), more than 10 rental properties, and a sole proprietorship (for stock trading).  First of all, not all the tax-filer have the related experience or knowledge to handle my tax return (especially, the complex tax codes from oil exploring investments). Or it will cost me a fortune for an experienced CPA to do my tax return.

I was using Turbo tax initially, but I didn't find special advantage in Turbo Tax when comparing with H&R Block. So, I switched over to Tax Cut, and I have been using H&R Block for the past 8 years. It's not only cheaper, but also capable of handling my tax return's needs. It has an easy interview process to guide people to enter information. It allow me to fetch specific form to make manual modifications. I can do if-else analysis to assess different tax strategies with it. The cost of purchasing additional state tax packages is low (rental properties in various states that require me to file multiple state tax returns.).

To my experience, both Turbo Tax and H&R Block are not much difference in functions and capabilities. But I would recommend H&R Block for its value. (Don't get me wrong...I am not saying Turbo Tax is bad. But it's more expensive.)",Great Value for a capable Tax Software.

Ordinarily I go out and purchase the actual disc at an office supply superstore.  I was always a bit hesitant to download software.  I'm afraid I am somewhat technologically challenged and would freak out if something went amiss. But this year I decided to take the plunge.  Late yesterday I downloaded the new H & R Block 2015  Premium + State Tax Software. The download went off without a hitch and in just a few moments I was in business.

This H & R 2015 Premium tax software guided me effortlessly through our federal return.  Admittedly our return is not all that complicated but I appreciated the useful tips provided all along the way.  The entire process took around 90 minutes.  There was only one possible adjustment that might have been needed and I was able to investigate and satisfactorily resolve the matter in just a few minutes.  When I think about the amount of time I used to spend preparing simple federal and state returns I am more than happy to ante up for this product.

It has been my experience that the H & R Block tax software continues to get a little bit easier to use each and every year.  I used to use Turbo Tax years ago but I really do prefer this product.

The process was way easier this time.  I noticed a few more tips and changes in this version than in 2014.  It just flowed smoother.

I had used Turbo Tax for AT LEAST the 10 years previously so it was a tough choice to make.  I decided to take a chance on H&R Block again for 2015.  I'm happy I did - I wanted to get an early start so I would have an idea of our upcoming tax situation due to some changes this year.  This year, so far, was as easy to complete as last year.

I have rental properties so the Premier version is a must.  I have an accounting background and can manage may way around tax forms if needed yet this does provide exactly what it should provide.  A great interview process.  The ability to hop around to different topic.  If i'm afraid I'll forget to go back to a page, I'll mark the amount as tentative so it pops up later.

I review the results in depth.  It was exactly the correct result  And I love the option to download this instead of waiting for it to arrive.  I had to contact customer service because I didn't know how to find my key and they responded very quickly (as in <1 hour).  Very impressive.

My only complaint is that the Idaho download isn't available yet.  It keeps getting bumped by a few days.  At the same time, I'd prefer they (their developers) have it correct rather than push something out that isn't ready.  I've had that happen before and waiting a few extra days won't be too horrible.

I do my own tax return, mainly because I have complex tax situations...more than 7 schedule K-1 forms from various private placement investments (including 2 oil exploring investments with complex tax codes), more than 10 rental properties, and a sole proprietorship (for stock trading).  First of all, not all the tax-filer have the related experience or knowledge to handle my tax return (especially, the complex tax codes from oil exploring investments). Or it will cost me a fortune for an experienced CPA to do my tax return.

I was using Turbo tax initially, but I didn't find special advantage in Turbo Tax when comparing with H&R Block. So, I switched over to Tax Cut, and I have been using H&R Block for the past 8 years. It's not only cheaper, but also capable of handling my tax return's needs. It has an easy interview process to guide people to enter information. It allow me to fetch specific form to make manual modifications. I can do if-else analysis to assess different tax strategies with it. The cost of purchasing additional state tax packages is low (rental properties in various states that require me to file multiple state tax returns.).

To my experience, both Turbo Tax and H&R Block are not much difference in functions and capabilities. But I would recommend H&R Block for its value. (Don't get me wrong...I am not saying Turbo Tax is bad. But it's more expensive.)",Great Value for a capable Tax Software.

 INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

 If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you dowload it.  The key-code can be located two ways.
Option 1: After my download finished the install started automatically offering me a choice of two links ""View Keys"" and ""Install"". When I selected view key-code after a fairly long pause it displayed my key-code in a browser window.
Option 2: You can locate it in your Amazon account:
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

 Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs?
I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic ""Installing Software on Another Computer""
I quote the FAQ answer below:
""There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.
Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer.
Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.
The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, ""Can I install the software on a second computer?""
Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate.
You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.""

 WHAT IS INCLUDED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I purchased a digital download version of H&R Block Deluxe plus State. This version entitles you to 5 free federal e-files.  You can print and mail as many returns as you want, there is no limit on printing.

One state software is included in the package but the package does NOT include free e-file for the state return (see one exception below). If you want to e-file  your state return you will need to pay a fee of $19.95 to e-file each state return. Alternatively, you can print all the forms and mail them using US post office.  If you need to file taxes for an additional state, each additional state is $39.95 plus $19.95 e-file fee.  Ouch!

Note: NY state residents can e-file state returns for free.

 GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until January 9, 2014.

 H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version.  That would have been useful.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations. Last year I had to do both and I found the guidance in Deluxe package was sufficient to complete the forms.

 Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on ""learn more"" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.

 H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

 DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC.  You no longer need to enter this information on H&R web site.  I prefer having this information locally on my PC for better security.  The change from web site to local PC was introduced last year and I was happy to see that this change is here to stay.

 I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

 I use large font option on my monitor display and in the past years had display issues on some forms (text boxes were display overlapping each other on some forms). This year all forms displayed properly.

 I usually purchase tax software as early as possible to help me with end year tax planning. However, if timing is not important to you be aware that the price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter ""Amazon price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word camel in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached.  During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $44.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.

 For folks trying to download State Forms. The state forms are not available as of 11/17/2013. You have an option of entering email where you will be notified as soon as the form for your state becomes available. Alternatively, you can go to H&R website, click on ""Download Software"" on the top banner, and select ""State Editions"".  Currently it says ""Available in January 2014"".

When the state forms will become available they can be downloaded by selecting the State Tab and then clicking on the button labelled ""Buy"" (a little scary since we already paid for it) but then ""buy"" will turn into ""update"" and the forms will be downloaded to your computer.

 At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

 Update: To post an answer to a good question asked via a comment:  Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?
 Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.

 Update: Several people asked me via comments if Schedule C is included in Deluxe edition because it is not explicitly mentioned in the description.  Schedule C form is included and covered in the interview.

I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years.  I keep coming back because it works well for the tax forms I need to do and it is less expensive than TurboTax. If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.

I swear, I think a 10 year old could fill in the information properly because it's almost impossible to make a mistake with the way H&R Block lays out the questions they ask, which decide what you need to do or provide as information.

And, I love that then, in successive years, they give a comparison sheet that print out with your taxes, showing the differences in certain categories for the last few years vs. the current year.  And, of course, once it's filed (I e-file it), you can still pull it up any time you need it again to print out or to get information for whatever purpose.  In fact, I think the IRS has recommended it on their website from time to time, although the IRS does not actually endorse any specific tax prep. people or software.

The sweet thing about the second and subsequent years of use is that it imports data from the previous year, so many of your forms are already partially completed and all you need to do is update dollar amounts.

I have chosen HR Block the last five years because they always seem to be priced lower, therefore providing more bang for the buck.  Note - the nearer April you can buy this software, the cheaper it tends to got.  Note 2 - you will still have to pay about $20 to efile for state, only the federal is free.

My taxes are not complicated, but this year I had need to utilize more features of the software.  I took advantage of the deductions tool for all our mortgage and charitable giving needs.  We also built a home and sold a home last year, and HR Block was able to successfully walk me through the tax implications of all that fun.  We also do a little bit of personal stock trading with Sharebuilder, and I was able to easily import all of our tax info directly into the software, saving me a small headache.

HR Block always reminds us of the little things that we may forget to claim on our taxes like a $250 deduction for a teacher's expenses.  Things like that are small, but noticeable and appreciated. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes to do their own taxes...it's easy!",Excellent as expected
71327,5,HRBB9,81.32,"05 4, 2014","Dear Amazon Customer

These days it costs you a LOT of money to get an accountant or other tax preparation service to fill out your IRS 1040 Income Tax Forms, as well as the state forms. Several years ago I was charged  ~$750 for an accountant. I called and found that H & R Block Walk In Office Visit was not much less.

Three years ago my good friend in Wooster OH, introduced me to  H&R Block Tax Software Deluxe: And I am very glad he did: Each of the past three years has been very successful, and cost from Amazon great at $25, when I purchased relatively late in the season (around mid March 2013. My On-Line Amazon purchase was smooth: Then it said click here for the Internet Download, which was fast and easy: The install in my old XP (and Win7) Computers went like a charm, and once installed, HRB Deluxe  works flawlessly, no matter how many times you go back and make corrections to previous numbers typed!!  :=-))  Although HRB Deluxe, does a great job when it comes to bringing in the names and numbers from last years 1040, the whole process for typing in all the new data fields, for income, expenses, deductions, etc takes a long time: But this is not HRBs fault: Its just that we have two retirement incomes, a farm out of state, two trust accounts, and many itemized deductions.

Still, I don't think there is any better way for us than the H&R Block Tax Software Deluxe + State 2013 Win [Download] Its GREAT!!

No problems.",very good software
71331,5,HRBB9,81.32,"05 3, 2014","I have used the various iterations of the H&R Block tax software for several years now. The user interface is clean and clear, no ""pizzazz"" but very straightforward, just like a good H&R Block tax consultant would be. The questions lead you through all that's needed to complete your return. I have been totally satisfied with the product.

You can get it as a CD-ROM or download it directly. The download on my DSL Internet connection took a few minutes, and worked fine from the get-go. You get the key for opening the program via email. This particular program covers both Federal and one state tax preparation. You will have to pay extra if you have more than one state in which to file. Also, there is an extra cost for filing the state taxes online.

After you finish the taxes, it reviews it and finds anything that doesn't look just right. In some cases, it just asks you to double-check to make sure you entered the information correctly. Then it allows you to file the Federal taxes by e-File, which is very easy. I found the state e-File to be too expensive to make it worth it. You can also print out all the necessary forms for the state taxes and snail mail it.

The Deluxe version is good for most average taxpayers to use. It covers regular income/expenses, investments and small business issues. If you have rental property or complicated investments, you will need to upgrade to the Premium version.

I'm not a CPA, nor a tax expert. But I would recommend this software as an easy, and inexpensive, way to accurately determine and file your yearly taxes.",Straightfoward and easy to use

This program makes that process easy. Find an extra $40 receipt? Add $40 to one place and all the things that need to change update through your return.

But the real strength are the wizards that take you through more complicated deductions. Rather than reading lots of instructions for line after line, this software asks you for the correct set of numbers, you supply them ... done.

71368,5,HRBB9,81.32,"04 16, 2014","I've used this program for the last couple years after using almost every other tax software out there.

Some people have cited issues with installations in Windows and the update process including those with last year (2012) installed.
There were zero issues for me, perhaps whatever bug was there has been fixed. The product effortlessly downloaded from Amazon, installed, and I was able to place the key code to activate and then update the program. I also had HR 2012 installed and had no need to uninstall as some reviewers reported. The program does warn to close all other running programs prior to install which I did.

I find its just as good if not better than Turbo Tax with detailed help for small business & home businesses, and its the only program I've ever used in the last ten years that was able to work through and correct errors in the return before finalizing it to be sent to the IRS. Other programs have identified errors on forms but weren't able to correct them.
HR 2013 comes with the same audit support as prior years including a live person to attend your audit, I do not think the other tax programs offer this feature. Even though I'm not planning on needing it!

I've got some more playing around with the program to do, & if there are any issues that arise that cause me to change the review & I'll be back with an update but I have no reason to doubt it won't be the great program it was last year especially after an easy install and no update issues as some reviewers experienced.",Great as usual and perfect Win 7 installation process

71377,5,HRBB9,81.32,"04 13, 2014","I've used H&R block for many years now, primarily because it is cheaper than Turbo Tax, and let's face it, all of us must be a little cheap if we are doing taxes ourselves.  Works just fine.  No complaints.",Easy breezy
71378,5,HRBB9,81.32,"04 13, 2014","I had first ordered TurboTax at a price of $39.00.  I filed out my tax info and then learned that I had to pay additional for the state.  I didn't realize that I had bought the federal tax software only.  Then when I went to buy the state I learned that it was almost the same amount as the federal.

So I deleted TurboTax from my computer and bought and installed HR Block for only $20.25.  And it worked perfectly and every bit as easy as TurboTax.

I'll be using HR Block again next year.",Works great

71387,5,HRBB9,81.32,"04 10, 2014","I have been using TaxCut since the early 1990's when it came on a floppy disk!  Several years ago TaxCut started sending me a DVD in late December with instructions on how to buy an activation code to use.  Every year the price has gone up with them asking around $50 for this very package this year.  So I decided to wait and along comes Amazon.com with an offer of $21.99 for the very same product in digital download form.  I went for it.  To me, this is a good price for what I need.  I cannot justify paying double this price and apparently H&R Block and Amazon are still making a profit on this product at $21.99 so I will more than likely be waiting for an Amazon.com deal before buying the 2014 edition next year.",Best Price Around

I found that this product gives valuable tips that saved me paying more tax than I was obliged to do.  Definitely get the state tax software package since there are differences between what deductions the Federal rules allow versus what the state allows and the Block product helps to capture each deduction.  My only negative would be how long I needed to wait to ""chat"" with a tax professional and, after waiting for a half hour, ""chatting"" with her for another half hour, she tells me my question required a ""tax professional.""  I told her I thought that was what she was and she said ""no"" she was able to assist with questions about the software but not about tax rules and she needed to get me to someone else - for whom I had to wait another half hour!",Very helpful for tax prep
