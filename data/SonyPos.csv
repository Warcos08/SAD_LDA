    Sony",4,"This game is pretty good for its own sake. It's basically about a dead warrior in a land of ghouls & zombies who attack him at every turn, & it is up to you to find the Chaos Rune, among other hidden treasures arrayed throughout this underworld of bizarre incarnations.The animations are up to 3-D par, although I will remark on the variety of different angles. The graphics are japanamistic, but nonetheless amusing.",Gravely entertaining...

    Sony",4,This game is interesting.  My sister made me pick it up and it is fun to mess around with.  If you are looking for a cute little adventure platformer then this is it.  The graphics are good and the control isn't too tricky.  It does get difficult in parts but not overly.  I am not a huge fan of platform games but this one got me with its unique humorous tones.  Give it a shot on your PS2 if you haven't.  It's a bargain.,A solid and fun game!

    Sony",5,"This game has very good graphics for a PS game and the action and music.The game is very good and has 22 worlds,although they're short.What I dont like is that,you can only save when you pass a world,and thats bad because if you're doing perfect in the world but then you die,you'll have to do it all over again.The game has 4hands up and 1con,so I recommend it if you like zombie killing,horror action games.",great!

    Sony",5,"This is a fun game.There are some better games in the history of PlayStation games,such as Crash Bandicoot:Warped,which is not violent,like this is just a little.But it's great enough to be given at least 5 stars.","Hmmm,a great game,but not the best game ever..."

    Sony",5,"THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST ENJOYABLE GAMES, I'VE EVER HAD THE PLEASURE TO PLAY !!IT IS FAIRLY SIMPLE , NOT TO MENTION LOADS OF FUN TOO !! THERE ARE ONLY A FEW HARD BOSSES , BUT WORTH THE PLAYING TIME . ONE TIP , ALWAYS STOCK UP ON AMMO , AND USE THE FOUNTAIN OF REJUVINATION ALWAYS .THROW YOUR DRUMSTICKS AT ENEMIES FOR HEALTH PICKUPS; BUT YOU GET THEM LATER IN THE GAME.  USE YOUR CROSSBOWS FOR BOSSES -AND PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE BOOKS SCATTERED THRU THE LEVELS .THEY GIVE YOU CLUES.ALL IN ALL IF YOU YOU WANT TONS OF FUN , THEN GET THIS GAME! YOU 'LL CERTAINLY PLAY IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN !!",LONG LIVE SIR DAN !!

    Sony",5,"So I was seting up for the next stream and then I found this lying around, I started to remember ""Oh man this game was a lot of fun"" so I started to play it again and it still is fun today. So here I am sitting here on Amazon.com and figured ""well since my next stream is going to be for a Playstation game why not this first?""MediEvil is a hack and slash game involving the undead, but unlike popular games that involves zombies in some way like Resident Evil this one is less....realistic. The game has a cartoon feel and the back of the box even says that, I usually love cartoons and this one fits the bill in terms of both comedy and graphics. The story is that there is this story teller for a king who kind of went off the deep end by saying he slain an evil wizard named Zarok. Zarok, who overhears this, decideds to declare war and horrified by this and believing in Fortesques (the story teller) story he sends him out to battle but Daniel goes down at the first shot with a welhelm scream and everything. 100 years later Zarok returns but so does Fortesque but this time the cowardly knight is a skeletal one.MediEvil's controls are a little awkward but once you get the hang of them it becomes quite nice, the atmosphere of this game is dark and gritty but not too much. As I said before the gameplay is a hack and slash type thing like God of War but less gory... much, much, much, much, MUCH less gory than that game and it does throw around puzzles. The game does beg for you to get every single chalice (collectables) by throwing in a lot of challenges that can make it easier to complete if you have a certain weapon such as enemies having an insane amount of health and would take literally forever to kill with your second to strongest sword. Because of this getting a 100% on this game is really easy and there is no bad ending for doing a No Chalice run if you so wish to do so.The music is outstanding and some of it is memorable, one of my favorite tracks is the ending theme of this one, the music is compose of a synthesizer and other normal instruments.So how would I rate this game, well I think this game is perfect and is and always on the number one spot of my top ten list of favorite games of all time. For that this game gets a 10/10 stars from me, music, gameplay, and graphics are always great and the controls are a bit awkward as I said but once you get used to it then this game is a blast. ALL HAIL SIR DANIEL FORTESQUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",MediEvil

    Sony",5,"Twisted Metal 2 is one of the best Twisted Metal games, I still like Black better. I liked the movie where Axel goes back to his father and rips his arms out of his machine. I hate the T rating. Buy this game NOW!",Cool stuff for all

    Sony",5,"Twisted Metal 2 was a HUGE game back in the day.  The graphics were really good for its time, and the play control, while some will probably argue with me, was always accurate and responsive.  This is truly a classic game.  It had many imitators that hardly anyone remembers these days.  Stick with the Twisted Metal series though.  You can't go wrong with the amount of destruction this game has to offer.",a classic

    Sony",5,"When I got this game I was thrown back to the days I went to my uncles house just to play this game with him. Its fun and its cool that they use real locations for the battle, because you get to blow things up and find secret path ways and weapons to defeat your enemies. I have most of all the TM games and I can't wait to have them all, even the games that where made from different game company. Because the game play over all is the same.",Yeah Boy..

    Sony",5,"This game is awesome, it is better then black except for the graphics, sound and story. But, gameplaywise, this game excels!Innocent pedestrians, secret goodies, destorying the eiphel tower, while you find and destory these things you take on several different competitors out there and utilize their special attacks to YOUR advantage. ON single player this game is kinda tedious, but on 2p, HELLO FUN. I had a buddy who played this with me every time he came over to my house. We beat the game several times, but exploiting new characters attacks and finding more goodies as we traversed really ruled!IF this game had sound and graphics, and some better storyline, this would be in the top 20 games of all time!ALso Twisted metal 4 and 3 [was not good], get tw1 or tw black instead.","The best TM, the best car combat, one of the best ever"

    Sony",5,Now this one was way more fun than TM-1. What was fun was the endings etc where it would show the little video clips. Liked seein them they were crazy. This game was fun though for sure to play with friends and all.,Super Fun Game

    Sony",5,"Being a long time Twisted Metal fan this game would have to be my favorite in the series. Amazing Soundtrack, Great level design, unique characters, and an overall fun experience, especially with friends. I highly recommend this to any fan of action games.",Best in the series

    Sony",5,"I rented this game because I am a big TM fan. I'll tell ya', this game is pretty old and doesn't have the best graphics, but it's awesome. The levels are cool. My favorite is Holland: Field of Screams. The characters are awesome too. My favorite is Minion. One of the things that I almost immediately noticed about this game was the machine guns. I don't even know why they give you machine guns on TM 3 and 4. They don't do anything. On TM 2 the machine guns actually do some damage and debris flies off other vehicles when they are hit. It would take a week to kill someone with your machine guns on TM 3 and 4. Actually you would be killed in less than a minute if all you use is a machine gun on TM 3 and 4. If you want a good vehicular destruction game, you can buy any TM game, they are all fun, but I recommend TM 2. It will provide hours of fun, especially deathmatch mode.",One of the best Twisted Metal games

    Sony",5,"Introduction:When i bought my playstation i had now clue of any twisted metal games until I played this one. I never was able to get my hands on the first one but this one is amazing.The Game:Twisted metal is a car compitition almost like demolition derby except with crazy characters and weapons. Many games have tried to copy this gameplay but none could ever create one like this. The competition is held by Calypso and he gets people in search of help to join his competition and if they win through the 8 levels of demolition they get one wish from him. Calypso is all in this for entertainment while the characters are in it for something important.The Good:This game is one of a kind and has many good points. First of all is the gameplay. It is replayable and you can chose from any vehicle/character and take him through the end of the game and see his ending story. All of the characters are unique in an individual way and they each have their own special to terminate enemies. There are plenty of weapons to pick up and fire at opponents like the homing missile and fire missile and napalm. The levels are well designed and there are eight of them to battle through. The co-op mode makes the game especially fun but takes away the story aspect at the end. Also each vehicle makes their own sound when using there special.The Bad:The graphics can be a little bit choppy at times and many of the obsticals are flat. Some of the story lines are not worth playing through the whole game, you just have to be careful who you pick.Conclusion:Overall the game is excellent and is a must buy even if our deciding to buy it now and you have a ps2.",One of my Favorite Playstation games

    Sony",5,"Twisted Metal 2 is the best playstation game ever!  The levels are fun because they are so different from one another.  Each level provides interactive fun!  The cars are great and the specials weapons are excellent!  The ending movies, like the tital suggests are twisted. I do not find this game offensive in any way and I think it good for responsible kids ages 8 and up. Everyone should buy this game.  It is the best of the four Twisted Metal games!  You will love it!",Watch out! This game will blow you away!

    Sony",5,"The Twisted Metal games in my opinion have seen their day since this gem was released.  I have spent many hours playing this game either by myself or with friends.  This game is a lot of fun with a lot of replay value.  The game boasts good graphics and sound.  I would recommend this game to anyone that is into vehicular combat, fighting games and competitive fun.",Vehicle Combat At It's Best

    Sony",5,"Even though it came out a little over six years ago, Twisted Metal 2 still stands as one of PS1's best games and the best Twisted Metal game in the entire series.  The graphics are a bit dated by today's standards, but everything else still holds up.  The environments are huge and fully interactive (you can blow up the Eiffel Tower in Paris and destroy he gown around the Statue of Liberty to reveal a bikini in New York), and the control was at its peak here in all of the Twisted Metal games.  Without a doubt a Playstation classic, this deserves to be in every PS1 or PS2 player's library.",One of the best PS1 games ever

    Sony",5,Twisted Metal two is by far the best Twisted Metal game in the series. The levels are awesome the weapons are awesome the characters are really awesome! So many memories came back to me while playing this game and it is still a very fun game to play. The controls take some getting use to since the game is over 10 years old but other then that the game has held up well over the years.,Flash back to the past

    Sony",5,"Well here's the lowdown, the twisted fighting, plot, and cars are back in this hit sequel to the best selling series Twisted Metal. TM2 brings you back into the Twisted Metal Competition. But this time, it's a one way trip 'round the world. Battle in L.A. to Hong Kong and leave a trail of destruction behind you. TM2 introduces a few new characters into the fray: Twister, Grasshopper, Shadow, Axel, and Mr. Slam. Duke it out with a wide variety of old favorited weapons to new and improved weapons like the napalm, remote detonator, and the ricochet bomb. Beat all your opponents and you might get a chance to have an audience with Calypso, the twisted creator of the Twisted Metal Competition, and have your wishes fullfilled.Bottom Line: An awesome sequel to an already awesome game",Awesome entertainment for everyone
449,Sony,5,"Jet Moto, Sony's answer to Wave Race 64, was an instant hit for Singletrac back in 1996. Singletrac, best known for its' Twisted Metal games, set out to make a futuristic racer in the vein of both Wave Race 64 and Wipeout and succeeded. Players control riders on hoverbikes which hover close to the ground and can be driven over land and water. The game utilizes a system called the Magnetic Grapple in which pressing an assigned button creates a magnetic attraction between the player's bike and red energy poles that are placed throughout the courses. This enables the rider to swing around tight turns with his bike without slowing down.  If done properly, it helps players cross gaps to large to get over as well as propelling riders out of turns alot faster than when going in. Chracters are split in teams with bikes adorned with logos of sponsors just like in real-life racing. 20 Characters and 3 tracks are available at the beginning, with seven more tracks unlockable by winning tournaments.Jet Moto is best known by fans for its' suicide courses. Tracks have a point A and point B. Racers begin at point A racing to point B and back again, all the while facing other oncoming racers coming towards them. It's also known for its' somewhat outrageous track structure mixed in with traditional courses.I fondly remember setting up all night on the weekends with friends playing this game, just to see who had bragging rights when the night was over. Most of the time they'd win but, every once in awhile, I would win. I'll admit, it took alot to beat this game. I love this game and still play it to this day.",Jet Moto......
450,Sony,4,"This game created a whole new race style. With the grapple system, it really was unique. The rider profiles and teams really made it cool. Brings back so many memories.",Play station classic
452,Sony,5,Me and my friends used to play this game non stop for hours at a time when it first came out.  It was so addicting and so much fun playing with friends.  You can even upgrade your bikes I think.  Such a fun game.,Awesome game for Multiplayer
453,Sony,5,"This is the game that got me through medical school.  I still play from time to time and definately when old friends get together.  The physics is fantastic.  The strategy is to maximize your inertia.  Turbo on long straightaways.  Turn as little as possible.  Of course you do have to turn quite a bit.  Once you have won the season you get to do stunt races, where certain stunts recharge your boost.  After mastering the game it is still fun to try and race for times (whole course under 30 min is good) or race against a friend.  The sequal JM # 3 is also great, JM #2 I was never crzy about but it looks cool for ps1 graphics.",still playing after >10 years
