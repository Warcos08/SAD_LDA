2217,1,H&amp;R Block,25.5,"04 11, 2003","I have used this program for the last three years, switching from TurboTax. I had always been happy with it so I bought it this year without looking on the Net to see if others were having troubles with it...  Yes, even bought the ""Platinum"" edition because I have a business.
  What a mistake. This new version is full of bugs (and judging from the Internet comments a quick search found, I mean REALLY full of bugs). Even though I bought it a few weeks ago, my install told me that I had a pre-January version -- so I started by having to update everything (since, the program told me, it couldn't even fill out some of the simple forms and process them without error).
  Six hours later after chugging through the forms, things started going haywire. My spouse was suddenly earning only about 10 percent of what I knew she'd earned (and which I had carefully entered on the form), my son (the program told me) needed to fill out a 1040 form of his own due to his earnings -- which I had not entered since he had none. Finding the form, I found he had ""earned"" a MINUS 7,000 some dollars.
Right.
  Then my withheld money couldn't be entered. And finally instead of owing money as I had expected, the program claimed the IRS owed me almost 10 grand.
Right.
  If you use this to do your taxes, be sure to add a ""go to jail"" button as the IRS will think you must be a crook when they see the form. It is a total mess of a program. I'm taking it back to the store and hoping I can find something that works before April 15, now that I've wasted a whole day fighting this blankity, blank poor excuse for a program.

I have not used the 2004, but I just quit working on the 2002 edition.  I got halfway through my return (20 hours work) and I finally quit.  The numbers were incorrect, but I did not notice until the last few entries.

I have rental properties and, even though I entered the information where it belonged, it somehow got transferred elsewhere.  All of my real estate taxes got moved from where they belonged to form A.  Entering the information directly onto the tax forms required me to override every single step (3 mouse clicks, I think?).  Also, I was not able to go to help and figure out what my standard mileage cost was, so it took me considerable time to go through their mileage dialogue boxes when all I wanted was standard mileage.

I had used Turbo Tax in previous years and was not unhappy with them; however, I had heard that Turbo Tax put spyware on the computer, and that it was difficult to install on more than one computer, so I decided to opt for a change.  TaxCut was cheaper, and I figured there would really be no difference (I used Parson's tax software years ago and liked them until they stopped making that program).  Anyway, at least for year 2002, TaxCut is much worse than Turbo Tax and Parson's old tax program.  The big problem is, it puts information in the wrong place; and I have been doing my own taxes for 20 years, so it is not a mistake which I am making.

I downloaded TaxAct just a moment ago; it is cheaper than either turbo tax or taxcut, and so far, it behaves just like it is supposed to.

Taxcut is poorly designed.  If you've never used Turbotax, you'll think Taxcut is OK.  I spend so much time because Taxcut will re-ask questions about ordinary dividends under a totally different section.  I have no idea if they are talking about the dividends from my equities or dividends from some other form (partnership, etc).  So then I think - hmmm - what do they want here - I don't know.
For my State Taxes I withheld my overpayment to apply for this year.  In Taxcut, I can't figure out how to get it in.  I print the form and there's a line item for it - but in Taxcut software I've gone thru every question 3 times - can't be found.
So now it says I owe state taxes and a penalty - but I don't.

2004 version has MANY bugs and the software has several mistakes that will lead you to lower tax refund!!!

I had a capital loss carryover for the last few years (didn't do too well since the dot com age)...  Every previous year, TaxCut was able to read the previous year data file and import the capital loss carryover automatically, but this year it didn't happen.  It wasn't until e-file was done and I was printing my record copy when I realize the mistake.  Funny thing is that if you look at the worksheet from last year, I clearly see the carryover amount, but the software did not recognize it!!!  I tried to call support, but it was nearly non-existent and the rep was so rude.  I recalulated the difference, TaxCut shorted my refund amount by nearly $600.

This year, the software also keep on asking you to update, but when there is no update availabe, if refuse to move on, you have to select ""Update Later"" to get around.  Stupid bug!

This is my first year e-filing, and it will be last!!!  The software never mentioned about you have to wait 24 hours for IRS' acceptance.  Had I known that, I would of choose to print and file a papercopy.  I was so looking foward to put away all my paperwork and records, but I couldn't; I had to wait more than 24 hours for acceptance before I can move on and do the state tax return.

My taxes aren't really complicated, but I like the value with the rebates and it's nice and neat and backed-up my computer.

I got Tax Cut Deluxe again and the state program for Wisconsin.

I could not get my state paperwork printed without a big ""this is a draft only "" notice plastered across it.  I finally contacted the online chat at Tax Cut and had to uninstall my Tax Cut programs and download the updates (that I thought I had already downloaded) and reloaded my Tax Cut software and do this and that  to my computer which did fix (after alot of work) my State update problems so I could print out finalized forms but now my computer has four error messages on it everytime I start up into my Windows program...never had that before.  I was going to go back to the chat line about that mess when I found yet ANOTHER problem.

I noticed earlier at one point that my final refund amounts on my federal  changed while I was simply perusing my forms after I was finished and I got suspicious.  I hadn't changed any figures during this time.  So I was ready to file my taxes and I picked up a hard copy of the federal 1040 instruction booklet.

I compared my line 43 amount on the Tax Cut prepared form to what I would have manually filled in if I had done my own taxes using the 1040 booklet.  The 1040 booklet amount is 24 dollars more (more taxes I should pay) than what tax cut calculated according to my adjusted income on line 42.

What the?  So I got back onto the chat service today and inquired as to why their calculations for line 43 were different than the amount on the tax tables in the booklet.  I was baffled, not only were they different, but the amount that tax cut figured wasn't listed anywhere in the tax tables that I could see.

The service rep wasn't very helpful...I reminded him that the tax cut program, not I, had filled in line 43 on the federal form.

He questioned the info that I had entered during my interview.  I reminded him that the amount of tax on line 43 is calculated by whatever is on line 42 (a correct adjusted gross income, I checked it out) so it shouldn't matter how that number came about.

He did some calculations on his end and using my taxable income, he got the correct tax as listed in the 1040 booklet, the amount that I was NOT getting on my tax cut calculations.

The last comment he made was, ""I see what you mean"" and then I heard nothing more from him.  I hadn't been disconnected from what I could see, I kept inquiring as to what was going on, was he checking this out, was he still there, after four minutes of dead silence (and total forty minutes of being on line with him) I disconnected.  I am very, very very unhappy about this poor service.

I will NEVER buy this product again.  I would have saved myself several hours or work if I had done this the old fashioned way.

--> The NJ state forms are printed with characters on top of each other and not readable.  Since IRS will be scanning these forms, I am not sure how long I will have to wait for TaxCut to correct the format.

--> On the boxes where it display Refund or Owe amount for Fed and State, the amounts are so far off the screen that you can't even see it.  Example: instead of displaying ""Refund: XXX.XX"" , it's displaying ""Refund:..........................................XXX.XX""

--> There are typos on the interviews.  I see questions like ""Did you ...... form New York""  It should be FROM New York.

I have rental properties and, even though I entered the information where it belonged, it somehow got transferred elsewhere.

2320,1,H&amp;R Block,20.5,"03 27, 2005","This is the second year I have used TaxCut for both my personal and small business returns. I switched from TurboTax when they started using their copy protection stuff that seemed to give every user a nightmare. Well, all I can say is, there must be two totally different software development teams working on TaxCut programs, because, while TaxCut personal is a fine program, TaxCut for business is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!

Where do I start? First, it cannot even import data from files the 2003 version created. When I tried, it hung every time, eventually forcing me to re-install the entire software package. The error log it generated showed dozens of import errors. Apparently they changed number formats (floating point etc.) and the 2004 version can't handle it. The error log also says to contact the development team but gives no way to do that. And yes, I did update the program from the web before I started.

Ok, so now I'm entering everything by hand. Like Turbo Tax, it has an interview feature, but unlike TurboTax, the interview interface is dreadfully inconsistent. Sometimes you enter info in the interview feature and hit return on your keyboard and the cursor moves to the next field, and sometimes it moves the cursor to the form! Sometimes you can enter data in interview format, sometimes you have to enter it onto the form itself. Were the programmers simply too lazy to write that feature for each page? There is simply no logical reason to make me bounce back and forth between methods!

Next, as expected, the interview has many questions where you answer yes or no if you are elegible or required to fill out certain info. However, even if you answer NO, it still takes you to those pages! Oh but of course, that only happens sometimes, other times it DOES skip the pages!

I also purchased the state business componenet for TaxCut. Despite reporting that it loaded successfully, TaxCut professional didn't seem to know the state version was there! Of course, it was more than happy to display (right next to the ""help"" button)a link to BUY the state version!

Oh but wait, if you exit the interview mode, and click on ""go"", (not the logical tab in my opinion, which would be ""FORMS""), you see a list (under ""my forms"") of all your forms, and golly, if the state forms aren't there! Of course, you can also add forms to your return under the forms tab. Careful, as you poke around trying to find the form you thought you added to your return, you may add the form again from the ""forms"" tab. The program, instead of taking you to the form you added, will instead add another copy of the same form, which you can later NOT delete from your return. I know there may be circumstances where you DO want a second copy of the form, but mostly you don't. Would it be too much for the ""forms"" section to ask if you want a new copy or to go to the one you already added?

Now, you'd expect, since the main program doesn't appear to know the state forms are there (or maybe it does ?!?!) you would have to enter data into the state forms by hand, but it's not that simple! SOME forms have SOME data automatically transferred in them, SOME forms have NONE!

And what if you need help? The help link has a simple FAQ that has a very minimal few lines then refers you to the IRS instructions. Well if the IRS instructions made any sense, I wouldn't be using a help section of a tax program. Especially one written by TAX EXPERTS!

I could go on and on, but since I've just spent an ENTIRE DAY doing these taxes, I'm burned out. FYI, I run a SIMPLE small business, I can't imagine what kind of nightmare this would be for a business with inventory, and employees etc.

It DID NOT import last year's returns saying that I didn't use the most recent version of TurboTax to do my return last year (which is NOT True!). This should have been my first signal that this software is useless.

It WILL NOT UPDATE. Since I was using the product TODAY (Feb 16) that is well past their update of Jan 27.

Another thing: my CDs were smudged leading me to believe that I am not the first person to use this package I purchased from Amazon or that the company has poor QC.

I am hoping that I get a refund from Amazon for the $89 I spent on the TaxCut Complete for Home & Business (same problem by the way) and the 24.50 I spent on the state program.

I'm always going to purchase TurboTax from now on because the technical support at for this product blows. All they did was tell me the same stupid thing over and over again (in other words, they had no idea what to do!) ($9.95 for calls to get tech support, isn't that nice?)",This product does not do what it says it will!
2325,1,H&amp;R Block,45.5,"04 14, 2005","I used H&R Block TaxCut for 2002 for Mac OS and it was really bad ... buttons didn't work, the update feature didn't work for California state, things didn't print correctly. It was very, very lame. I swore I'd never use it again ... but then Intuit managed to become even more arrogant last year (I forget what they did THIS time) and I got fed up with their taking Mac users for granted. So, based on some decent reviews here for TaxCut for 2004 (I saw these reviews about a month or so ago), I decided to give it one last try. Well, ""last try"" is right. This program just doesn't cut it, especially not for something as sensitive as doing one's taxes. The 2004 version is better than the 2002, at least (small compliment) but TurboTax is still far and away smoother, less buggy, clearer, and much better at giving you a sense that it's not bolloxing your taxes up. Examples: TaxCut's update feature is not clear; it prompts you to update the software at regular intervals (good), but instead of saying, ""you're already up-to-date"" it says ""there are no updates planned"" (confusing). I couldn't e-file my state income tax because of a bug (and judging from H&R Block's support website, this is a bug that appears in many places). Their solution was very consistent: print your return and mail it. So much for e-filing. There were several places where the software asked me to pick a number from a table, or decide which form to use. Isn't that what the software is supposed to do? It gives ""error-check"" warnings where there is no apparent problem (at least I hope there isn't; neither the Help or the error itself gave much of a clue). And there were several places where both the interface and the Help provide muddy and unclear instructions. TaxCut ended up wasting a lot of my time, turning a fairly straightforward return into an ordeal. As much as I loathe Intuit, I'm afraid that, for FY2005, I'm going to have to once again grit my teeth, curse under my breath, and pay too much for the greater confidence, fewer bugs, and smoother experience of TurboTax.

First, As you're going through the input process, after you click ""Next"" on any of the screens, there's not an hourglass, progress bar, or anything else to tell you that you are waiting (and I mean REALLY waiting) on the program. This could lead you to think you didn't really click the ""Next"" button.  If you click it again, then you've jumped two screens ahead and have to go back.
Second, I used Tax Cut last year without any problems, so I imported last year's data as the program suggests, only to find out during the final check that some of the fields don't quite match last year's format.  I got a ""Tax Cut Exception Field 9 Is Not Numeric"" error. No explanation of what Field 9 is or where to go to correct it!! Clicking OK on this error shuts down the program completely. Trying to restart and load the existing tax file resulted in a C++ error that also shut down the program. I called Tech Support (a long distance call) and after a 20 minute hold time I talked to Marquetta who had absolutely no idea what I was talking about, or what to do about it.  She had me reinstall the State version to no avail. This young lady barely had a grasp of the English language and should not be working in Tech support for anyone.

So I thought I would go back to TaxCut and give it a try again.
BIG MISTAKE!
Tax Cut will not load properly if you have a home network, cable modem, or virus software. I found this out after completing my entire tax form and attempting to e-file my return. For some reason the program had changed all of my address and zip code information erroneously. After giving tech support way too much personal data they suggested I totally uninstall the product, disconnect my network, unplug my modem, turn off my virus software and dial in via modem.... then re-type my entire return in again. Did that and then could not e-file. After two more calls to support it was determined that TaxCut could not complete an e-filing successfully.

If you have moved from one state to another, yet have W2's to file from the first state, Tax Cut changes your residence state to the state of the employer on your first W2.  If you change the residence state back, it changes the employer's state.  Their Technical Support was unaware of this problem and were unable to help solve it.  I finally fixed it by listing as the first W2 one from an employer in my state of current residence.
To make matters worse, I bought the State program.  If you don't do the above fix -- still unknown to Tax Cut -- the program won't recognize that your W2's show you paid any taxes in the state of prior residence.
The final strike came when I discovered Tax Cut State will not allow me to file electronically with my state of prior residence.  I can only do it with my state of current residence.  Again, I called their Technical Support.  I was told that's the way the software is designed.  When I pleaded that they neglected to include this information in the software ads and packaging, it was explained to me that the readme file included this information, as if that should have informed me of the restriction before I bought the software.

Since H&R Block is always offering advice I would like to take some time to offer them some.

1) You should stay out of the electronic/online tax service.  I have used your online browser in the past to file taxes and was unable to complete my taxes after spending 2 hours filling in forms with information only to find out that a form I needed was not available online.  Then this weekend I spent another 2 hours doing my Federal taxes, using your TaxCut software, and at the end I could not E-File because of an error message about ""Cannot find server_socket_windows"" or something like that.  That was with my Cable modem.  Then I tried a dial up ISP and got the same error message.  Then I called your tech support (used that phrase losely), and was informed it was ""probably"" my computer that was the problem and thanked me for calling.  Lot of help that was.  Final solution was to print out my tax return and mail them.  Gee, why did I not just do that in the first place and forget about paying for your software?
2) Even your computer information that I had to fill out above did not have Windows XP as an option for OS's.  How long has XP been out?
3) I was not happy with Intuit putting ""spyware"" on my computer so I tried your software thinking it would have some privacy.  After this ""second"" attempt at using online H&R Block products you can bet that I will ""NEVER"" be back.
Not that one unhappy customer makes a difference to you but you can bet that I will share my experiences with my friends.

product was to Turbotax, I decided to give it a try. I've

with it. My first surprise was when I downloaded the

annoyed by being referred to USGovt publications which,
of course, I didn't have lying around.
The interface between the questionnaire and the actual
forms was tricky to access.  There was not enough room to
list all my charitable contributions.

dot matrix printer and got two strips of type: about
1 inch wide on the left side and 2-1/2 inches wide
on the other.  The middle had a few stray empty boxes in
it.  It did not look very fileable.

I have not used the 2004, but I just quit working on the 2002 edition.  I got halfway through my return (20 hours work) and I finally quit.  The numbers were incorrect, but I did not notice until the last few entries.

I have rental properties and, even though I entered the information where it belonged, it somehow got transferred elsewhere.  All of my real estate taxes got moved from where they belonged to form A.  Entering the information directly onto the tax forms required me to override every single step (3 mouse clicks, I think?).  Also, I was not able to go to help and figure out what my standard mileage cost was, so it took me considerable time to go through their mileage dialogue boxes when all I wanted was standard mileage.

I had used Turbo Tax in previous years and was not unhappy with them; however, I had heard that Turbo Tax put spyware on the computer, and that it was difficult to install on more than one computer, so I decided to opt for a change.  TaxCut was cheaper, and I figured there would really be no difference (I used Parson's tax software years ago and liked them until they stopped making that program).  Anyway, at least for year 2002, TaxCut is much worse than Turbo Tax and Parson's old tax program.

2419,1,H&R Block,34.0,"04 15, 2003","I'm always hesitant to write these reviews on products I don't like.  Not that the reviews aren't worthwhile - I'm just fairly unmotivated when it comes to this sort of thing.  But TaxCut was such a dismal piece of software that I just had to tell other interested folks about my experience.  I purchased TaxCut because I wanted to ""take a stand"" on the TurboTax locked-license issue (read the TT reviews for more info).  After this experience, though, I am *very* glad that the Quicken folks have stated they won't lock next year's TT!  Otherwise, I would've had to resorted to doing my taxes by hand.  For me, TaxCut was that bad - I would've saved more time and frustration by doing my taxes by hand.
I used TaxCut for both my wife's and my individual taxes (we filed separately).  We filed both Federal and California taxes.  My wife worked for a company for the entire year, and I worked for a small company for about  of the year, and then contracted for  of year.  My wife and I are both computer folk--I'm a Windows software engineer, and she's an NT/Unix SysAdmin--so we know our way around computers & software.  Regardless, TaxCut caused me all sorts of grief.  Here's a list of the problems I ran into whilst using TaxCut:
-  Though I have a full-time broadband connection, TaxCut couldn't find the network.  This meant that I couldn't do online updates (I had to download & install them manually)  *and* I couldn't file my taxes online (hence I couldn't take advantage of TaxCut's online-filing rebate).  TaxCut's technical support was worthless at helping me solve this problem - though admittedly I didn't spend too much time working on this problem, and just resigned myself to paper-filing.
-  The software reported incorrect results for my wife's California return!  It was reporting that her refund was going to be every penny she paid in state taxes (~$6K), rather than owing $133, which turned out to be her real state tax liability.  Oddly, though, when I reviewed her internally-generated state tax form (using the ""view Form"" feature), it showed the correct (owe $133) value - somehow TaxCut's left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing!  This was problematic, because even though the form was correct, the ""interview"" wizard still acted as though I was going to get a refund - and I have no idea what sort of deduction it was using for the federal taxes.  After banging my head against this problem solo for quite a while, then going round-and-round with TaxCut's horrible tech support folks (they were utterly worthless), I finally started over w/ my wife's taxes - this time, it got it right.  (Note: I *believe* the problem had something to do with me initially telling TaxCut that my wife was not a resident of California - though after seeing and fixing this problem and then reviewing all the interview questions & answers multiple times, TaxCut still couldn't figure it out.)
  - While I find TurboTax's interview process to be fairly ""engaging"" and helpful, I found TaxCut's interview to be little more than original IRS instructions.  If TurboTax was the computer simulation of your helpful tax accountant, then TaxCut is a simulation of an IRS government worker: not very helpful, clear, or informative.
- ""Help"" is not context-sensitive.  Clicking on ""Help"" just shows you the Help table-of-contents.  TaxCut sometimes has some context-related FAQs for an interview question, but I find that there's not nearly enough when your taxes are at all tricky.  The online help is really not too much more than the IRS & state tax publications.
- Quite a few times TaxCut's interview process couldn't handle my particular tax situation, and forced me to pop its electronic version of an IRS form or worksheet, and had me fill it in by hand.  This was particularly True for self-employment-related issues: for this stuff, TaxCut really wasn't too much more than an electronic 1040 worksheet with a built-in calculator.
- I owed the government a penalty for not paying estimated taxes.  After answering the interview questions, TaxCut calculated the penalty at ~$500.  I then went back and answered the questions slightly differently (but still accurately: I just answered the, ""Would you like to use this method to calculate X?"" questions a bit differently), and it got the penalty down to ~$68!  This is the type of thing that I could usually trust TurboTax to do for me: calculate something via the two different ways, and give me the better of the two results. (If nothing else, TT usually asks better questions that more readily guide me to the best responses).
- One annoyance that kinda sums up my entire TaxCut experience: when I got to the California state interview, one of the first questions was ""will you be attaching your federal tax form to your California tax form?""  Jeez, I don't know!  By clicking on the FAQ, it tells me that I will need to include the federal form if I'll be sending in anything other than a 1040, and few Schedules it lists.  Hmm....Doesn't TaxCut know what forms I'm sending?!  I surely didn't know - it wasn't until *after* doing the state interview that you actually print your federal forms for mailing, and I couldn't figure out any easy way of discovering this information.
- TaxCut doesn't calculate 2003 tax estimates and print out the quarterly payment vouchers.  This very much surprised me: though I've never had to pay estimated taxes until this year, I always found TurboTax to be very pro-active and fully-features w/rt estimated taxes.
All-in-all, while TurboTax for me is much more of a ""full tax solution"", TaxCut is just more of a ""helper app"".  If you use TaxCut and your taxes are at all out of the norm, expect to be reading over IRS publications and filling out the forms pretty-much by hand.",TaxCut blows

The program has many bugs, to name a few,
1. I import my last year TurboTax tax return. After that, the program somehow links the zip codes of my home address and company address together. If I manually change any one of the zip code, the other one will change together. I can only have one correct address no matter what I do. I end up just start all over without importing at all.
2. Do not use the ""Review your entries"" feature under the ""Report"" menu. I try to use it to correct an error. TaxCut crashes on me when I click the ""Interview"" button in order to get back to interview steps
3. TaxCut State for California keeps blocking my e-filing. It keeps saying that I have illegal hyphen or punctuation in either the tax payer or the spouse's name. I checked over and over again and there are neither hyphen nor punctuation in any of the names. I decides to start all over the third time and carefully re-type everything. I still can not e-file.
This is the worse year for e-filing a tax return I ever has. I am wondering why these company can not do a good QA on their product. This is just so frustrating and unbelievable.",Buggy TaxCut

Anyway, big mistake. Here were the problems.
1) The product did not transfer over data related to Alternative Minimum Tax from TurboTax - meaning that Alternative Minimum Tax Credit was not calculated.  Tech Support response - start over and don't use TurboTax import.
2) I finally got TaxCut to recognize my AMT credit.  But it kept ""forgetting"" it. If I touched a field, the 1040 would include the credit.  But next time I loaded TaxCut it was gone.
3) I tried to e-file and the program crashed.  Tech support says to start over. A real hassle given the amount of data I had entered. Now I will have to paper file.
4) In general - does not feel as solid and reliable as TurboTax.

2.  The auto-update locked up when I tried to run it twice.
3.  The non-auto update file locked up during installation the first time I ran it.
4.  TaxCut Deluxe keeps giving errors trying to import my TurboTax file.  It took me 20 minutes to get the TaxCut customer support guy to understand the issue.  He was very insulting, kept interrupting and kept trying to give me advice that did not apply.  FINALLY he asked a supervisor and gave me a very non-detailed suggestion involving going back into TurboTax and re-saving the file after hitting radio button 1 (which he couldn't tell me anything else about except that it is radio button 1!).
5.  (minor) The program makes me save my tax info before doing anything even though I haven't put a single thing into it yet.
6.  They would not give me tech support without giving them all sorts of personal information (they even asked for my internet provider!).

Tax Cut will not load properly if you have a home network, cable modem, or virus software. I found this out after completing my entire tax form and attempting to e-file my return. For some reason the program had changed all of my address and zip code information erroneously. After giving tech support way too much personal data they suggested I totally uninstall the product, disconnect my network, unplug my modem, turn off my virus software and dial in via modem.... then re-type my entire return in again. Did that and then could not e-file. After two more calls to support it was determined that TaxCut could not complete an e-filing successfully.

If you have moved from one state to another, yet have W2's to file from the first state, Tax Cut changes your residence state to the state of the employer on your first W2.  If you change the residence state back, it changes the employer's state.  Their Technical Support was unaware of this problem and were unable to help solve it.  I finally fixed it by listing as the first W2 one from an employer in my state of current residence.
To make matters worse, I bought the State program.  If you don't do the above fix -- still unknown to Tax Cut -- the program won't recognize that your W2's show you paid any taxes in the state of prior residence.
The final strike came when I discovered Tax Cut State will not allow me to file electronically with my state of prior residence.  I can only do it with my state of current residence.  Again, I called their Technical Support.  I was told that's the way the software is designed.  When I pleaded that they neglected to include this information in the software ads and packaging, it was explained to me that the readme file included this information, as if that should have informed me of the restriction before I bought the software.

Since H&R Block is always offering advice I would like to take some time to offer them some.

1) You should stay out of the electronic/online tax service.  I have used your online browser in the past to file taxes and was unable to complete my taxes after spending 2 hours filling in forms with information only to find out that a form I needed was not available online.  Then this weekend I spent another 2 hours doing my Federal taxes, using your TaxCut software, and at the end I could not E-File because of an error message about ""Cannot find server_socket_windows"" or something like that.  That was with my Cable modem.  Then I tried a dial up ISP and got the same error message.  Then I called your tech support (used that phrase losely), and was informed it was ""probably"" my computer that was the problem and thanked me for calling.  Lot of help that was.  Final solution was to print out my tax return and mail them.  Gee, why did I not just do that in the first place and forget about paying for your software?
2) Even your computer information that I had to fill out above did not have Windows XP as an option for OS's.  How long has XP been out?
3) I was not happy with Intuit putting ""spyware"" on my computer so I tried your software thinking it would have some privacy.  After this ""second"" attempt at using online H&R Block products you can bet that I will ""NEVER"" be back.

forms was tricky to access.  There was not enough room to
list all my charitable contributions.

I have not used the 2004, but I just quit working on the 2002 edition.  I got halfway through my return (20 hours work) and I finally quit.  The numbers were incorrect, but I did not notice until the last few entries.

I have rental properties and, even though I entered the information where it belonged, it somehow got transferred elsewhere.  All of my real estate taxes got moved from where they belonged to form A.  Entering the information directly onto the tax forms required me to override every single step (3 mouse clicks, I think?).  Also, I was not able to go to help and figure out what my standard mileage cost was, so it took me considerable time to go through their mileage dialogue boxes when all I wanted was standard mileage.

I had used Turbo Tax in previous years and was not unhappy with them; however, I had heard that Turbo Tax put spyware on the computer, and that it was difficult to install on more than one computer, so I decided to opt for a change.  TaxCut was cheaper, and I figured there would really be no difference (I used Parson's tax software years ago and liked them until they stopped making that program).

Not that the reviews aren't worthwhile - I'm just fairly unmotivated when it comes to this sort of thing.  But TaxCut was such a dismal piece of software that I just had to tell other interested folks about my experience.  I purchased TaxCut because I wanted to ""take a stand"" on the TurboTax locked-license issue (read the TT reviews for more info).  After this experience, though, I am *very* glad that the Quicken folks have stated they won't lock next year's TT!  Otherwise, I would've had to resorted to doing my taxes by hand.  For me, TaxCut was that bad - I would've saved more time and frustration by doing my taxes by hand.
I used TaxCut for both my wife's and my individual taxes (we filed separately).  We filed both Federal and California taxes.  My wife worked for a company for the entire year, and I worked for a small company for about  of the year, and then contracted for  of year.  My wife and I are both computer folk--I'm a Windows software engineer, and she's an NT/Unix SysAdmin--so we know our way around computers & software.  Regardless, TaxCut caused me all sorts of grief.  Here's a list of the problems I ran into whilst using TaxCut:
-  Though I have a full-time broadband connection, TaxCut couldn't find the network.  This meant that I couldn't do online updates (I had to download & install them manually)  *and* I couldn't file my taxes online (hence I couldn't take advantage of TaxCut's online-filing rebate).  TaxCut's technical support was worthless at helping me solve this problem - though admittedly I didn't spend too much time working on this problem, and just resigned myself to paper-filing.
-  The software reported incorrect results for my wife's California return!  It was reporting that her refund was going to be every penny she paid in state taxes (~$6K), rather than owing $133, which turned out to be her real state tax liability.  Oddly, though, when I reviewed her internally-generated state tax form (using the ""view Form"" feature), it showed the correct (owe $133) value - somehow TaxCut's left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing!  This was problematic, because even though the form was correct, the ""interview"" wizard still acted as though I was going to get a refund - and I have no idea what sort of deduction it was using for the federal taxes.  After banging my head against this problem solo for quite a while, then going round-and-round with TaxCut's horrible tech support folks (they were utterly worthless), I finally started over w/ my wife's taxes - this time, it got it right.  (Note: I *believe* the problem had something to do with me initially telling TaxCut that my wife was not a resident of California - though after seeing and fixing this problem and then reviewing all the interview questions & answers multiple times, TaxCut still couldn't figure it out.)
  - While I find TurboTax's interview process to be fairly ""engaging"" and helpful, I found TaxCut's interview to be little more than original IRS instructions.  If TurboTax was the computer simulation of your helpful tax accountant, then TaxCut is a simulation of an IRS government worker: not very helpful, clear, or informative.
- ""Help"" is not context-sensitive.  Clicking on ""Help"" just shows you the Help table-of-contents.  TaxCut sometimes has some context-related FAQs for an interview question, but I find that there's not nearly enough when your taxes are at all tricky.  The online help is really not too much more than the IRS & state tax publications.
- Quite a few times TaxCut's interview process couldn't handle my particular tax situation, and forced me to pop its electronic version of an IRS form or worksheet, and had me fill it in by hand.  This was particularly True for self-employment-related issues: for this stuff, TaxCut really wasn't too much more than an electronic 1040 worksheet with a built-in calculator.
- I owed the government a penalty for not paying estimated taxes.  After answering the interview questions, TaxCut calculated the penalty at ~$500.  I then went back and answered the questions slightly differently (but still accurately: I just answered the, ""Would you like to use this method to calculate X?"" questions a bit differently), and it got the penalty down to ~$68!  This is the type of thing that I could usually trust TurboTax to do for me: calculate something via the two different ways, and give me the better of the two results. (If nothing else, TT usually asks better questions that more readily guide me to the best responses).
- One annoyance that kinda sums up my entire TaxCut experience: when I got to the California state interview, one of the first questions was ""will you be attaching your federal tax form to your California tax form?""  Jeez, I don't know!  By clicking on the FAQ, it tells me that I will need to include the federal form if I'll be sending in anything other than a 1040, and few Schedules it lists.  Hmm....Doesn't TaxCut know what forms I'm sending?!  I surely didn't know - it wasn't until *after* doing the state interview that you actually print your federal forms for mailing, and I couldn't figure out any easy way of discovering this information.
- TaxCut doesn't calculate 2003 tax estimates and print out the quarterly payment vouchers.  This very much surprised me: though I've never had to pay estimated taxes until this year, I always found TurboTax to be very pro-active and fully-features w/rt estimated taxes.
All-in-all, while TurboTax for me is much more of a ""full tax solution"", TaxCut is just more of a ""helper app"".  If you use TaxCut and your taxes are at all out of the norm, expect to be reading over IRS publications and filling out the forms pretty-much by hand.",TaxCut blows

It was impossible to be certain that the program was correctly calculating our 1099 forms--it came up with a wide variety of reported income figures. The amount of refund/tax owed fluctuated by 300%. The final total, after going through an error-check process that is like something from a medieval torture chamber, was FIVE TIMES the amount of tax that we paid last year--even though our income was roughly the same and our deductible expenses higher.

The Bad: Now I know why it's cheaper. TaxCut is a mere advertisement for H&R Block. The program does its best to confuse the user into giving up and driving to the local office for human filing help. TaxCut's web-based ""Help"" system will run you around in aimless circles. The so-called automatic update asks for permission to connect to the Internet, even though that's how the Help works the entire time. If it finds an update, the program claims that it will handle everything. Not True, it simply dumps you on their web site where it doesn't even show you which files you should download and manually install. Skipped an interview question accidentally? Don't try the Back button, because half the time it will skip back an entire section instead of that last page. You get to start over! What about that one year head-start in OS X?

The Ugly (as of April 13): Pop-up menus in the interview questions look empty until you pop them open. After you make a selection, it doesn't show anymore, as the size goes back to zero. After you complete a section (i.e. 1099-MISC worksheet) and come back to its directory, sometimes the item you just created will display and sometimes it won't.

2463,1,H&R Block,40.5,"02 18, 2003","I've been a Mac user since 1989 and this is the single worst piece of software I've ever purchased.  It's so bad I'm going to spend 30 minutes of my life telling you why, so you don't make the mistake of buying it.
1) After installing off the CD, I started it up. The very first thing it told me was to go download an update. This sounded great, I was psyched they were so on top of things, so I clicked on the link, went to their page and downloaded the update. After downloading the update I was a little bit leery, because the instructions on the page didn't match what was actually downloaded (there was no ""Update B"" option), but I went ahead and followed the rest of the directions for updating. Restarted, etc, and discovered that now the program simply crashed on startup (""Unknown Error Type 3""). Happened every time, tried reinstalling off CD, redownloading update, same result. I finally decided to simply proceed with the version off the CD and hope the update wasn't critical to my needs.
2) Starting afresh, I got to work. For while, things were pretty straightforward and OK. Then I got to the ""Capital Gains & Losses"" section, where I engaged the Capital Gains Assistant. The first question deals with ""Average Basis Method"". Since I don't know what that means, I figured I'd click on the link that would presumably explain it to me. Program crashed instantly. Restarted, tried again, same result. Restarted, thought maybe that one link is bad, clicked on ""Help"" in the yellow sidebar. Program crashed. Restarted, clicked on ""Ask A Tax Advisor"". Program crashed. Restarted, clicked on Search and was prompted for topic. However, (A) there's apparently no entry for ""average basis method"" and (B), no matter what else I enter, the second I click on ""Go There"" to see what it has to say... program crashes! So basically, the main reason I bought the software-it's alleged ability to explain unfamiliar terms and procedures-absolutely does not work!
At this point, I sent an email to their tech support outlining all of this. Got an automated reply saying I'd get help within 48 hours. More on that farce later.
3) In the meantime, after lots of gnashing of teeth. I did some research on the IRS site, figured out what I needed to know and forged ahead. At the same time, I figured I'd download the state add-on I needed (California). Since they claimed the state stuff would be available for download by Jan 31, I naively assumed that since it was Feb. 7, that I would be able to do so. Ha! No way, not until a few days after that was the Mac version available. Paid for it, downloaded it, and guess what? The installer doesn't work! The download went fine, but when I try to run the installer I get the message: ""An error occurred while reading the installation data. This installer appears to be damaged."" I tried shutting everything down, restarting, and running the installer and got the same error message. I tried redownloading the installer and got the same message. Go to their site to report this (now that I know where the form is!), fill out the form, and now the submit button to send the tech support form doesn't work!!! Been trying it off and on for three hours. All while doing all kinds of other web surfing, emailing, etc. Unreal.
4) Meanwhile, the 48 hours since my tech support request went out has come and gone. I reread their auto response email and see that ""If you do not receive a response in the allotted time, please contact our TaxCut Technical Support Team at [...]"" So, what they're saying is, if we don't respond in the time we say we will, you need to go to this page, and fill out a long form restating your question! Oh, and the grandest irony of that foolishness is that the link they give you to ""Submit Your Question"" doesn't work!!! You get dumped onto their homepage and have to go hunt for the page they meant to send you to! Welcome to HTML for seven-year-olds... Finally, 72 hours (almost to the minute!) after I sent my initial email, I get an email from their tech support. It's a stock response, totally ignoring my specific problems, which outlines the  ""Macintosh minimum system requirements"" to run the program and simply signs off by saying, ""If you have any further questions or concerns, please reply  to this e-mail."" Well, I actually did read the system requirements before I bought the program, but thanks for sharing them again.... So, I replied and suppose it'll be another 72 hours before I hear back.

2464,1,H&R Block,40.5,"02 15, 2003","I'm sorry to say this people, but TaxCut for Mac is awful to the point of being unusable. Do yourself a favor, forget it! When I first got going, I thought TaxCut was going to be OK... different from TurboTax -and in some ways simpler. But TaxCut turns out to be the buggiest software I have ever used, bar none!  I could sit here for an hour and discuss the long list of serious problems with it, including totally crazy calculations in the capital gains section. It even froze up twice on my normally crashless G3/500 w/ OS 9.2.2 losing 5 hours of entries. The final glitch was that it won't even let me e-file the bogus return it cooked up because the software updater, which actually works OK (if you have high-speed to get the 15 MB updater) did not satisfy the final error checker. I have already wasted 4 days, totally aghast at how crappy this software is, and am going back to TurboTax which at least worked for me for the last 3 years. I have to! TaxCut is totally unreliable and I wouldn't dare even try to file the wacky return it came up with. I don't think Uncle Sam would appreciate it.",Will try to get my money back.
2465,1,H&R Block,40.5,"04 14, 2003","It would have been easier to prepare taxes by hand. The program created duplicate, triplicate and in some cases sextuplicate form entries.
The results of using the ""delete form"" option are not visible until you close all the screens and reopen them. After that, the Review Last Year option is useless because the forms appear to be cross-linked.
It was impossible to be certain that the program was correctly calculating our 1099 forms--it came up with a wide variety of reported income figures. The amount of refund/tax owed fluctuated by 300%. The final total, after going through an error-check process that is like something from a medieval torture chamber, was FIVE TIMES the amount of tax that we paid last year--even though our income was roughly the same and our deductible expenses higher.
The last thing I did before giving up was to re-examine the checklist (not an intuitive task by any means) only to find that TaxCut had duplicated one of the Schedule C forms THREE TIMES.
Don't even get me started on the problems with downloading the update...",Taxes are 90% Easier without TaxCut!
2466,1,H&R Block,40.5,"04 13, 2003","The Good: TaxCut is less expensive than TurboTax and was first to OS X last year. Now it imports last year's TurboTax data!
The Bad: Now I know why it's cheaper. TaxCut is a mere advertisement for H&R Block. The program does its best to confuse the user into giving up and driving to the local office for human filing help. TaxCut's web-based ""Help"" system will run you around in aimless circles. The so-called automatic update asks for permission to connect to the Internet, even though that's how the Help works the entire time. If it finds an update, the program claims that it will handle everything. Not True, it simply dumps you on their web site where it doesn't even show you which files you should download and manually install. Skipped an interview question accidentally? Don't try the Back button, because half the time it will skip back an entire section instead of that last page. You get to start over! What about that one year head-start in OS X? I guess it wasn't long enough to pop the lid on Cocoa so we could use a mouse with a scroll wheel.
The Ugly (as of April 13): Pop-up menus in the interview questions look empty until you pop them open. After you make a selection, it doesn't show anymore, as the size goes back to zero. After you complete a section (i.e. 1099-MISC worksheet) and come back to its directory, sometimes the item you just created will display and sometimes it won't. And I hope you didn't change your mind about that single item you decided to add in an Itemize list yesterday.

1) It filled out a 540X for me, indicating an amended return.  I gave it no information that would indicate an amended return.  I had to delete the form to get it to file correctly.
2) It filled out several other forms, such as ""Teacher Credit"", ""Child and Dependent Credit"", despite me answering ""NO"" to questions regarding these credits.  I had to delete these forms as well.
3) It demanded that I fill out my child's name on Form 3803, even though I don't have a child and didn't say that I did.
4) It wanted me to fill out form 3801, Passive Activity Loss, but gave me no information on how to do so.  It filled out the Federal Return just fine, but didn't carry information over correctly.

In that case, the 1099-MISC must be deleted or redirected to another form.""  That's the extent of it - I have no idea how to ""redirect"" a 1099-MISC.  I didn't even have any 1099-MISC's anyways.

I was very happy with the 2002 version and everything went very well - just as well as TurboTax in previous years.  However, this year TaxCut state for CA did several things that make me feel uncertain about the accuracy of my return:
1) It filled out a 540X for me, indicating an amended return.  I gave it no information that would indicate an amended return.  I had to delete the form to get it to file correctly.
2) It filled out several other forms, such as ""Teacher Credit"", ""Child and Dependent Credit"", despite me answering ""NO"" to questions regarding these credits.  I had to delete these forms as well.
3) It demanded that I fill out my child's name on Form 3803, even though I don't have a child and didn't say that I did.
4) It wanted me to fill out form 3801, Passive Activity Loss, but gave me no information on how to do so.  It filled out the Federal Return just fine, but didn't carry information over correctly.

2522,1,H&R Block,40.5,"08 14, 2005","My mother worked for H&R Block for many years, so I have no personal problem with them.

I have not used the 2004, but I just quit working on the 2002 edition.  I got halfway through my return (20 hours work) and I finally quit.  The numbers were incorrect, but I did not notice until the last few entries.

I have rental properties and, even though I entered the information where it belonged, it somehow got transferred elsewhere.  All of my real estate taxes got moved from where they belonged to form A.  Entering the information directly onto the tax forms required me to override every single step (3 mouse clicks, I think?).  Also, I was not able to go to help and figure out what my standard mileage cost was, so it took me considerable time to go through their mileage dialogue boxes when all I wanted was standard mileage.

I had used Turbo Tax in previous years and was not unhappy with them; however, I had heard that Turbo Tax put spyware on the computer, and that it was difficult to install on more than one computer, so I decided to opt for a change.  TaxCut was cheaper, and I figured there would really be no difference (I used Parson's tax software years ago and liked them until they stopped making that program).  Anyway, at least for year 2002, TaxCut is much worse than Turbo Tax and Parson's old tax program.  The big problem is, it puts information in the wrong place; and I have been doing my own taxes for 20 years, so it is not a mistake which I am making.

I downloaded TaxAct just a moment ago; it is cheaper than either turbo tax or taxcut, and so far, it behaves just like it is supposed to.  I have been entering some info by their prompts and other info directingly onto the tax forms, and, except for the fact that the auto-save requires me to hit the hardreturn every time, other than that, I really like TaxAct. It is functioning exactly how it is supposed to.  Furthermore, I have entered in a couple of properties and printed it out, and everything is going where it belongs.",very disappointing
2523,1,H&R Block,40.5,"04 13, 2005","I wrote a nice long review but as it happens my computer shut down before the review was submitted. However, I'm going to do it again here because I don't want you to waste your time like I wasted mine on this software this year, my first year doing my own taxes.

My main beefs --

- Rebate process was probably more annoying than if I had read the IRS detailed tax instructions.

- DeductionPro is useless; didn't even install it since I just took the standard deduction they give you instead of itemizing.

- Videos are annoying; you can't fast forward or rewind. I also felt like I was being talked down to or needlessly being sold on the software I had already purchased (""alternative minimum tax is way complicated, but don't worry, we'll help you out!"")

- Useless questions that could be automated away. For example, why do I need to tell the software what 1040 form I want to use? Isn't that the point of the software?

- Lack of question explanation in the text. For example, how am I supposed to figure out if I have Hope or lifetime learning or deduction credit? If I wanted to look at detailed documentation or find an online reference, I wouldn't have bought the software.

- Ads of the H&R Block tax advisor service and all the other extra junk they try to sell you. Ask yourself, what's their incentive for making the questions and question flow clear if their intention is to sell you on the extras if you're confused.

And the straw that broke the camel's back and led me to another  online service (free and better!) --

- Huge bug where it deducted my Roth IRA contribution. I didn't know much about the tax system but one of the things I did know is that Roth IRA contributions are not tax deductible. I considered filing an official complaint against the software, but am sick of dealing with it so this review will have to do.

About the only thing that didn't make the software completely worthless was that I did my state tax return with it. The online service I used for federal didn't have the part-year resident form I needed for my state. Even then I made sure to double check the numbers it spewed out since I had lost trust in the software's accuracy.

I had thought that the H&R Block name would've been an advantage in accuracy, etc. But really, I feel like the software's existence is to make people migrate toward their brick-and-mortar professionals. Also, it's no wonder the software has bugs if the IRS forms themselves were not yet finalized when the software was released (an online update of the software is required). Although, to be fair, the accuracy problems I entered both upped my refund; at the risk of getting audited!

Bottom Line:

If you're really lazy -- pay a tax professional or bribe a knowledgeable friend.

If you're medium lazy -- go with an online service or the other popular software package

If you're willing to spend time learning about taxes (for future benefit e.g. to optimize refunds, catch software mistakes) -- go directly to the IRS instructions and consider doing double checking and e-filing with an online service.",cut out this software -- find something else!
2524,1,H&R Block,40.5,"02 4, 2005","I purchased the Premium version of TaxCut for $39.99, and I would not employ the term satisfactory, let alone Premium, (and I'm a Software Engineer).  One can't imagine what ""Premium"" features could possibly be missing from a ""Deluxe"" or ""Basic"" version, and still provide you with an accurate tax return.

I've typically filed my taxes with H&R Block's incredibly user friendly online service, but I saw this while in line at Best Buy (kudos to whomever strategically placed those TaxCut kiosks) and thought it might more thoroughly assist with deductions and credits available to homeowners.  Unfortunately, to get into detailed deductions you need to purchase the H&R Block TaxCut Deduction Pro for another $19.99.  Doubly unfortunate is the software's uselessness.  Deduction Pro's only functions are a) a spreadsheet where one might track contributions made to charity (a service a pen and piece of paper could perform equally as well);  and, b) to find out what the exact tax value is of those sneakers you donated to the Salvation Army or those magazines you donated to the library.  What most people do not realize is that you need to contribute several thousand dollars to charity or have several thousand dollars in medical expenses before these are tax deductible, and people who fall into these categories more often than not are having their taxes prepared by an accountant.  For the rest of use, Deduction ""Pro"" will advise you to take the Standard Deduction, rendering the program a waste of time and money.

TaxCut ""Premium"" does not include state tax software either-- you need to purchase TaxCut State separately for $24.99.  Because I work in New York and live in Connecticut, I needed to file state taxes in both states.  Unfortunately, the $24.99 only affords you access to one state of your choosing.  People like myself need to pay another $24.99 for the second state (and second TaxCut State purchase is not rebatable).

Then of course, there is the convenience of E-filing, for which TaxCut charges $15.95: $15.95 for Federal and another $15.95 for State.  E-filing is definitely worth it, so I coughed up the surcharge.  Unfortunately, I could not E-file my New York state return because TaxCut will not permit you to E-file Partial Year or Nonresident returns, which means you need to print everything (printing a simply copy of your completed return is another area of the program that proves less than simple) and mail it in yourself with all supporting documents.

Here's the kicker, folks.  After spending over $116 on poorly executed, user-UNfriendly, and in a few instances, inaccurate TaxCut software and e-filing, when TaxCut repeatedly gave me an error message and refused to open my file, I was forced to call Customer Support for which they charge $9.95 per call, not for tax advise, but for tech support when their software runs amuck!!  If you surf around the TaxCut website long enough, you eventually discover there is a free number.  When I phoned the ""free"" number (not toll-free, just free from credit card charges), I was on hold for 29 minutes before I was able to speak to a customer support agent.  I explained my tech problem and was then placed on hold for another 8 minutes while he discussed with his senior tech supervisor what the problem could be.  Ultimately the problem could not be resolved, and Mr. TaxCut's resolution was that I uninstall and reinstall the three software programs.

The bugs and annoyances with the software make it non-functional in many respects and a waste of time to try to correct. I'll try to enumerate my qualms below, which should tell my story:

1. The software is incomplete out of the box. You won't be able to complete your return until after you download updates (it appears they were in a rush to get the software to market before tax time and the product's completion).

2. The option to update is on what seems like every other screen, and the fact that you have to choose ""update later"" to move on (even after you just updated) makes the user interface pretty clunky and counter-intuitive. This may be a minor gripe, but it all adds up.

3. You are hounded several times throughout the process to upgrade or buy extra services. Why does software I purchase try to sell me more software?!?

4. One of the up-sells is actually the opportunity to e-file (which you can do for free elsewhere). The federal and state e-file cost you $15 apiece, so be ready to fork out another $30 on top of the purchase price, or print your forms and snail mail them.

5. The forms don't actually print correctly if you want to mail them. There are missing sections of single pages on both the federal and state forms which means you either have to give H&R Block another $30 to e-file as a reward for their buggy software, or seek tech support.

6. Tech support may as well not exist. I called 4 times total, usually hanging up because of hold times. On my forth call, I decided to wait it out and discovered that they had me wait on hold for literally an hour before someone answered. Their timing was pretty perfect, though, because the hold time was just long enough for my cordless phone to run out of battery power and hang up, leaving me without a solution to my problem, and little desire to wait on hold again.

2549,1,H&R Block,90.99,"04 1, 2006","I got this software hoping to find some deductions I didn't know I had earned, or at least that I would save some time doing my taxes.  In the end, this software come up with exactly the same numbers I would have gotten doing it myself, and it actually took longer to do my taxes, thanks to a number of functional problems in the software:

* It calculated my tax WRONG!!  It made an error looking up my income in the tax tables and was $25 off estimating my tax.  Here's the most fundamental function of the software and it gets it wrong (even after the required software update).  The one good thing I can say about this is that it did let me override the number on the form.  This prevented me from filing electronically, but it did let me print the form, which saved me the trouble of having to do it all by hand after having done it on the computer.

* Out of the box, the software did not work, and required a hotfix update.  This is not unusual for commercial software, and tax laws change frequently, so I am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.  However, the hotfix feature did not work either, it repeatedly failed to get and install the hotfix, so I had to go to their website, find, download, and install the update file.

* The user interface is a counterintuitive hybrid of a wizard that asks a bazillion questions in the top-half of the screen, and the tax forms on the bottom half of the screen.  The wizard is where you actually entered the information.  As long as you went though it sequentially, it worked reasonably well, but God help you if you ever had to go back and add a deduction you forgot about, or tweak some other value.  The navigation buttons don't always take you where you thought you would go, and on several occasions, I found myself going in circles.

* At one point, I wanted to view the 1040 form, to see how a change I had made would affect a specific entry.  Well, that should be the bottom half of the screen.  Right?  No.  Sometimes it is, but most times it displays whatever schedule the top half of the user interface pertains to.  I hunted around for 10 minutes before I got what I was looking for (it's available on a pull-down menu).

* The DeductionPro software that comes with TaxCut is even more worthless than TaxCut.  It was supposedly free, sometimes you really do get what you pay for.

* H&R Block supposedly offers a money back guarantee on this software, but the fine print says, ""...we'll refund the purchase price, less shipping, handling, sales tax and any rebate you receive on the software.""  Considering they gave you MS Money in the deal, I'm guessing you'll end up with next to nothing back if you do ask for a refund, Im going to try anyway.",Worthless!  One star is too many.
2550,1,H&R Block,90.99,"03 31, 2006","There was a bug in the Maryland interview questions for partial-resident returns.  Even if you entered in that you were only a Maryland resident for the beginning part of the year, it prompted you to specify which MARYLAND county you lived in on 12/31/2006. In the end, you just had to put in the county you lived in regardless of whether or not you were still living there at the end of the year.

How did I figure this out? I played around with my answers, printed out the resulting forms, waded through all the paper, and through experimentation figured out the answer.

Before doing this, I tried to call customer service.  The first time, after being rerouted and put back into queue 3 times and hung up on once, I finally made contact and was told that my case was being escalated. I was given a case number and was told that I would be contacted in 48 business hours.  Two weeks later, no reply, no messages, nothing.  I tried calling again, and I was again rerouted and spoke with TWO representatives that were clueless about what a case number was; each time I had to re-explain my case.  I was finally transfered to a ""senior technical representative"" who basically said he would call me back because when I attempted to open up my tax return, I received an exception error pop-up that I never saw before and it required me reinstall my state software.  I left work early to be home when he was supposed to call two days later... only he never called.  I waited and then I called twice, and two lower representatives both told me that they would have the senior rep call me back.  Only, I never got a call back.  The final call I made was at 8pm central time... only I got a recorded message this time telling me to call back at their normal business hours... which was until 10pm central time.  A few days later I received an email, with no reply address, stating that I needed to update my state software... which was not the case because I already had and when I attempted to again, I was informed through the program that no more updates were available.

After getting fed up with the phone calls, I waited a day to cool off and tried the online help through their website.  This was no good either... As I was trying to explain my bug with the Maryland state interview questions, I was told that, ""My apologies, but TaxCut has no bugs.""  The representative then disregarded my issue, instead repeatedly giving me instructions on how to efile my state returns (which was not my issue at all and I was clueless as to why she kept trying to explain this).  I then asked a question about a federal worksheet form that I needed to include on my other state return that was mentioned on the final checklist provided by TaxCut... again, no answer. Even if they COULD clarify which form they were referring to in their checklist, I wouldn't be able to use the taxcut forms because I efiled my federal form, and when you do that, you can't print out anything except forms that say ""not for filing"" on it... and they said I shouldn't send those in... After about 4 representatives were dropped from the conversation due to technical difficulties, and about 2 hours later, I was told to call the IRS number at 1-800-829-1040, which I could have looked up.  So, was I helped? No.  Hopefully, the IRS ppl will be able to help me.

I filed with TurboTax last year (wonderful program by the way... I filed in under 2 hours tops last year), and they allowed me to save my returns in pdf versions to print out wherever I wanted to.  Taxcut doesn't allow you to do that. I don't have a printer at home. So, what I did was install a postscript printer driver, printed to file, and opened up the postscript versions on my work computer to print them out.  This seemed pretty round about, considering that pdfs are so user-friendly.

To sum up:
- TaxCut isn't so good with partial-resident returns.
- TaxCut customer service is unhelpful and unreliable.
- TaxCut doesn't allow you to print in pdfs.
- USE TurboTax! That's what I'll be going back to next year.",No good for partial-residency.... Terrible Customer Service... No PDF options. Will use TurboTax next year.
2551,1,H&R Block,90.99,"03 29, 2006","Well, I will never buy another H&R Block product after today's experience.  TaxCut worked fine until I completed my returns.  When I came to the Filing stage, I wanted to save printer images of my tax returns to files.  I planned to move these files to another computer and print them there, in addition to saving the PDF images on the original computer.

Although TaxCut does not document a way to route the printer image to a file, rather than a printer, I researched the issue on the Internet last night and found one other person who said that TaxCut's technical support staff told them how to get a converter, whose output was a file containing a PDF image of the tax return.  Unfortunately, they didn't provide the name of the converter or how to get hold of it.

So I called TaxCut Customer Support this morning and described what I wanted to do. Twenty-five minutes later, I had no answer, but the very nice lady transferred me to ""Online Support"" and said they would be able to help me.  This turned out to be the 800 number for the Online version of TaxCut.  Wending my way through its voicemail maze, I eventually reached a recording that told me to dial the 800 number for the Software version of TaxCut for technical assistance - this was the number I had just been transferred from!

I called the original 800 number back and got a new, also very nice, lady. This time, my call was disconnected immediately after I described my issue and gave her my name.

I tried again this afternoon.  After I spent 45 minutes of unfruitful conversation with an agent, he put a supervisor, Amy, on the line.  She told me that what I wanted to do was possible, but undocumented, and that she and others in her office did it all the time - for instance, she did this on her computer at home.  But, she said, giving me the answer did not fall within the limits of her job responsibility.  She and the previous agent were not only unhelpful, but antagonistic.

I was friendly and polite to everyone until about 30 seconds after Amy had hung up on me, when I realized I was talking to a dead line.

I don't blame the individual agents for what happened; what happened is more likely a pervasive problem caused by poor management.

While searching for a solution to my problem, I've found two other things worth noting:

- TurboTax offers a specific menu selection to save the printer image to a file;

- taxes.lifetips.com offers tips for filing your taxes, ""Brought to you by TaxCut from H&R Block"", and specifically advises to ""remember to save a PDF version of your completed return to your computer hard drive"".",Terrible technical support
2552,1,H&R Block,90.99,"03 27, 2006","If you have stock options (ISO, nonqual) or employee stock purchase to report, stay away from TaxCut 2005. The Premium & State version asks you the questionnaire, but no dollar amounts. It merely gives you advice on what the tax scenario could be but does not compute the numbers. The next section after you are done entering the stock option information is one which asks you to enter 1099-B information. None of the previous information is carried forward. TaxCut relies on you to do the computation your way and enter the numbers once again. This makes me wonder, why I am spending my time and money on this software if I have to do the computation and understand the tax implications on my own.

I called up customer service - the rep did not seem to have any clue on how taxes are done. All what he did what escalated the ticket to the software development group (still waiting for their response).

Next, I called H&R block to see if they could answer. As it turns out, most H&R block representatives are hardly comfortable using the computer. They do NOT use TaxCut - instead they have a different tax software. The representative was also not aware of how data could be imported from my TaxCut into their software.

This is part III on the Schedule C.  If you follow only the interview process, you would leave this out, and if you are a retailer, this is likely your largest business expense!  What's more, if you go directly into the form and enter the info, but later go back through the interview process, it will clear out everything you entered in the COGS section so you have to fill it out again!

I contacted their customer support by email, online chat, and phone.  Over email and chat they could not understand what I was saying and kept saying ""delete the form and go through the interview again"" or ""here is how you correct an error on the form,"" as if their ""error check"" feature had picked up the missing COGS, which it had NOT.

However, when using this problem I found the wording on some of the questions a little confusing and when I asked help it basically just repeats what was said in the original question.  It was not easy to navigate back and forth through the program and when I finally completed the return and attempted to file electronically it gave me an error to fix.  My first complaint, it was a minor error that the program should have been aware of to begin with - the federal form did not allow more then ten characters in the specific area of the form.  With TurboTax this would never have even been an error because it does not use more characters than the forms allow.  Second, when I attempted to correct the error there was no way to actually fix it.  It presented the space of the form that needed correcting but it did not let you write a new entry, delete the entry, or correct the entry in anyway.  When I attempted to contact tech support for help I was on hold for over 45 minutes and than disconnected!  Granted, it is tax season and hold times are longer than normal, but the phone system should not disconnect you!  There was no help on the online help center, and the e-mail response took 48 hours.

One year, due to buggy programming it SKIPPED my entire IRA interview so I made an error on my taxes and ended up having to pay an additional $900 plus a penalty.  The HUGE amount of work required to prove this error to take advantage of the ""Guarantee"" is a joke and not worth the time.  I have learned that you can never never just rely on the interviews and that they often aren't phrased clearly enough so you don't know really where you are in the return.

Microsoft Money is fine; unlike Quicken, they've kept their promise to be able to store data online.  But TaxCut is another story.

IF YOU'VE USED THIS SOFTWARE TO PREPARE YOUR 2005 TAXES AND OWE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT, FILE AN EXTENSION, GET TURBOTAX AND RE-DO YOUR RETURNS!  YOU MAY SAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS!!!  Then ask for your money back.

I got such wildly different and dismaying results from my TaxCut prepared return in 2005 than my TurboTax return for 2004 that I called a tax attorney friend to ask if there had been any changes in the tax laws, applicable to me, that would explain the difference.  He allowed as how there were not, and suggested I use TurboTax, as he does.

The interview asked whether I were a resident.  I declared that I was not, and a dialog box popped up and informed me that, sorry, but the software did not do returns for nonresidents of that particular state.  It apologized for any inconvenience (such as the $35!)  So I went back and declared myself a part-year resident, hoping to get an idea of what I would owe.

Lynde, the author of a previous review, I was a long-term user of Intuit's It's Deductible program, but was growing increasingly tired of Intuit's arrogance towards its customers.  Their discontinuation of the desktop version and forcing of customers to use the on-line version caused me to switch to H&R Block's DeductionPro.  However, I am having serious doubts about the wisdom of that move.

Things started out well, as I was able to enter in a rather long list of items that I donated to Goodwill.  The problem came when I realized I had entered the wrong date for the donation.  When I tried to edit the date, it actually erased all the previously entered info for the donation!  Fortunately I have an automatic backup program that have saved a copy of the original, and I was able to restore it.

Problems intensified when I sent an email to tech support asking how to change the date without deleting all the data.  The first response I got told my how to switch from the 2006 version of the program to the 2005 version -- not at all what I had asked.  It is like the person on the other end only glanced at what I had written.

I responded to that email telling them that I did not want to change program years, but just change the date for a donation.  The response I got seemed to state my problem accurately, but the solution I was given was to add or delete a charity name.  There was no mechanism for editing the date there.

So I sent yet another email explaining that the solution did not work.  The responder seemed to think that I wanted to delete a charity name, and proceeded to give me the exact same advice the previous person had.  Plus the advice that if I deleted a charity to make sure and hand copy all the deduction information so I could re-enter it by hand!

I replied asking for some real help, they told me to disable my Anti-virus and Firewall software ""it should only take 5 minutes"" they said.  This is the most absurd piece of ""help"" I've ever been offered, first off; they don't even ask what AV or Firewall software I was running, secondly; do they know it's 2005, I'd no more go out into the street naked than turn off both my firewall and antivirus software.  A couple of emails later, they told me to apply for a refund!!!!!!!  Way to go guys.  Now if I could install Tax Cut while disconnected form the web, disabling my security software MIGHT be an option, but you have to be connected to the web to install!

Just got my state tax return sent back to me saying that I had failed to fill out large chunks of my tax return.  When I examined what TaxCut had filled out, it left out complete columns.  When I started to do the tax return by hand, it became clear that TaxCut failed not only fill things out, but also filled out parts of the form incorrectly.  It got the standard deduction wrong (to the tune of 2 grand).

""Customer Support"" was what I have grown to expect with companies.  Completely non-responsive.  When I had problems with the program earlier I was told that I could expect all fixes to come in the future.  The program told me that I could e-file my state tax return, but when I tried to do it, I was told that I could not.  I contacted customer support and they said I could return it for a refund IF I still had the original box and receipt (this for a program I bought in January).",Lawsuit waiting to happen

I gave it a shot this time around because it was cheaper, but found numerous bugs that have left me very nervous about submitting my taxes. Here's a HUGE one: If you live in California, you can deduct a portion of your vehicle registration fees under state and local tax. Turbotax explicitly asks you for this. Taxcut MAKES NO MENTION OF IT. If you didn't know to enter it manually (how ridiculous!), you wouldn't get this credit. And for most people, this credit will reduce their taxes (or increase their rebate) significantly-- for me it was far more than the cost of this stupid software.

I was in shock when it asked me to fill out a form for which it already should have had all the information it needed (form 8801).  I had to go to a tax consultant to make sure I had filled it out correctly, which obviously wiped out any savings from using TaxCut.  Then, AFTER I checked the entire return for errors (0 errors, 0 warnings), and AFTER I entered my credit card for online filing, it rejects my return, saying there is an error in form 8801.  The error is that it did not subtract line 38 from line 37 and put the results in line 40.  It told me to do that manually (override).  So I overrode the entry, resubmitted, and it was rejected AGAIN, saying ""you are not authorized to override that entry"".  I haven't heard back from H&R B yet, but from Diogenes's post it looks like I'll have to print out my return and then fight to get my credit card charges reversed.

I wrote most of this while on hold for TaxCut Customer Service.  I spent a little more than an hour waiting to speak to someone.  This was my second call - I waited 45 minutes before this to speak to TaxCut Technical Support.  All Technical Support did was have me reinstall the software, and when that didn't solve the problem, they gave me another number for Customer Service.

All this is over what appears to be some flawed copy protection.  I buy all my software legitimately.  I paid [...] at a local big box store for TaxCut Deluxe+State.  The huge selling feature for this package is that State is included, which is a big win over prior years' practice of requiring that you buy it, and then[...].

The software installed normally, both federal and state editions.  I only need one state so this was all pretty simple.  I imported last year's data and got through the Federal return with only a modest amount of fuss.  However, things fell apart when I got to the State return.

The screen for this lists the state programs you have installed, and the one I selected during the original installation is listed.  However, when I select that and click on the ""Begin"" button, I get a dialog box entitled ""State Program Install Key Not Valid."" This dialog goes on to ask for an Install Key and a Name, which it asserts are from an email message sent to me.

The only point during the installation that I was offered an opportunity to provide an email address was during a product registration step that popped up right after the initial install.  It's not a required field, so I have no email from TaxCut, as they have no email address for me.

So far, I have spent more time in hold queues waiting for a fix for this license key issue than I have spent on my taxes.

When I finally did reach Customer Support, they had two suggestions.  After reinstalling the software yet again to no effect, they suggested that I could either a) ask the retailer to exchange it, on the theory that H&R Block had somehow gotten the wrong disk, some sort of trial edition, in the box or b) sit through the hold queue at Tech Support again!

When I asked to speak to a Supervisor, I was told that there are none ""on the floor"" on weekends.

Like others here, my installation also stalled at 21% with the mmvdpro.swf file. I have current versions of flash and XP patches, so that is not an issue. Writing code to install software is neither original nor particularly difficult, it's one of the most basic operation software performs. No problems with other software (or earlier versions of this) regarding this issue.

That this doesn't work is very disappointing. The fact that the taxcut website doesn't offer any suggestions or support on this issue further discourages use of this software next year. This was an unnecessary waste of time.

Rebooting into safe mode to install the program seems to have worked - I hope now that it is installed I will not have any further problems.

I have used TaxCut for the last few years, next year I'll be looking for other products.

------------------

Having just used the program to fill out my taxes, I would like to add the following comments:

The user interface is poor, the fonts and forms are not well designed, nor does much of the information fit properly inside the provided spaces. If you start entering data into a form, the data entry textbox gets larger (along with the font) and overlays other parts of the form. While this doesn't prevent you from using the software, it is puzzling why this inadequate design choice was made. There is plenty of space available in the application window which is left blank. This space could have easily been used to help with the data entry forms. I did not see any options that would allow adjusting font sizes in this program.

As another example, the top row shows the Federal/State refund amounts, they don't fit inside the little textbox. (No, my refund wasn't that large!) At times the radio buttons don't work, or the window/form doesn't properly redraw.

I don't recall previous editions of this software package being this poorly implemented. I am very disappointed.

HR/TaxCut will send you a link for a survey/feedback for the product. I tried to take advantage of that opportunity to provide some useful information back to them, but the survey is as poorly designed as the product, insisting that you put an answer for every single item, even if it's not applicable to you, or you have no opinion on a given question. (this might be a screen with 20 items to check). It will not let you get past the screen. I aborted the survey not even halfway through after 10+ minutes.

2640,1,H&R Block,70.99,"03 11, 2006","I moved from TurboTax to TaxCut a few years due to Inuit's C-Dilla fiasco, vowing never to return... Having used this year's TaxCut for Business & Business State, I'm soon to be (again) a loyal TT user.

I installed the Federal program and, when directed, also installed the State program. The first piece of bad news was that I couldn't import last year's return (also prepared using TaxCut). The comments in other posts about slow, useless technical support are confirmed; 30 minutes of online chat during which I was asked exactly one pertinent question from a person who obviously knew less about the product and its features than I did. In the end, I was told that it might maybe kind-of possibly be a good guess that some form or other wasn't approved yet and, so, I should wait until mid-March to see if I still had the problem then. This was on March 11th and - as we know - corporate taxes are due on March 15th. I abandoned the attempt at further technical help and just re-entered the information.

The interview does, indeed, not keep track of it's location; very frustrating. Also, there are indeed many places (MANY places) where the TaxCut interview process is as follows: ""Here's a form. Fill it out. Don't forget the important stuff.""

When I finished the Federal return (expecting to navigate into the State interview), TaxCut was unaware that just hours earlier it had installed the State program. I had to re-download the State from their web site and after being told that I had successfully installed the State, it still wasn't available. I had to close and re-open the program to move from Federal to State. And, OBTW, re-enter a bunch of stuff that shoud have been transferred from the Federal return.

This is definitely the worst tax preparation software (and, quite possibly, the worst commercial software of any sort) I've seen. It's atrocious. I'm embarrased to have bought it and I really wish I'd have read these other reviews before having done so.",Stunningly Bad
2641,1,H&R Block,70.99,"03 4, 2006","This is a pretty bad cut-the-corners hack-job of a program. I'd give it 0 stars if that were an option.

My TaxCut business return for 2004 disappeared silently when I uninstalled the 2004 product. Did the uninstaller do it? I don't know, but I didn't delete the files manually. As a result, I can't import last year's data.

When updating the software, a dialog came up that ambiguously claimed that some forms were not available. It didn't say which ones, or suggest how I could tell.

It frequently leaves out explanations of entries on forms. At one point it claimed misleadingly that a form was not available and attempted to force me to skip the form, which was needed for asset depreciation. Guessing that the Forms menu might allow it to be downloaded, I tried to Preview and it again misleadingly claimed the form was not available. I clicked on ""Open"" and it downloaded.  After that, I had to click on ""Back"" a few times to restart the asset process.

The asset entry form is among the worst user interfaces I've ever been cursed with using. There is no excuse for something this bad to survive from the 2004 version of the TaxCut product. It would not respond to a TAB or ENTER/RETURN to go to the next field, forcing the mouse to be used repeatedly. Nor does it provide a way to import from a CSV or spreadsheet. So for anything more than a couple of lines, the costs of data entry time alone well exceed the cost to buy a competitor's software.

It doesn't automatically place you back at the last step you were at, if you interrupt the process, save, and reopen the form. This was annoying.  But when I reopened a form after interrupting the entry process, the software incorrectly began setting check boxes to YES or NO, ignoring the prior settings. That's not just annoying, its a very big risk.

Often, questions are posed in such a way as to make them indirect, more ambiguous, and less clear than the paper IRS forms. It is a reflection of the ""cutting corners"" feel of the product when it is less clear than an IRS publication.

As far as the rest of the interface is concerned, the product often leaves you guessing. Sometimes it uses checkboxes for Yes/No answers; sometimes using buttons instead; often there is little obvious indication of what step to take, or what the consequences are of taking an action.

This year was even worse than last year - not only was it still unwieldy and irritating, but it gave me figures that simply did not make sense.  The results for the federal return were OK, but it gave me figures that would have cost me over $2,000 in taxes that I did NOT owe on my state return. I ended up going online to double check my results using a cheap ($10) online service recommended by the NY state tax website. Within 45 minutes, I cleared the online source, and got results that made far more sense. I have no idea what happened with TaxCut, but I suspect that they may have been missing a field somewhere along the line - this is a problem that has been noted by a number of others in reviews on a variety of sites.

When the program transferred my state tax payments to my state tax form, it posted one of the tax payments from my W-2s twice, making it look like I was going to get a refund, when actually I owed taxes.  I just happened to catch the error, then had to spend about an hour manually reviewing my entire return to make sure they weren't pulling the extra payment from somewhere else.  Then the program would not let me override the error.  When I called customer service, they simply told me to override the problem.  (They made no attempt to explain why the error occurred and were completely unconcerned that the program had figured my taxes wrongly.)  When I told them the program would not permit me to override, a ""manager"" came on the line who told me, rudely, I was either stupid or lying.  When I offered to email him a screenshot to verify the problem, he hung up on me.

Fortunately, my state has an easy-to-use online program of its own to do simple returns directly on the web, so I just went there and completed my return.  (The state's program, incidentally, verified that my manual posting was correct and TaxCut's was wrong.)

In fairness, the customer service number was answered promptly, and, except for the rude manager, the agents were polite and really tried to help.  But the bottom line is, what good is a tax program that posts the wrong numbers?  If I hadn't caught this error, I would owe additional taxes and possibly a penalty when the state caught it.  Next year it's TurboTax for me, and I'll do my state return directly online.

The box says it is compatible with Mac OS X and will import data from last year's TurboTax returns so I gave it a try.

I installed the program on my Mac and opened it to start my return. I have a fairly complex return so importing last year's data is a helpful timesaver. Unfortunately, after many attempts I was never able to import anything, not even my name. I called their customer service and tried all kinds of solutions to no avail. They said someone from their ""escalation team"" would contact me within 24-48 hours. Eight days later there was no news from them so I called back. They had no record of my case and I had to go through the whole explanation all over. Once again their rep had no clue how to fix the problem and gave me a phone number to call for further assistance or a refund.

I called the number and once again no case number! A third round of explanations with another service rep and his manager followed with no solution and no money back. Now I must wait for someone in their ""escalation team"" to contact me a fourth time but they will not provide a timeframe for the call.

The delays in response, their inability to track a case number, their weak product knowledge and their reluctance to provide a refund after this much hassle make this a poor product in my opinion.

UPDATE:

A quick update for fairness' sake on my review. Three weeks after my first attempt to use TaxCut I finally figured out what went wrong.

It turns out TaxCut cannot import TurboTax files with password access. I had to disable the password setting on last year's Turbotax and was then able to import data. The second reason I could not import last year's files is because two different customer service reps told me the file had to end in .t05 and NOT .tax.  Well, as it turns out, the latter file is the one that works. A line or a note about this on  the ""Import last years data"" screen would have saved a lot of hassles.

I have not finished my return yet but so far the software seems reasonably good. Turbotax seems to have more resources handy if you don't understand a question (IRS instructions, their own take, etc.) and TurboTax also imports data from brokerages which is helpful.

The software is intuitive enough and I got through the federal part of the return fairly quickly.  However, once that was done, it came time to download the appropriate state forms. When Tax Cut attempted to do this it gave me an error ""Problem (28)"" and said to ""try again later"".  I did this over the course of a couple of days. It did not work. Since this was such trouble, I attempted to download the state portion manually.  This did not work and said that it could not install essentially because TaxCut was not installed (it was installed, I had just done my federal return with it!)

I visited their support website and tried every solution listed for my particular problem (including the classic, ""are you connected to the internet"" solution) - I was, by the way.  I tried uninstalling TaxCut and reinstalling. I installed on a different one of my computers. I disabled my firewall, and altered settings across the board on my PC, and still no luck.

I visited chat support, where I was instructed to do everything I had just done. They were of little help. Finally, I asked for my money back, and they would only give me a partial refund because the federal had loaded. I settled for that, because I had gotten a huge headache.

2755,1,H&R Block,80.5,"04 29, 2008","I've been using TC for about 15 years.  During this time my returns have become increasingly complex as my business has expanded (sole proprietorships, office buildings) and my personal situation has changed (elderly parents needing assistance, children in/out of college/jobs).  TC has been able to handle most of this, but this year I ran into some serious problems.  Here they are:

1.  It's always difficult to coax TC into calculating Fed estimated taxes for the new tax year.  This problem continues.

2.  Whenever hypertext or help is selected, the program responds with a script error.  The help screen can be accessed, but the script error message must first be cleared.  This becomes increasingly annoying as the return is prepared, but not fatal.

3.  The worst problem this year involved making and editing itemized lists.  I use this feature a lot so that the next tax year it can guide my entries based on the previous year.  This way I don't have to re-study the help screens to decide whether this or that item is considered an 'office supply' or 'misc expense'; whether an item should be put on Sched E as a rental expense or on Sched C as a business expense, etc.  I had finished about 75% of my Fed return and suddenly TC would crash whenever I tried to edit or modify an existing itemized list.  I went back and tried to edit a number of lists, but couldn't view the lists and TC crashed and closed each time.

I contacted HRBlock via chat to determine how to fix this.  After the usual waiting..........explaining...............I was told that this problem was not new and that the fix was simple.  All I had to do was discard the 07 return, go back to the 06 return and delete-item by item- all of the itemized lists in that return, re-import the 06 return to the 07 return, and then just re-enter all of the data into the new 07 return...........  DISCARD WHAT NOW?  GO BACK WHERE NOW?  This is an ENTIRELY UNSATISFACTORY solution, I said.  Re-creating the 07 return would take days, what other solutions are there?  None!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I checked over and printed out the 07 return and found that the lists were still intact (but inaccessible to editing) and that the calculations based on the lists were correct.  So I just completed the return workng around the list editing problem.

This is an awful problem.  I don't know what will happen when I try to import this 07 return into the 08 return next year.  Will the lists be there or not, will the numbers import properly or not, what will happen?

As a result, I'm seriously considering TurboTax.",Serious problems
2756,1,H&R Block,80.5,"04 15, 2008","Bought this to do income tax returns to settle an Estate in PA.  I easily entered all the info for filing a final joint return, and got through the Federal e-file verification.  As I went through the PA e-file verification I got a message that PA does not permit joint returns when one of the parties is deceased ... but then the astonishing remainder of the of the messages ... you have to go back and create separate individual federal returns (but not file them) to use to create the separate PA returns!!  It didn't tell me this until AFTER I went through the PA interview! I can't e-file the Federal & PA returns together... so far I haven't figured how to e-file the PA returns because you have to e-file the corresponding e-filed Federal return, but there isn't one.  Tried the free TurboTax to see if it could get me around this... couldn't import the 2007 TaxCut data, only 2006.  Tried a simulated TurboTax joint Federal with deceased ... the PA gave an upfront warning of the need to file separate PA returns and imported the Federal and allowed creation of a single for the primary filer only (couldn't create the deceased spouse PA forms) ... TurboTax pulled in all of the income and didn't exclude the spouse-only items; there is no easy/obvious way to exclude those items.  Tried the free TaxAct and it appears it can't do it right either.  So none of these handle PA well for this situation, although TurboTax appears to be a little closer to getting it right.

I bought this TaxCut bundled s/w to also do the Estate 1041 return.  It's no where near as helpful as the 1040 interview.  It assumes you're familiar with doing a 1041.  I had to do much research outside of this s/w to figure out how to properly report things.

TaxAct doesn't offer s/w with the Estate 1041 forms, so I narrowed my choices to TaxCut or TurboTax.  Neither of them import TaxAct data, so I had to cut/paste from last year's TaxAct 1040 info.  I picked TaxCut over TurboTax simply because of total cost to do 1040 & 1041 forms.  By the way, the 1041 is done with the business tax s/w while the 1040 is done with the personal tax s/w and they don't share data ... you can't import 1099 data stored with a 1040 into a 1041 (it would be nice).",Came up short for handling an Estate in PA

The NY State program does not have many of the credit forms including the IT-245 tax credit form for New York State volunteer firefighters and volunteer ambulance workers.  This omission almost cost me $200.  Sure the software cost $10 less than TurboTax, but it if it leaves out important credits, you are better off going with TurboTax.  According to the TurboTax web site, this form (IT-245), among the others omitted by TaxCut are included.  Additionally, the chat sessions (4 time) were of little help, as well as 3 phone conversations that were dead ends.  Since I already bought the software, I simply wanted to get the needed forms from the internet and fill them out in longhand.  Then I would edit the IT-201 adding the $200 to line 71 and have TaxCut recalculate the refund.  But TaxCut technical support said there is no way to edit, other than crossout and add the items by pen (so much for the software).

There are 96,000 volunteer firefighters (and I don't know how many volunteer ambulance workers) in New York.  That means we are dealing with $20 Million, and if a quarter of the NY volunteer firefighters use this software without question, they stand to loose $5 Million.  Not sure if the software that H&R Block uses at there shops in NY has this problem, but it is sure worth a look. Do yourself a favor and buy TurboTax.",H&R Block TaxCut Federal + State

I used the on-line support, which connected fast, however they just kept telling to do searches in the program's help or search window.  Of course I had already exhausted these options before contacting on-line help.

Finally, I was told the program is not able to process any 1099S's.  I still wonder if this includes the 1099S home sale in the program.

Ok, you will need to manually complete the form below!  That leaves you trying to complete the form same as if you had the blank paper form in front of you with little knowledge of how to complete it!  I went ahead and turned in my 1120S, but only after having a H&R lady review it and help resolve some problems.

So, I though the business taxes were the difficult part - ha!  Now, on to the personal taxes.  When it comes time to do the Schedule E for S-Corp - guess what?  Some situations say the same thing -- manually override the numbers on the form below as appropriate for your situation!!

I found the program to be less user-friendly and less complete in its interview than TurboTax, but I was able to get through the entire process without too much problem.  However, when I conducted a final review of the results, I was stunned to find 2 outright errors.

The key error was that it ignored my AMT Capital Loss Carryover.  The carryover was clearly part of my 2007 return, so I was surprised that it simply ignored this value on the 2008 calculation. When I called TaxCut support, they told me that TaxCut ""does not support this feature"".  Remarkably, nowhere does their literature suggest that their product does not support some parts of the tax act.  Even more remarkably, when it imported my 2007 data and saw that there was a 2007 AMT Captial Loss Carryover, the program did not bother to raise a warning that it was about to ignore this value.

So, I had to buy TurboTax afterall.  TurboTax correctly calculated my AMT for 2008.  After it was done, I did a line-by-line comparison of the TaxCut and TurboTax returns.  I was even more stunned to find that this uncovered a simple math error in the TaxCut return.  Yes, a math error -- TaxCut multiplied two numbers together and came up with the incorrect result.  I triple-checked this bcause I could not believe it myself, but the TaxCut calculation is simply wrong (form 8829, line 41).

Original:  This year I have several returns to do (S Corp, Estate, Joint, Kids).  I purchased TaxCut home and business because of the fact that it would cost about 2x as much to purchase all the TurboTax programs I needed.

The personal returns have gone fairly well and I'm happy with them.  The Estate and business returns are a nightmare.  The interviews are worthless.  Mostly it says that you should click on 'whole form' and enter the information that is appropriate for your situation.  It would be easier to download the forms from the IRS--at least then you would know that you weren't getting any useful guidance.  I went through the complete CA state return before discovering that TaxCut didn't transfer the capital gains correctly.  Online support said that 'Estate returns are too complicated and they would escalate'.  I haven't heard anything back yet.  Finally I just overode the entry with the correct number, but I'm afraid there are other things I didn't catch.

This year, the 2008 version DOES NOT INCLUDE FREE e-filing for the state return!

Last year I paid $59.95 for this version of the software.

This year the software cost me $49.99,but now I have to shell out another $19.95 to e-file my state return!

That's an increase of 16.66% over last year's version by the very same name!

I am MOST disappointed in the fact that NO WHERE on the packaging does it say that e-filing for the state was not included, or that it would cost extra.

I expected more from a reputable company as H&R Block, and feel that they have stooped to both deceptive and evasive advertising practices in order to improve their bottom line by short changing repeat customers.

No matter how you cut it, I'm paying $10 more than I paid last year AND I got blind-sided by a company name I thought I knew and trusted!

SOMEWHERE on the package it should have said e-filing for state returns is no longer included and will now cost an additional $19.95.

I realize this is by no means equal in comparison to what Intuit has done to their TurboTax customers, but still, the makers of TaxCut should be held to the same standard, and therefore, they should be ""called-out"" for their most recent and deceptive pricing scheme!

3. This is the WORST part.  I submit my return via e-file.  The next day, got an email from taxcut with the following subject line: ""TaxCut: Tax Return Successfully Transmitted"".  Well, i thought great, i'm done.  Months later, i had not receive any refund and upon checking into it.  My return was actually rejected due to an error.

One example is that I e-filed my federal return, then chose to mail my state return.

1)  There are no forms for foreign nationals that have the benefit of a tax treaty with the US.

2)  I moved mid-year, so had two states.  The software never asked or would allow me to e-file the second state return - it seems to think you should only e-file one state return

3)  I tried to prepare a return for a friend that involved three states.  I paid 30 clams to buy the extra state for his return, and the software just simply could not handle it - we went through all the steps, but it just couldn't figure out how to allocate income to 3 states and reported zeros for all taxes on the third state

4)  Printing and e-filing was another disaster.  You never know when people ask for a copy of your tax return (anyone try to get a mortgage recently without full documentation?).  With turbotax, I could efile and still print a full tax return like I was going to paper file - that tax return looked like a real paper return and not a ""summary"".  With Taxcut, after I efiled, it only lets me print a ""summary"" return - it doesn't even provide the choice to print a paper return anymore.  If anyone asks me for a copy of my official 2008 tax return I am out-of-luck.

DONT DO IT. I Don't love turbo tax, but it is much superior to this product.

They also play some games with charging for E-file.  The packaging (some vary) says my copy of Taxcut includes Federal + State + Efile, but that is only Federal E-file (it will allow 5 federal E-files).

Similar errors with Taxes due section.
It's appalling because this was not a fancy calculation, it's just adding & substracting and getting WRONG in MANY DIFFERENT WAYS (i.e. it's not consistently telling me that A+B=D in the different sections of the form).

Buyer beware, use at your own risk (& manually check the math when you're done --- a real pain because I paid $50 for the program precisely to avoid having to manually crunch the numbers).  Good look.

Tax Cut doesn't allow me to download my W2 or investment data from my financial institutions. I now have to double check my data to ensure that I have fat fingered the data correctly.

I do not feel confident that my return is accurate which will require me to spend significantly more time reviewing it.

If the amount of time you want to spend preparing your return is a concern and you feel that you purchase the software for yourself and not to run a small family tax service, Turbo Tax is a superior product.",Not as good as Turbo Tax
2863,1,H&R Block,26.99,"02 7, 2009","I just returned my copy of TaxCut. Good thing they have a 60 day refund policy.

When I saved my returns to an Adobe PDF file (see review below about the shareware utility they use), all of the worksheets were unreadable. The width of the worksheet content seemed to be set for about half the page width, which caused page overflow. Margins at the top cut off content. Not at all usable. The IRS forms were fine, so it's not me.

I'm using a wide-screen display, maybe they took the display size and scaled it. Don't know. Don't care. I have a problem and have no way to fix it. TaxCut needs to test their software better. Back to TurboTax.

========== Earlier review=======================
Everything was going OK until I tried to print the return to a PDF file. Without my permission or knowledge, TaxCut installed a program called ""pdf995"". It's used to create PDF files. If you don't print to PDF files, the software is not installed.

Run the separate program, installed as Software995 in your Program list. There are ads. There are IE windows with ads - it launches IE without my permission.

The add/remove programs lists it as ""Pdf995 (Installed by Tax Cut)"". Like that makes it OK. It's not even a licensed version, it's the shareware version. They should have just installed the driver and left the software out.

This little gem is going to reinstall itself if I run TaxCut and check for updates, without me knowing about it. I'll also have to manually uninstall it after I'm done with TaxCut.

To be clear, this is not spyware or a virus. The correct term is ""crapware"" (stuff installed without your permission that does nothing but sell you products).","It can't print PDF files correctly, Uses shareware for driver."

My 6 month old 64 bit pc has presented me with a few software compatibility issues.  So, when the time came to get my 2008 tax software, I checked before I bought.  TurboTax pretty much said they didn't 'officially' support 64 bit but if I tried it and it didn't work, I could get a full refund within 30 days.  Nice to know but a pain, nonetheless.  Instead, I installed my old 2007 TurboTax version and files and they worked just fine.  So I bought TurboTax 2008 and it seems to be working fine, both State and Federal versions, importing previous year data, entering new data and linking to website for updates.

Then I installed TaxCut 2008. The install was okay (after a little bit of a hiccup) but it freezes up everytime I try to run it.

[...]
But I do not think this is the issue. Last year I had a totally different AV software and I had the same failures.

I have worked out a manual work around, although it is ridiculous. The updater that TaxCut uses seems unable to acquire ""create"" permissions for its own directories, regardless of the fact that the permissions are set OK. I have verified this by the log files which generate installer error 1321 (The installer has insufficient priveleges...) Apparently, the installer has no problem updating existing files, it just cannot create new ones.

To work around this, do as follows:
- In TaxCut, choose ""Update after I close the program"".
- Close TaxCut and when Vista UAC asks permission to run the installer, click ""Cancel"".
- Locate the installer (should be in C:\ProgramData\TaxCut\2008\Update)
- Right click the file and choose ""Run as administrator""
- When you encounter the first error, note the filename and location
- Go to the Start Menu and find Notepad. Right-click on the program icon and choose ""Run as administrator""
- Put some text in the Notepad file. I put ""<HTML> </HTML>"".
- Choose ""File -> Save As"" and save the file with the exact name and path that the installer complained about
- Choose ""Retry"" or ""Continue"" in the installer (I can't remember the exact wording)
- Repeat the last two steps for each file that needs to be created. I think there were 10-20 of them.

Eventually, once you have created all the files, the installer will succeed.

It does not matter what text you put in the file as long as you get the filename and path right. TaxCut will overwrite the file anyway.

This is a ridiculous work around, but I already paid for TaxCut and got a good deal on my AV software because of it. If I can make it through this year, I am going back to TaxAct in 2009.

UPDATE: There is a major error in the MA state version for non-residents! In 2008, MA instituted a law requiring residents to have health insurance. If you do not, you must pay a tax penalty at the end of the year. This law does NOT apply to non-residents. TaxCut knows this (it says ""You don't have to answer questions related to health care"") but then proceeds to apply the penalty anyway because by default it assumes you have NO health care!

2907,1,H&R Block,10.5,"03 6, 2009","The one star rating is not about the Tax Cut software, which I've used for many years, but rather Amazon's software download service.  Thinking I would be environmentally friendly and skip the packing and shipping, I opted to purchase TaxCut via Amazon download rather than the boxed set. It turned into a multi-hour headache that ultimately never worked, despite the fact that I am a CompTIA A+ certified computer technician with years of experience configuring and troubleshooting systems.  Buyer beware:

1) Nowhere on the product description front-page does Amazon tell you that you first need to install the ""Amazon Games & Software Downloader"" software onto your computer.  There is no direct download link to the TaxCut software.

2) The Amazon Games & Software Downloader software has serious flaws.  After installation, I repeatedly received an ""update required"" error message when trying to download TaxCut -- even though I had just installed the latest version.  Uninstalling, rebooting, redownloading and reinstalling the software twice did not resolve the issue.

3) I sent an email to tech support, which responded simply that this error ""is typically associated with a personal firewall or network blocking internet access of the Amazon Games & Software Downloader.""  I disabled both the built-in Windows firewall and plugged the computer directly into the cable modem to bypass the router's firewall altogether, still to no luck.

4) Fed up with the process, I requested a refund since I had never successfully downloaded the TaxCut software or obtained a licensing code.  I was informed that ""software downloads are not returnable once they've been purchased.  Since you are having trouble downloading, we highly recommend calling for further troubleshooting steps.""

5) I called the tech support number (technically they called me, since you have to enter your phone number on a web page and wait for a call-back, which admittedly happened almost immediately.)  The first call dropped, a glitch the VoIP system they seem to use.  They second call connected me to a very nice, but technically limited young man who kept reading to me generic ""fixes"" from a script.  When I asked him which ports the Amazon Games & Software Downloader actually used, he had to go ask his supervisor (and never got a response.)  His final ""solution"" was that I should find another computer on which to attempt the download, then burn the file to a CD and load it onto my main computer from the CD.  At that point, I simply refused to continue with this debacle and he admitted that they have had a lot of similar issues with the software and it is currently being revised.  He finally agreed to issue a credit for the purchase.

Long story short: Amazon's download process is still only half cooked.  If you run into problems, you'll have to jump through hoops before they agree to refund the money.

I'm stuck.

I'm not going to install 8 updates willy-nilly, hoping one (or more) of them will solve the problem.

First, If you use schedule C in TurboTax, it does not important everything from the previous data. It does not important the 1099-MISC data either.  You have to re-enter all the info on the 1099 all over again! If you have a stable but large number of people or companies issuing 1099 to you each year, the need to re-enter the information takes a lot of time and kills any incentive to switch!

Second, if you have more than a couple stock transactions on Schedule D, you don't want this program either. Not only it does not have the ability to download those transactions directly from financial companies, it is unable to import complete transaction data from Quicken either! It only imported stock sales data but not the matching stock purchase data from Quicken and as result; one has to manually enter the data! Further more, I find it hard to understand why they cannot even implement a basic account filter that only limit the data important from selected accounts. So, on one hand, it does not import enough data but on the other it imports too much unwanted data! I am requesting a refund for the product as they have money back guarantee.

Put it another way, even thought I spent $60+ for this ""tax"" software, I had to purchase the online edition of TurboTax just to finish my taxes.

If you have used TurboTax before, H&R Software is VERY cumbersome and difficult to use in comparison. Unlike TurboTax, H&R has no easy way to narrow the categories of tax prep that may be of interest to you. Instead, you are bombarded by a million questions, none of which may relate to your situation. There is no easy way to exit these these screens, and you are forced to answer questions which are meaningless to you.

In TurboTax, you can pick and and choose which categories of tax items apply to you, and the wizard then guides you in a very easy way to answer questions about the selected categories.

All in all, I spent $100 for the TurboTax edition just to feel confidant that I did not miss anything in my returns. TurboTax has made a lifelong customer today.  I will never buy another H&R product.","If you used TurboTax in the past, DO NOT BUY this software"

1.  When entering stock sales the very first entry has a problem.  It will not bring up the menu for entering whether it is a wash sale.  All subsequent entries bring up this menu.  A workaround is to reenter the same info later, and then delete the first entry.
2.  When you encounter the Making Work pay credit, it tells you to click go to... and eventually it will bring up the menu to ask whether you are elegible.  Well it DOESN't bring up the menu.  So you have to bring up the form and manually click whether you received a 250 tax credit check.

With major goofs like this, one wonders if it will file the taxes correctly.  So it may be Turbo Tax next year.  HR Block needs to get their software act together.

I'm surprised to find out turbotax is way better than taxcut. There are many problems with taxcut, but there two reasons I'll not use taxcut again.
1. taxcut can't calculate the CA SDI correctly.
Taxcut can't carry the W-2 information to my CA return. I made the excess contribution to CA SDI and it's on the W-2 form. In the CA mini-worksheet, my contribution is shown $0. Turbotax is showing the right amount. I just can't believe Taxcut doesn't do the right thing in such a simple case.
2. taxcut has very limited imported W-2 or financial institution.
With taxcut, I have to enter everything manually. With Turbotax, for me everything can be imported. So it turned out to be much faster and easier to use turbotax.

Taxcut or hrblock at home is cheaper, but given it's so buggy and problematic it doesn't worth any penny on it.

2945,1,H&R Block,99.8,"03 26, 2010","I have used Tax Cut (now HR Block at Home) for several years. It was never a perfect product but I was usually able to muddle through and get my taxes done. This year however, I had some major issues with the program.

1. I purchased the Premium version since I own my own business. Even though the ""Deluxe"" version does Schedule C too, ""Premium"" looked more appealing since it supposedly has ""Advanced Schedule C guidance"". Well perhaps it does, but it couldn't accurately figure out my Section 179 Depreciation deduction which directly impacts my business profit/loss. Well so much for that extra special ""Premium"" feature I guess.

2. The other appeal of the ""Premium"" version was one free question with the ""Ask a Tax Advisor"". I tried using this to resolve the Section 179 issue I mentioned above. What a joke! The tax ""professional"" they put me in touch with looked and acted VERY unprofessional. Her appearance (there's a webcam photo in the chat window) and demeanor were both horrible. After half a day wasted going back and forth, her only ""solution"" was to go to the HR Block website, sign up for ""Best of Both"", and she would then calculate the depreciation deduction for me. Cost? $79.95. (This was on top of the what I had already spent.) FORGET ABOUT IT. When I protested, she, and later HR Block Customer Support, claimed she ""answered"" my question, so if I wanted to finish my return, ""Best of Both"" ($80) was the only way they would help. I eventually did my best to figure out the  deduction on my own - god knows if I got it right. (Later I found a similar issue with my SEP contribution/deduction. The program was unable to tell me what my maximum deduction would be, so I had to wing it there as well.)

Bad enough the program doesn't do the calculations it promises. But at least be apologetic for it. Instead they claimed that telling me to pay an additional $80 ""answered"" my question.

(You'd also think HR Block would have offered me another free consult with a tax advisor in case I had another issue. Even Microsoft won't charge you for a support call if your issue isn't resolved by their people. But as far as HR Block was concerned, I had used my one free call.)

I later contacted the customer support phone # and the manager I spoke with issued me another key code so I could try a different Tax Advisor. I thought ""great, someone else will see how the software has failed me, and I'll get it taken care of."" But here's the best part: The second ""Tax Advisor"" I got was the first one's sister!

I had no problem with the 06, 07, 08 taxes; everything worked fine. This new product for 2009 is not like that. It does NOT allow direct user input into the form. You are forced to go through the interview which in some cases makes the error worse. It has a very nasty glitch in Schedule E (Royalties). The first time you go through it it seems to be recording the correct royalty income values, but when you hit the final ""check"", the program reports ""errors"" for the royalty schedule and points at the ""missing"" information in the worksheet (which the program should have completed properly since the user did it via the interview). The information requested is not clear, there is no help file to resort to, and after trying to interpret and guess what the program requires for the ""incomplete box"", the reported input gets doubled or tripled... Of course your complete tax gets spoiled and you need to delete all entries for this schedule and start again, since as I said above there is no user access to the actual form any more in this 2009 version.

I called the support line at H&R to report the problem and to ask them how to go around these glitch. After several minutes of waiting for a response because the lady that answered the phone had to consult some other experts, what I got back was that H&R can not help me because I bought the product ""via Amazon and not through them."" That what I had to do was to return the CD to Amazon and buy directly from them! I asked the lady then if they have a newer version in their site which has this bug fixed, and the answer was that there are many bugs being reported and that she was not aware of how updated such version was. I asked if I was the first person to report this Schedule E bug, and she said that she personally had not heard it before. I asked why H&R will not tell me how to go around the problem and help me complete my tax return on that very day, and she insisted that it was because I did not buy the product from them.

I do not know if I was talking to a mentally retarded employee in the customer support area, but all I can tell is that it all sounded extremely ridiculous and I was at that point quite furious so I sent her to hell and hanged the phone. To make a long story short, I'll be buying TurboTax tomorrow from a local shop instead of the Internet to avoid shipping delays. The quality of the product and the disgusting interaction with the H&R customer service had convinced me that it is not a good option any more.

2952,1,H&R Block,99.8,"02 27, 2010","Summary:
H&R Block At Home Premium software is a waste of money.  It can handle the basics, but don't expect it to actually be able to help you with reporting anything even slightly complicated with stock sales.  In addition, the ""Ask a Tax Advisor"" feature that is touted on the box is so useless that it almost constitutes a scam (see details below).

I used the precursor to H&R Block At Home Deluxe successfully the past two years, but the Premium edition is a waste of money.  If you need any features that Deluxe can't offer, spend your money on Turbo Tax or a real tax professional (NOT from H&R Block if their ""Ask a Tax Professional"" service is representative).

Full Story:
I bought the H&R Block At Home Premium software, specifically because it was advertised as the version that could help me with stock sales.  I sold some ESPP stock last year, and the rules around that are a little strange, but nothing that software shouldn't be able to figure out how to manage.  Taking data in, following rules, and spitting numbers out is what computers DO, after all.  And if I ran into trouble, I figured, there was always the ""Ask a Tax Advisor"" incident that came free with the Premium package.

I was completely disappointed.  I couldn't figure out how to enter the information I needed to enter to allow the software to calculate ordinary income on the ESPP stock sale.  So, my first stop was the ""Ask a Tax Advisor"" feature.  I went through a few gymnastics to create an account on their site, entered my code and my question, and settled down to wait.  I was careful to be precise about exactly what the trouble was.  I submitted my question on 2/13 at about 7:30pm and had an answer back the next day at about 4:11pm.  Nice, less than a  24 hour turnaround on a weekeend.

Unfortunately, what I got back was a single ""sentence"" answer that told me to do something I'd already stated that the program wouldn't let me.  I use quotation marks around ""sentence"" because the string of words featured no capitalization and no punctuation.  As a bonus, all the information in it was wrong too.  A few more exchanges over the course of two weeks followed.  All of the form of me providing several paragraphs of information, replied to after several days with a single sentence.  The single sentence sometimes contained acronyms that were capitalized, but never any punctuation.  All the information was either always wrong, restating something I'd already said, or telling me (in very vague terms) to do something that the software wouldn't let me do.

At this point, I have actually contacted Fidelity on my own and figured out how to do the calculation of ordinary income myself.  I have all the numbers and, by the end, I just wanted the tax advisor to tell me where on the tax forms to enter them.  That seems like a reasonable request, but I was doomed to be disappointed.  The icing on the cake was the answer to my last reply.  I'd figured out three possibilities myself.  I detailed all three and simply asked the tax advisor to tell me the number of the one that was right.  Five days later, the response I got started with ""did you get your return finished?"" and then tried to sell me on taking it to an H&R Block office or buying the Return Review service they offer.

I got an additional bonus with that response as well.  After I got it, I noticed that the following text had been retroactively added to all of the responses.  I don't recall seeing it before, and I would have noticed, since it greatly exceeds the length of all the responses I got. Combined.  With this disclaimer, it isn't clear why anyone would use the ""Ask a Tax Advisor"" service at all:

This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided. Any change or addition to those facts could materially and adversely affect our analysis and conclusions, and in that event, the analysis should not be relied upon.""

I started a support case with H&R Block on the software in parallel with the above, once it became apparent that the ""Ask a Tax Advisor"" route was going to be a dead end.  The tier one support was knowledgeable about the software, and quickly saw the dead end that I'd run into.  It got escalated to tier 2 with no hassle, but the response time there is 2-5 days.  This is day 4.  I'm still waiting on the response, but at this point I just expect to use their failure to help me as leverage to receive a refund so I can go buy Turbo Tax instead.

The complete issue, in case you're curious, is that the software makes the assumption that the ordinary income from a qualifying disposition of ESPP stock will be included in box 1 of your W2.  While that is apparently True for a disqualifying disposition, it is not required for a qualifying disposition.  The calculation is not difficult (less than 10 minutes in Excel gave me the answer, and a lot of that was data entry), you just need some information from the original purchase of the stock.  Indeed, it SEEMS like they started to implement the calculation in the wizard, but then ran out of time, slapped the incorrect assumption into the program, and called it good.

UPDATE:
Tier 2 support never did contact me back.  At least their money back guarantee worked quickly and with no hassle.  Though it is a ""60 day"" guarantee, so if you bought the program early, you'd be out of luck when it disappointed you.

I bought Turbo Tax and after an hour or so of data entry, it spit everything out correctly, including automatically dealing with the issue that dead-ended me with the H&R Block product.  It wound up costing less than 5 dollars more, and that 5 dollars is totally worth it given how little hassle and frustration it was, and how much more quickly I was finished (1 hour vs more than a month)","Good for basics, not so good for anything out of the ordinary"

is 10,000K vs 56K.

I told this supervisor to check the H&R block server log files and he could see the download only reached 650K out of 2.48Meg  before it STOPPED.  He claimed no one could do that.

He asked where I got the software and proceeded to tell me I needed to contact the company that sold it to me, in order to get support.

I read the back of the H&R block software package to him, which clearly STATED that the end user was to contact H&R BLOCK FOR SUPPORT.

When I directed him to the online vendor's website, he said that vendor was NOT authorized as a reseller.

I brought up the software vendor's website and informed Derek that the same vendor was selling a newer version of H&R Block tax software again this year. He still acted like the online vendor was NOT authorized to sell H&R block's tax software.

I have NEVER had a customer service person act so assinine and try to pass the buck as many times as this guy did.
And he was a supposedly a supervisor???

I ended up filing a BBB complaint against H&R Block for their failure to provide the state software package, which I paid for and which WAS a part of the Deluxe package.

- auto download of payroll W-2's? Nope.
- auto population of demographics from last year's tax form? Nope. (TurboTax can import from TT, At Home, and Tax Act).
- easy to use? Varied wildly, but lots of places the answer was no. More than once the only answer I found was on the tax form itself.
Also, I had these experiences:
-At the end it does a check of the data entry. That's good. Unfortunately, it found an error but gave me no context on how to fix the error. I spent 45 finutes trying to figure out how to fix the error.
-I owe estimated taxes for next year. After promising me that there was 3 different ways to handle estimated taxes, it sent me directly into one of the ways I did not want to use.

Among the aggravations of this product are:

1) If you change filing status, you must re-enter all your data; the software claims that ""tax rules are too complicated to import from previous years."" Good grief, if it's too complicated for the program to do, but I can do it by hand, then why on earth should I be paying for this software?

2) It didn't keep track of where files are stored; you must browse to your files each and every time you open the return.

3) Deduction Pro is now an online app, and it does not inspire confidence; it is extremely slow and clumsy, and it does not work with all browsers. Help files are sorely lacking. Beware! It took 21(!) tries and finagles to get it to import my data file from the previous year.

4) Not straightforward to review your return before filing. The software takes you to the e-file screen immediately upon completion, without giving you the opportunity to review the whole return first - you have to stop, go find and print the file on your own if you'd like to be sure. This kind of review should be the built-in last step in the programmed sequence of events before filing. This is not a new flaw, and it still hasn't been fixed.

The software should have just called this an error to begin with and forced me to fix it prior to filing because once I got to that step, it refused to automatically enter my refund amount into the tax return and I had to do it manually.

So in summary:
- the one star ranking is because it failed me on the main reason I bought it- no import of last year's return
- the software is easy enough to use, I don't know if it is better or worse than last years.
- because of the failed import I may just go to turbo tax next year.

This year my tax situation is a little more complex. I was on the workshare program half the year, so I was getting unemployment benefits for 1 day a week plus the $25/wk economic recovery benefit. The 1099G Minnesota sent me includes the $700 I got for the economic recovery benefit in with the other unemployment benfits for a total over $3,000. But there is no place in the program where you can tell it that $700 of that is economic recovery benefits which are not supposed to be taxable. So my taxes are about $100 more than they should be. After trying to figure it out myself for an hour or so I finally called tech support. The fellow who tried to help me wasn't too bad, but didn't know enough to resolve the issue after more thna 2 hrs of trying!

H&R Block told me today that if you override the entries to correct these problems this voids the accuracy guarantee of their software.

1. Income from a 1099-R entered on the PA Miscellaneous Compensation Worksheet it is not transfered to the PA Schedule W-2S.

2. Itemized interest income entered on the PA Schedule A Worksheet is not being listed item-by-item on the PA Schedule A. The PA Schedule A lists just the total and says to see the worksheet.

Both of these are killers for submitting the PA return, which has to be mailed because you have to attach copies of the 1099-R to the return.

I found the same problem if I imported last years TurboTax return into a return or started a new one from scratch.

I was on the phone with their tech support for over an hour today and 30 minutes yesterday. They escalated the problem up to the next level today and promised to get back to me within 48 hours.

If they can't fix the problem I am going to ask for a refund, you have 60 days from the date of purchase.

Further Info as of Feb-4-2010:

After numerous contacts with H&R Block tech support, having the case escalated, and sending them an encrypted return they informed me that this is the way the PA software is supposed to work.

But:

1) You can't submit the  dividend/interest worksheets with your return, they are not offcial PA forms. PA wants the items listed on the PA Sched A&B; 2) You are supposed to submit a joint PA A&B if your 1099s are all for joint holdings; 3)The software doesn't transfer the data from the Misc Comp Worksheet to the Wage Statement Summary (PA W-2S) schedule. You have to overide the entries which makes you ineligible to eFile your PA return (which I can't anyway); 4) If you do file by mail a return with overridden entries then their gaurantee to stand behind their software does not apply.

I called tech support again Monday.  Their solution is:

Apply for a refund, i.e., you send them a copy of the receipt and the UPC and they will close the case out. Of course they don't refund your sales tax or the mailing cost to get it to them.

So I tried to install the program from the CD on my new computer - which HRBlock's website claims is fine - except the instructions they give for doing it are wrong. (They tell you to go to such-and-such screen and click on the ""more"" arrow, except there is no ""more"" arrow there, and all it does is direct you to the HRBlock website where, lucky you, you can re-purchase the program!)

Then the attempt to install the Home Business 2009 portion of the package. I tried all kinds of ways to get this done successfully, by double-clicking, by running as admin, after cleaning the local temp folder prior of running the executable.

Result: It never does complete. The ""Installing Setup Files"" message box stays on the screen forever. The windows task manager shows a running application but that is as far as it goes.

How good is a software when you can't even finish the installation routine successfully?? I think that speaks for itself.

I have always purchased the version that includes the state download.  In the past the cost of the state download was included in the purchase of the product.  You would normally just have to pay the e-file charge.  That is not the case with this version, even though from the product description it is supposed to include the federal, state, 5 free federal e-files, and then a charge for the state efile.  Upon using the program, after you get done with the federal portion, you will get to the section where you need to select your state program and download it.  The catch is that you need to pay an additional $29.95 for the state download, and then the $19.95 to e-file it.  I contacted H&R Block via online chat, and was informed that the meaning of the included state program was the option to download it for an additional fee.

So from the product description of this digital download version offered here by Amazon, I felt very mislead when I was informed of this fact.  So the cost savings really is not there when you take into account this extra fee that is not advertised anywhere on the product description.  Which puts the total price very much in line with the more expensive Turbotax.  So next year I will be sure to go with TurboTax over this product due to the non advertised price of the state download not being properly advertised for this years version of TaxCut.

Amazons description does not list the price of an additional state anywhere; the cost is $29.95+tax.

Now I also find out that the cost efiling my states will be over $40, I guess I'll be printing and mailing them. I was misled by this products description of free-efile, that is my fault, but the absurd cost for efiling each state and buying the second state can only be blamed on the manufacturer of this product - H & R Block.

After about forty minutes repeating these steps with a tech support rep, he agreed that my CD was defective and said he would send me a download link.

He REFUSED to ESCALATE my quality issue to the QC department and REFUSED to give me the contact number of the corporate office to report the problem we encountered, refused to have someone follow up by calling me tomorrow, and did not even provide a mailing address to write to the corporate office about an easy-to-fix problem, a problem that will cause us several extra hours of refiling the Amended 1040X return.  Also he refused to refund my purchase price or to honor their ""Maximum Refund Guarantee"" as detailed on their website.  Apparently, their guarantee is worthless, just pure marketing BS.

Bottom Line:  DONT BUY H&R BLOCK PREMIUM & BUSINESS!  They do not care about the quality of their software and they don't care about their customers either.  Worse, their Customer Support agents are poorly trained and incompetent know-nothings to boot.","Argh!!  Thanks to H&R's Poor Design, We have to file a 1040X and got a $630 lower Refund!!"
3086,1,H&R Block,55.5,"03 31, 2011","This is a real piece of junk of a tax prep. software for business.  I created an LLC last year so this is my first time having to file a tax return for a business.  Chose H&R over TurboTax because of the cost (almost 40% cheaper).  Anyway, it's a piece of crap.

1) If you use medium-sized font for your desktop (which I do since I have a 22"" monitor), the fields and labels are all over the place, overlapping one another.  Contacted tech support via online chat and they told me to switch my desktop font back to small (default, 96DPI font). Geez, nice....

2) So I started a new return for my LLC, entered the entity name & EIN, etc. Few pages later, I'm being asked again the entity name and EIN.... DUUUUH.

3) The ""interview questions"" are bullcrap. They pretty much ask you the same questions as listed in the IRS forms. For example:  ""For this tax year, did the partnership make an optional basis adjustment under section 743(b) or 734(b)?  [Yes] or  [No]""  I'm like, what the hell is ""743(b) and 734(b)""??  If I have to read the IRS manual to fill this out, then why did I even bother with this software??

4) When you respond ""No"" to a question, then shouldn't the software skip the section?? It doesn't. You select NO, and it still takes you to the next section as if you had answered YES.  DUUUUH DUUUUHHHH.

There are several questions like that.  Anyway, I'm so fed up with this after 30 mins of use.  I need a refund for this crap.","My GOD, what a piece of junk software!"

1.  Interview mode is not very intuitive or helpful for all forms.  On some forms the interview is fine but on a lot of other forms the interview basically tells you to click whole form and complete if necessary, with no further instructions.
2.  You can not efile business returns.  I did not realize this when I purchased.
3.  Government instructions where not always available.  After click the instructions, many times a message would come back stating that it was not currently available and to try again later.
4.  The software kept filling out a schedule that was not necessary for my business.

One might think that Amazon.com is obviously an ""approved vendor,"" but that apparently is not True.  Since the downloaded versions purchased from Amazon are managed by a different vendor, ""Amazon Digital Services,"" your only recourse, if the software doesn't work properly, is to request a refund from Amazon Digital--and their refund policies seem to be vastly more conservative than the H&R guarantee (i.e., 30 days rather than 60 days) that is quoted in ads regarding this product.

My specific problem is that the business portion of this software didn't install on my Windows 7, 64 bit computer, despite repeated removal and reinstallation efforts.  People on this website and others have noted similar problems for the business element of the product, and the only work-around seems to involve jury-rigging the software through removal and reinstallation in conjunction with one or more external files--with the result that, although the software will work, it can't be updated.  Utterly useless.

As an experienced system builder and software writer I figured I would be relatively immune to the install problems others have reported here with Windows 7. Well I was wrong. HRB did install in my Win 7 - 64bit system, and I did manage to import last years business return and create W-2's for employees and a W-3 for this year - just. Then it stopped working. Would not start (even when running as admin), yet refuses to uninstall because it claims to be still running; will install in XP virtual machine but then cannot access files I have already created in the 'real' Win-7 machine. I can deal with these issues, but I shouldn't have to. Most of them are peculiar to my own machine it is True, but software for release into the real world must be written and QC'd to handle all sorts of individual system quirks. Maybe it's 'OK' if something like a game doesn't run on some systems, or needs special tweaking, but it's inexcusable for mission-critical software like TaxCut. And if the system interface has been poorly QC'd there are obvious questions about how well the tax rules and computations have been checked. The HRB software is far from ready for release to the general public. In my own case, having handled (barely) everything I absolutely needed to get done by Jan 31, and fortunately having saved hardcopies of everything, I will probably sit tight and see what happens with updates of HRB, but unless there's a BIG improvement in its stability in Win 7 in the next month or so I'd guess I'll be doing my final taxes in TurboTax, much as I hate the thought.

I called customer support, and they said ""no,"" but an independent distributor said ""yes,"" so I took a chance - and ""yes"" was the correct answer - score 1 for the program, 0 for tech support.

In general, I find HR Block program less helpful.  I mean, if I were a tax expert, I wouldn't need any software at all, would I?  But, this has allowed me to do my own taxes without having some strangers look at my personal information in this age of identity theft.  Good enough.

Then came this year's taxes.  I always file in February since we're supposed to have received all tax reporting forms by then, right?  So, I dutifully filed in late February and paid my taxes due in early March.  My husband had won a radio prize late in 2010 and the value we were given in the prize acknowledgment letter was $700.  That's the amount we reported.  The radio station never sent us a 1099-MISC form, until 3/24/11.  The 1099-MISC shows $760(!), which was postmarked 3/21/11.  So, I entered the new info into HR Block so it can generate the 1040X form for me.  Those terrible huge numbers in the upper right corner tell me I owe additional $15 in federal on the extra $60, but the 1040X form it generates tells me I'm now due a $5 refund???  That the amount I paid in March was more than I needed to pay after I have $60 more in misc. income???

Baffled and confused, I called IRS.  Several transfers and long hold time, I finally got to someone who seemed to know what he's talking about.  He advised that I fill out a 1040X form by hand and mail in a check of $15 with the form.  Simple enough.  And I'd rather pay a little more now instead of having to get penalized later.  I know someone who's had that terrible experience so I want to avoid it.

What's more outrageous is the California portion.  The big number in the upper right corner tells me that I owe no additional taxes with that $60 difference.  I went through the motion with the 540X form.  The HR Block generated 540X form tells me that I had zero tax liability and that I was due a refund of all the taxes I had paid!  As tempting as that sounds, I know it must be wrong.  I looked through the numbers on the form.  Sure enough, some of the automated calculated fields were not programmed correctly.  I called Franchise Tax Board and confirmed that I did not have to file a 540X form since the tax amount did not change.

I can understand they may not have all it fully automated, due to a large variety of possible K-1 line items. But at the very minimum, there should be a support for LP sell transactions and calculation of ordinary/capital gains. This part is about the same for all partnerships and should be easy to implemnent. As for the rest of K-1 handling, a good help system would also do it. None of it is there.
At this point I decided to use online the help system. After all, the program has backing of H&R Block. I tried Ask a Tax Advisor feature, but the code provided to me by Amazon didn't work. I've called the program support, and after a few attempts I've finally got a one-time code that did work. I asked my question, but the only tax advise I've got was ""to put it all on Schedule D"". Well, as much as I understand the limited partnership taxation rules, this advise is just plain wrong.
I searched more on the Internet and I learned that only TurboTax has support for limited partnerships. Apparently, not all tax programs are created equal. This was the last time I've bought TaxCut, even if I'm going to re-type all my data manually in TurboTax.",No support for limited partnerships & bad tax advise

I've been relatively happy since. Now, I am going to try TurboTax, because it nearly cost me serious money.

We have 2 home-office businesses, so I went through the interview for both offices and filled in blanks as requested. The program failed to inform me that I should NOT enter the Real Estate Tax in both offices and allow it to carry the remainder automatically to Schedule A (the program added the remainders).  Also, when I went thru the interview for Schedule A, it did NOT put up any kind of warning about the Home Offices, but blindly asked me to enter My Real Estate Taxes.  As a result, the program reported RET 275% higher than it should have ($11k instead of $3.7k).

Fortunately, I caught the error before I filed. Result: I had to go back and file Amended taxes for the previous year, and owed about $1,000 more.

The program handled Mortgage Interest correctly, subtracting each Home Office Deduction from the total, and reporting a reduced claim on Schedule A. So it is possible.  Stupid error.

There are a couple other things that have been really annoying over the years:
1) When you create an itemized sheet for an entry blank, you can't just right-click on the blank and go to the Itemized sheet.  It gives you a list of ALL of the lines in the tax form that have Itemized Sheets and asks you to select which one you want to open.  Duh!

I am pretty knowledgeable on taxes, and have my return basically done in a spreadsheet before I start with tax software. For most of us, this year's tax isn't too much different than last year's tax. With the right forms and instructions in front of you, a tax return isn't rocket science in most cases. I use the tax software to inform me of tax law changes and to help me determine what situations apply to me. The main advantages have always been importing last year's data, the interview process, and e-filing. After my experiences this year, I don't expect to waste my money on this software anymore. Software should make the process easier, not harder!

I went through the interview as I always do, but I found several situations that did not look right. The H&R Block software interview and help screens did not answer my questions to my satisfaction. I ended up having to research answers at irs.gov to find H&R Block advised me incorrectly. In one case, my last year's return showed one thing, and the import showed the opposite, with the impact of under-estimating my income (and tax!) by hundreds of dollars. When I tried to work through tech support, the rep basically said ""We think it will be fixed in the next update. Wait and try again."" After the next update failed to fix the problem, I just deleted my return and started over without importing my data.

In another case, I followed the interview and the help screens where it told me ""*generally* you qualify in these cases..."". After reading the IRS publication, I found *specifically*, I didn't qualify. I never found this specific rule in the H&R Block help. I lost a sizeable chunk of money from not claiming this deduction. I hate to think of the pain of getting audited on either of these issues. I don't think H&R Block would have supported me on either of these and I would have owed $$ and penalties!

There are now free filing options available for almost all returns regardless of income (see irs.gov > e-file), my import of last year's data failed, the interview did not help me stay out of IRS publications, and I don't believe the ""worry-free audit support"" claims.

At first, we thought the H&R Block software was less buggy, and had less problems, although the user interface and interview portions are somewhat Spartan in their design.

Immediately after Efiling our 1040 return this evening, we noticed a glaring error in our HRB printed return.  The HRB software had calculated a lower refund that it should have - it opted to use the default option of the Itemized Deductions rather than the higher Standard Deduction, and our refund could have been $630 higher.  Put another way, nothing in the HRB software warned us to take the higher Standardized deduction and we missed the little check box as we passed through, and did not notice that the lower itemized deduction had been applied instead.

When I contacted HRB Support by phone this evening, they were apathetic, and did not seem to care about the problem I pointed out to them; about the obvious design flaw that should have been caught during the error check process at the end (as is the case with TurboTax by the way). I asked for the call to be escalated to a supervisor (Edwin) whose faux courtesy did little to soothe the pain that this is the first time EVER that we have had to file a 1040X Amended Return.  He REFUSED to ESCALATE my quality issue to the QC department and REFUSED to give me the contact number of the corporate office to report the problem we encountered, refused to have someone follow up by calling me tomorrow, and did not even provide a mailing address to write to the corporate office about an easy-to-fix problem, a problem that will cause us several extra hours of refiling the Amended 1040X return.  Also he refused to refund my purchase price or to honor their ""Maximum Refund Guarantee"" as detailed on their website.  Apparently, their guarantee is worthless, just pure marketing BS.

Now, I'm not an aggressive tax person by any means - I don't take any exotic deductions, exemptions or credits, and try to make it so every year I might owe a couple hundred dollars, or get a small refund.  I pay my taxes, and that's fine.  Suddenly this letter from the IRS says I owe over $2500, and can I pay it now please, thank you very much?  Well, it was inaccurate on the part of the IRS - I had the papers, the program, the file, all of it... and after hyperventilating a bit, I called the IRS.  Essentially, I was told that I couldn't take the deduction, and I kept having this circular argument with the woman, where she simply couldn't understand why I thought I could have this deduction.  Here's where the H&R Block ""Worry-free Audit Support"" people come in.

I spent 2 hours on the phone with this support guy, asking for some help in dealing with the matter.  He was polite;  He was intelligent; and he deliberately and specifically refused to provide any support at all, because it was an assessment, not an audit.  What???  What does that even mean??? For the next 2 hours, I read the fine print on their guarantee with him, and listened to him read scripted refusals about not providing a tax person to assist, a manager to speak with, a means of redress; I was told I was on my own.

So, ok, I'm on my own.  Next day, I try the IRS folks again.  Thank GOD you don't ever get the same person twice.  In 10 minutes, I had the problem fixed.  I pointed out the issue, asked if I could walk through the pertinent part of the file line by line; I got to the 3rd line and the new IRS lady says ""Oh, I see, it's that same computer problem again.  This has been happening a lot lately.  You're ok, I'm fixing it now.""  ""Wow... Ok, Thank you very much, you'll send a letter?  Thank you, thank you thank you!  Goodbye!""  No actual problem, I was right, IRS was wrong.  10 minutes on the phone.  But H&R Block's ""Worry-free Audit Support""? NOT THERE FOR YOU.

All these give wildly different results for me, from a $386 with MFS, to a $2068 refund filing MFS.  You also have to change the assumptions inside the MFS to figure different ways, such as which parent gets assigned our one child, which changed from $1790 to $2068, but only after lots of trial and error, and with a terrible interface and no help from this program.

I went to the IL state sight after I did my taxes so I could eFile my state for free. Glad I did because I got about $70 more back by using the free software available there.

However, a deal came along for this software, so I decided to give it a try.  Maybe I'm spoiled by Turbotax, or lacking a handful of degrees that might have helped me, but I found this software unwieldy to navigate, use, and understand.  It asked for some irrelevant details that Turbotax never required and that would have been overly time consuming to acquire.  I was frustrated right out of the gate... and stayed there.  I never even made it to the state form, as I ultimately figured out that the frustration level to continue plodding through it was not worth the loss of the money I had already paid.  I quit the program and went right back to Turbotax.  Live and learn!",Not For Me!
3199,1,H&R Block,139.866666666667,"02 5, 2011","This is the first year I have tried the H&R Block program.  I was tired of the Intuit games with their TurboTax program - in all the years I used TurboTax, I NEVER received a promised rebate and the State filing fees were getting out of hand.  There were other unexpected charges too, but this review isn't the forum for that.

I decided to try H&R Block's software for a change even though I liked TurboTax.  H&R Block was much easier to use for those who enjoy the step-by-step walk-through.  In many ways, the explanation of the tax codes for decision points people reached were very easy to understand.  It even took the TurboTax files form the previous year and flawlessly transferred the data to H&R Block's software for this year's return.

The one major flaw in this software is when one makes an itemized list for a field, the list can not be edited or even reopened once closed.  Every time I tried to bring up an itemized list from any field, the program would crash with the dreaded ""H&R Block quit unexpectedly"" error.  All data entered after the previous save was lost.  This was very frustrating as there is no way to edit an itemized list once added.  This was an every time event - no matter which field I entered an itemized list for - I even started an entirely new return to see if that would fix it.  It didn't.  I then went to the web site and found no way to provide feedback on the issue.  There was no support area for this either.  The only support areas were for tax questions and installation issues.  I had to revert to using Excel for my itemized lists to add things up before entering the final number in the proper tax field.  This software bug cost H&R Block two stars.  Other than that, it appeared to be a good software package - on par with TurboTax but without the Intuit hidden cost issues.

Update: Attempted to access the forms directly.  I opened the 1040 with no problem, but when I tried to access a link to another form, the wrong form kept popping up (tried to access Form 8863 (American Opportunity Credit) and instead it opened Form 8812 (Additional Child Tax Credit).  And when a field is selected, the form jumps around.  H&R Block sent me a link to a new, improved version.  All the same issues remained in the newest version.  Lowered to Two Stars.

Update 2: Decided I had enough of the buggy program and wanted to return it.  Found the 60-day guarantee, but no way to submit for it.  Called H&R Block to obtain a refund.  After about 20 minutes of looking on their database, the customer service representative said she could find no way to refund the money and that I needed to contact Amazon for the refund, but Amazon won't refund on a downloaded piece of software.  After 40 minutes on the phone, information was taken and H&R Block said they would elevate it to the next level.  I am now waiting for a phone call back.  Although very nice on the phone, the H&R Rep was clueless.  Rating now one-star - wish there was a zero star rating.","Many Bugs, Bad Customer Service"
3200,1,H&R Block,139.866666666667,"11 17, 2013","If I could give it zero stars I would. When I went from Turbo Tax to Tax Cut, the software automatically read your computer and imported your data from the prior year. I think H&R Block must have purchased Tax Cut because I didn't see Tax Cut available anymore. This software (H&R Block) does not give you any instructions at the beginning on how to import your prior year data so I simply started entering my numbers for the current year. At a certain point, I realized you had to KNOW TO IMPORT YOUR DATA BY MANUALLY CHOOSING TO DO SO FROM A MENU ON THE BAR ACROSS THE TOP. I saved my file and then discovered when you try to import then, the software wipes out everything you entered for the current year. The programmers could have written the program to import only last years data without erasing any entries in the current year columns but I guess H&R Block's management didn't care about the customers' convenience.

After I completed my tax returns, H&R Block asked for a customer review of the software program. After I wrote a detailed review of what happened, surprise, surprise I got an email saying my review did not meet with their review criteria.

I looked up tax tables from two sources and found them identical.  Using that table I calculated my tax using a calculator, and also Microsoft Excel.  The results were identical and $5 lower than H&R Block calculated.  I could find no way to e-mail Block except by paying them $19.95, so I called them to ask why this would be.  When I got through the phone tree, the man said that type of question had to go to their ""digital group""? and he transferred me to a lady, who I assume was off-shore.  Getting through the language barrier, I think she understood my question.  She told me she needed to check, and put me on ""hold music"".  After about a half hour, the music disconnected and I was left unconnected to Block. I have used their software for over ten years and now I wish I had checked their calculations before.

b) Then I found that if I completed a specific Arizona deduction on form 321 the program doesn't support e-filing because form 321 isn't included.

My goal was to find a product that would allow me to submit a business return electronically because I was filing in the State of New York where e-filing is required.  Filing a paper return in New York incurs a penalty from the State's Tax office.  In reviewing the material the product indicated it supported e-filing and no where prior to the filing step in the product does it inform you that the business forms cannot be e-filed.  I think it is terribly dishonest to advertise this product as one that allows you to e-file when in fact there is no support for e-filing business returns.  The primary reason for purchasing this product is to leverage the business return capabilities, and it should be clearly noted that the business product does not support e-file.

1) E-file could not be completed for business returns due to the K-1 bug previously mentioned.  Not only that, printed forms were watermarked with 'Draft' making physically filing with the work of the software impossible.

2) H&R Block 2010 information did not import properly into 2011 for personal returns.

3) Exchanging the .ATX file for a business return in H&R Block 2011 with a business partner resulted in errors.  We were unable to share the .ATX file.  These errors could not be resolved with numerous and lengthy support sessions with H&R Block customer service.  In the past, we were simply able to pass the ATX file between us for editing.

4) On my personal return, adding two Schedule K-1s (owning multiple businesses) resulted in mysterious excess tax (large amount) regardless of reported income (I even fictitiously edited a second K-1 to show a loss instead of income and it still resulted in this increased tax).  I actually spent the time to input everything I had in 2011 back into the old 2010 version.  The 2010 version calculated things properly whereas 2011 included this mysterious tax.  Again, H&R Block customer service could not help resolve this.

After encountering these issues, I switched to TurboTax.  TurboTax 2011 worked much better.  I was able to have multiple K-1s on my personal return, e-filing was no problem, and TurboTax imported my old H&R Block 2010 file better than H&R Block 2011 did.

After install them, yes I can open the T10 file now. But What I truly need is view my business return! Bang! There is no way to let the reinstalled Business application to open the file previously saved. Sounds odd? True.
The one funny thing of the Business Software is, there is a screen let you open saved returns, but no Browse button. Because of that, I lost all my business data (I still have the prints) I have to reenter them. My recommendation is stay away from H&R Block Premium and Business version. Not worth the trouble down on the road. You may end of losing data if you ever reinstalled your software.

I downloaded from Amazon the Premier +Efile +State. ($79.99 USD) I updated the program. I completed the 1065 Partnership return.  Then I brought up the personal 1040 and filled it all out.  I got to the end of the return to efile it and it will not let me - it states that the Schedule K-1 is a DRAFT form and I cannot e-file yet.

I visited the H&R Block Website and looked at their list of approved forms, and it shows that the form had been approved by the IRS.  I went to the IRS website, and I do not find any mention that the Sch K-1 1065 is being held up for any reason.  I manually downloaded the approved form at H&R's site. Installed and rebooted the computer.  No Go - same Issue.

Called H&R support - spent 3 hours - 3 HOURS - on the phone with someone who sounded like I just woke them up.  This person tried brushing me off and telling me I would just have to mail the return in, that e-filing would not work for me.  WHAT KIND OF SUPPORT IS THAT????  L-A-Z-Y!!!

I asked them, ""So you are telling me, that EVERYONE using your software who files a Sch K-1 from a 1065 or S Corp is going to have to file their returns via mail, that they won't be able to file electronically?  Does the IRS know about this issue with your software?  She finally put a manager on with me, and all I got was, ""Well, we are still working on the software!""

So, everyone - you are using a BETA version for your tax software?????

Tried updating the program, looked at all the forms in the software - Not one one of the Sch K's had the word DRAFT printed across them - they were all dated correctly. Everything looked good. Rebooted the machine - did everything I could think of to make it work.  No Go.

Called H&R back that afternoon, hoping to get someone who had a brain pan larger than a gnat's.  Did talk to someone who told me - after spending an hour of putting me on hold, then off hold, then on hold, ad-nauseaum  (with the worst music in the world blaring in my ear!) that there would be another update coming.

As well, this program is flawed. When you enter your previous years refund, the program automatically enters it in as an estimated tax paid(usually requiring a form IT-560) on your state taxes.

I had about a couple of dozen items with capital gains and losses. While the data could be imported from Fidelity, I had to go through reviewing each item in my final check, even if there were no errors.

I finally could file my return, and although it Tax Cut had checked for all errors, it got rejected. Upon rejection, I had to pay $19.99 for my Federal return extenstion.

Also, technical support people try to be helpful but they aren't competent. They don't listen. They don't answer basic questions like ""Is your server up or down?"" They give responses like it's raining so maybe that's the problem with the server.

This was the first year I used this software. I bought it because, on sale, it was a better deal than TurboTax. I'm filing in two states this year. Federal and one state worked fine, but the software would not properly process my Maryland return. Essentially, it does not acknowledge Local (Baltimore City) tax withholding from your W-2. As a result, these taxes are calculated as owed rather than paid, and the final values the software calculates are much higher than they should be.

I wasted a few hours of my own time trying to figure this out. Then talked to customer service for another two hours only to be told there was nothing they could do. I'd really like my Sunday back.

I had an extremely similar situation a few years ago with TurboTax.

Pros: Generally works correctly. Has most needed forms.

Cons: the Jump to input feature dead ends often. This is incorrect and was poorly programmed.  The way it is supposed to work is, certain fields are meant to be greyed out so as to force input from a worksheet or supporting schedule.  so you right click the cell and Jump to the source.  There you do the input, and the program carries the result to the form being filed. OK when it works. But many times, too many times a greyed out field says that there is no source input.  Very frustrating. Minus 2 stars for that.
Worse, this year I had the unpleasant experience of finding a field whose source is an incorrect link.  Minus one star for that.
I attempted to report it thru the free customer support chat.  The one answering the phone was not competent to assist.  Worse, when I asked for a supervisor, she claimed to be a supervisor.  It took a long time to get her to the point where she acknowledged she was out of her depth and put on a supervisor. Who said I would be called back within 48 hours. I was, but the person responding said I would have to be called back by software development, again in not more than another 48 hours. Another star off for staffing customer support with non-competent staffers. A cynic could suspect that the software is designed to drive business to the H&R  Block offices.
Follow up: When ""Software Development"" returned my call it was to tell me they couldn't fix it this year, they would fix it next year!!!  They also had no record of other problems except the mis-link, that I spent additional time discussing with them. Another 2 stars off. I told the developer his company's response was inadequate and that I would be switching to Turbo Tax next year.  I will probably switch this year. TT has only 20% 1 & 2 star reviews, this has 25% bad reviews.

Another problem: the help system is very un-user friendly. It should recognize the cell you are working on and take you to the help for that specific topic. instead it brings you to the general screen telling you how to use the help overall.  Minus another star, especially in a long developed product like this one.
The help does not have enough topics or ways of getting to the topic you need. you have to word it exactly as in the help index or it gets you nothing. OK for 1999, ,unsatisfactory for 2012.  another star off for that. OOPs, no stars left.

For NY schedule C filers: no IT-202S, the simple version of the UBT form. Only the long form. minus another star. Negative stars!

I am sad to write this review as I used to like this product. The Customer support person said they did not want to lose me as a customer, but that is probably just talk. If they want to keep me, they should specifically address each point I have raised here with a proper remediation. fOLLOW UP:See my follow up above.

Pros:
1. Cheap.

Cons:
1. Un-intuitive questions.

2. Astounding inability handling complex Tax situation, this is the deal killer. I got non-deductible IRA contribution in 2010 and convert to ROTH IRA, which TT correctly identify the 1099R amount to be not taxable. On the other hand in this topic H&R eventually give me a message 'Your tax return has no covered distribution' Huh? Oh yeah you bet I had exhausted all the answer combination in H&R, and I am not a newbie to the TAX software.

3. Poor choices. Instead of the higher Tax credit American Opportunity Credit, H&R suggest my family take the lower Life time learning Credit. I don't know the reason behind it. But again I had triple checked same information were used in TT & H&R.

4. Calculation errors abound. My 1099-B profit is grossly wrong in H&R. Yes again I triple checked them and used a calculator too. Same information TT got the right number H&R does not. It's just a simple add up of each transaction's loss and profits, I don't get it why H&R still mess up.

The program asks that you choose your state then installs and asks you to update. Once I continued with the state (Massachusetts) return, I soon realized that ALL OF MY DATA was gone!. There is no other saved copy anywhere on my computer. The Block support is via online chat. Here is their response: ""Timothy H.: Okay. Unfortunately we do not have any way to recover the data that may have been lost. All we can say is to re-enter the information and save it again, and make sure when you save that it does not overwrite any previously saved entries. We apologize for this issue, and value you as our customer.""

So how do I make sure it does not overwrite saved entries? Am I a Block programmer? It's almost comical, except that I spent hours entering data.

By the way, the chat asks for some info as you enter the session, including your product and tax year. Here it is Feb 16 and there is no option to choose tax year 2011.

Sloppy, makes you wonder how many more errors are within the calculations. I can no longer trust the company. I have used this software for years (before Tax Cut became H&R Block) and am saddened that the quality control has gone downhill.",Did Block Test This Bad Software?
3267,1,H&R Block,47.8666666666667,"02 15, 2012","I give 1 to this product. Here is why:

I used 2010 version before. This time I used 2011 H&R Block Home Deluxe+State running on Windows 7. When I run MA state tax return I found the tax return was surprising lower. So I printed out MA FORM-1 and found the line  13 'Number of dependents ... under 12' was blank that missed $3600 deduction. The state program pull dependent information from Fed program. It should not miscalculate it. I went back to check the information in Fed tax return and couldn't find any problem. I checked the Update status all programs were up to date. I called H&R Block support and was told there was no known issue with MA program. I saved the data and closed the program and restarted it and then checked the dependent information again. there was ! displayed on each dependent line which I saw it when I started Fed program and I had removed it by editing the lines. I edited each dependent line and 'removed' the ! again. after that I noticed the MA tax return changed. I went to state program and saw the line 13 had the number as it should be there.

Apparently it is a 'unknown' and unforgivable bug. it almost caused big loss to me. I am not sure if I should manually check the tax return result next time using the program. Note: I am a very experienced software engineer.",There is a unforgivable bug in MA state program

3270,1,H&R Block,47.8666666666667,"02 10, 2012","My complaint is poor technical support for state tax forms. On our Montana state return, the software would not allow me to enter some spouse income (Additions to Income, federal tax refund). When I tried, the program would switch to 'filing status: single,' and the spouse boxes would gray out and accept no input.

A software bug, and probably easily fixable by a programmer familiar with the program. But there is no way to send an e-mail to describe a technical problem. The HR Block home and customer service pages have no e-mail link at all. Instead, you must call and you get funneled to a general customer service rep. After 15 agonizing minutes with the rep and her supervisor, it was clear neither had any knowledge of the Montana state software or tax law, and did not even understand the problem, let alone know the answer. Then I was put on hold and disconnected. With no e-mail link, I would have had to call back and start from scratch again with a service rep that didn't know the program. Instead, I opted to run off hard copy (most of the return was correct), make the necessary final calculations by hand, and fill out a return by hand with corrected entries. In other words, I had to do the work that I paid Block to do.

Addendum: to print the hard copy, I inserted some dummy numbers toward the end, just to get to the 'print forms' button. When I got there, the automatic error-check gave me a cheerful: ""No errors found!"" This was though the return understated income by several hundred dollars and was in conflict with the federal data. Not reassuring.

Next year, TurboTax.",Poor technical support for bugs
3271,1,H&R Block,47.8666666666667,"02 9, 2012","For OS-X users, if you install this on a case-sensitive file system, it will not work due to incompetent programming and lack of testing. For example, it will say it can't find file ADJUST.cxml, but the file is really named Adjust.cxml. So I rename the file to ADJUST.cxml, and at a later step it complains that it can't fine Adjust.cxml; dumb. My fix is to create a case-insensitve disk image and install there.

After completing the Federal form, and downloading the State package, the program won't let me continue. A dialog pops up stating that the software must be updated (I did apply one update already). The ""update"" is of size 0.00MB, and available February 28 2012 (a date in the future). The options are Cancel or Update at this point, but the Update button is grey (not choosable), so Cancel. The end result is that I can't continue on to the State return.

Customer support's answer is to wait for the update, but can't confirm that the update is really going to happen or why the software wants to do an update that has a future date. As of today (02/09/2012), there is one Federal update available on the H&R Block Web site (the same as the one installed by the program), and no State updates. H&R Block is essentially using the 0MB update to force you to wait for the real update. It would be nice to be able to start the State return and just be warned.

There are many other bugs in the software, mostly annoying. The help screen usually ends up empty, some screen redraws aren't correct, and it crashed once for me.

Have any other OS-X users completed the State return?

UPDATE: The 02/28/2012 update came out, and I installed it. However, the software still won't let me continue on to the state portion, still insisting that an update is required. This time the update box, in the ""Expected Availability"" column says ""None Planned"", but I still can't continue to the state. I've tried this program one two computers and the same thing happens, so all I can conclude is that there is some serious bug that H&R Block hasn't fixed.

Stay away from this program. Based on the other comments about miscalculations, missing forms, etc. there is no trusting this program to even do what it is supposed to do.

I have used the  HR Block online version since 2008 but decided to try the PC version for 2011.  The production information talks about being able to import prior year tax information from HR Block, Turbo Tax and other sources but it wasn't until I installed the software that I discovered this list doesn't include their own online version.  I confirmed this with HR Block customer service.

Amazon will not accept a return on this item even though I bought it less than a hour ago so this leaves we with a couple of unsatisfactory options; continue with the PC version and lose continuity in my tax records, pay HR Block a second time so I can use the online version OR switch to a new tax package and still pay twice for 2011.  All are poor options that could have been avoided if they would have said you can't import from the inline version.

UPDATE: Just when things couldn't get worse... I got a letter from the IRS, telling me I owed them another $985 for 2011. How could this be???

This is the first time I've experienced a real software failure - and it relates to filing multiple states.  First, the company charges way too much for the second state - $40 if I remember correctly.

Then, when putting in your W-2 into the system as filed with the IRS, your state returns will count the income on your W-2 twice.  So if you made $50k and note two states where the income was taxed, the software doubles the income amount to $100k on both of your tax returns.

I spent 2 hours on the phone with HR Block tech support.  The first one hung up on me after 20 minutes because he couldn't figure it out.  Maybe his call center stats looked bad.  The second gentleman, who was very nice, actually replicated the problem on his end.  He said he had never seen the software do that, but provided a case ID and was looking into it.  He suggested that I contact the HR Block tax help - just a small (ha ha ha) $20 fee to ask 1 question.

So I contacted the HR Block tax ""professional"" via their messaging system and here's the question I wrote:

I am using HR Block @ Home Deluxe.  I am a ""state1"" resident working in ""state2"". My W-2 includes a box 15 / 16 / 17 for both ""state1"" and ""state2"".

Box 16 for both ""state1"" and ""state2"" are the same amount - these amounts match box 1 - total Federal Wages. I have withholdings for box 17 in both states.

When I enter both states into the W2 entry screen and put wages into box 16 of both states - my state returns double the amount of income that I actually had. As an example, if I had box 1 wages of 50,000 and I enter 50,000 in box 16 for ""state1"" and 50,000 in box 16 for ""state2"", my ""state1"" and ""state2"" returns show total income of 100,000.

If I show the wages only related to 1 state, the software does not allow me to file electronically.

So how do I properly report my wages for my state returns, and how do I get the software to recognize the proper way to treat the income so it isn't doubled on my state returns.

Thank you.

and here was their most excellent response:  Name hidden to protect the not so innocent...

I can't see your return as you are using an at home version. What you need to do is file a ""state2"" non resident return and a ""state1"" resident return. Prepare the nonresident state first so the income flows properly. It shouldn't be doubling the income - it should just be reporting what your wages were - whatever your amount in box 17 is.
You may have to exclude the income if you can't figure out how to get it off your return any other way.
See if everything still transfers over correctly.

Returns with multiple states are complex. If you are unsure of the accuracy of your return you can use H and R Block's Best of Both program. With Best of Both you prepare the return then send it to a tax professional for review and filing. I would be honored to provide that service for you. If you would like, you can request me as the tax advisor for review of the return.

I had imported my return information from last year, completed my return for this tax year, and passed all the error checking.  When I attempted to file my return electronically, another error checking software routine would not let me file the return.  I contacted customer service via their chat feature.  I was told they had a programming error and I would have to re-do my entire return and I would have to start the process by not importing my information from last year's return.  I opted to print out my returns and mail them in instead since I wasn't going to spend another couple of hours going through the software interview process and data entering protocols to redo the return with no certainty that another error would still prevent me from filing the returns electronically.  I wrote H&R Block and requested a full refund since their product was faulty and prevented me from filing my returns electronically, one of the key reasons for why I purchased their product.

I had a very complicated tax year in 2011 - being unemployed, selling my house, moving out of state, selling stock, rolling over IRA money, hundreds and hundreds of items donated to charity, etc. The H&R Block software was very good about stepping me through all that, and even though I spent HOURS (like 40+) on getting all the information inputted correctly it seemed to go smoothly, and as I made changes the whole form would get updated. I finally had something that looked correct and went to fill in my state form, but after I had done so I realized I had made a mistake on my federal schedule D form. I went in and corrected it, and my federal income tax changed - but the state remained the same. I went in to the state form but it had no way to modify the capital gains field and said it was imported from the federal. I looked at the actual form and saw it had the old value, before I made my correction.

I wanted to do the state over again. But to make a long story short - you can't. I finally called H&R Block customer support and was told there is *NO WAY* to delete or change your state return once it gets filled in, and the ONLY WAY to get it to pick up the correct data on the Federal Return is to DELETE THE ENTIRE FEDERAL RETURN and start the entire process all over again from scratch.

This is totally insane and ludicrous. As you fill out your federal form and make changes it keeps updating all the forms. Are you telling me the software can't handle this for the state form either? As one whose professional field was software for 36 years I can tell you if I designed a program like that I would have probably been fired. Well I guess I'm the one ""firing"" H&R Block.

It incorrectly calculated my EIC amount, because it insists that because I am not a real-estate professional, I must be considered a ""passive"" rental property owner.

It incorrectly said that I should take the tuition tax deduction (for a gain of $21) rather than the Lifetime Learning Credit (for a gain of $42).

3) Because I bought it on Amazon I do not get free access to their advertised support. It says it requires a Key that you only get if you buy the product from H&R's website, so there is no way to access support for this worthless product without paying ANOTHER $20 just for the support. Crazy.

But for some unknown reason to us, upon completion of filing our return it would not allow us to submit our e-file!!  We attempted to e-file it multiple times before the April 15th deadline with no success!

Let me back up...

First off, since we purchased this through Amazon we should not have had to pay a second time once it came time to complete and e-file our return, but it kept telling us to bay the $53.15 or gave us the option to print and snail mail it in.  When we purchased and downloaded the software from Amazon, it supplied us with a Key Code to enter, which would have prevented us from having to pay, but that Key Code would not take.  I tried to manually enter it in, and then copied and pasted it in, and even kept it case sensitive to exactly as it read, but no matter what it simple would not take.  So we ended up paying the $53.15 on our debit card and even after that the 'submit' option to e-file would not take!!  And no, in case you are wondering it is not a matter of something being wrong on our hardware (Laptop) because we also worked on trying to e-file with our desktop computer too-- no luck.  Needless to say I quickly printed our Return and dropped it in the mail box, though it will be one day late thanks to H&R Block!  There were a couple of other quirks with the software, but for now I can not recall what those were.

3384,1,H&R Block,161.32,"02 22, 2013","****UPDATE!!!:

This is one botched piece of software. There was an Arizona update tonight. Yay! Sounds like they finally fixed the problem of correctly transposing the numbers from Federal Schedule A to Arizona Schedule A. Nope. Not a chance. This company is fully aware there's a major problem with the Arizona module. They either don't know how to fix it, or they refuse to fix it. How do I know there are numerical errors in H&R Block's software this year? I ran the exact same tax return on 4 other major tax software providers.

Again.......the sad reality is that Arizona is broken. Block either doesn't know how to, or won't fix it.

Block appears to be inept. For that reason, I strongly recommend you save yourself time, $$$, and lots of grief. Don't buy this useless piece of garbage. It's that simple.

Whoever ""handled"" the Arizona module should be the hapless target in a farting contest starring Rosie O'Donnell and Louie Anderson. H&R Block turned this into a completely useless piece of software for me. Just some of the problems I found. I'm sure there are many, many more!!!:

1. Software incorrectly imports data from Federal ""Schedule A"" to Arizona ""Schedule A"". I told them about it, by way of phone and chat. No updates. No one has fixed it. How could all the others get it right and H&R Block get it so very wrong? And why do they not jump on fixing broken software? Why would they want to professionally embarrass themselves? Their lack of attention and overt laziness makes me embarrassed for them.

2. Critical forms for Arizona are missing (form 321, ""Credit for Contributions to Charities That Provide Assistance to the Working Poor"".) Try getting credit for what you've donated there, without having your return rejected. I dare ya.

3. Software was stupidly set up to not recognize the 4th installment of Arizona state estimated taxes, so that when you check for errors, it always comes up as an error.

This year for kicks, I ran the same tax return on H&R Block, Turbotax, Taxact, OLT online, and FreeTaxUSA. The cheapest, (at only $9.95 for state) was FreeTaxUSA. Interestingly.......FreeTaxUSA was also the ONLY one that got all the correct forms organized for state. Taxact may have it right too, but I didn't pay for the state result, so I don't know.

Here's what I do know:

1. H&R Block tax software seems to be supremely screwed up.

2. Turbotax is awfully good, but very pricey. If you need to do numerous returns though, it would be the bargain of the bunch when you do the math.

3. FreeTaxUSA is the new very, very good and very reasonably priced tax software, at only $9.95 for state, including free e-file for both federal and state. Federal is free. It's the 2nd year I've used it. It's remarkably good, but the $9.95 charge only covers 1 return.

4. If you hunt around, you can find a discount price of only $11.90 for Taxact (for 1 return......federal & state, & free federal and state e-file, after you cough up your $11.90. Just Google for that $11.90 price!)Taxact is fairly wonderful. Just as (if not more!) wonderful is FreeTaxUSA. And FreeTaxUSA is about $2 cheaper than Taxact's $11.90 discounted price. This bargain (hidden!) online price is only good for 1 return.

5. If you only need Federal and/or you can figure out the state on your own.......FreeTaxUSA and Taxact are both free for federal. Both are excellent. If you don't need the stuff in Taxact's ""Deluxe"" version, then don't buy it. Most folks don't need it. If you need charitiable donation software........go to TurboTax's ""It's Deductible"". It's online, and it's free, folks.

It's clear and apparent to me, that this year (actually I've had major challenges with H&R Block's software in the past!) the software seems to have been written by aged chimpanzees smoking large quantities of crack. Really, really powerful crack. Buyer be extremely aware!!! With the glitches, oversights, incorrectly written and allegedly coordinated (but not really!) federal and state programs, I simply could not be more adamant in NOT recommending H&R Block. However.......if you're a masochist and very much enjoy banging your head against a wall.......for you, this would be PERFECT!!!","For me, a total and complete fail:-("
3385,1,H&R Block,161.32,"02 21, 2013","The H&R Block Software has a bug/limitation so that you are unable to e-file if you were given an Identity Protection PIN from the IRS.

The IRS issued me (and 250,000 other people) an Identity Protection PIN to use when I submit my 2012 Tax Return.  The H&R Block Software allows you to enter this PIN and it is used to fill in the appropriate field on your 1040 Form, but it is not used when you attempt to e-file.  On the Electronic Signature Requirements you have 3 options but none apply to submitting using the Identity Protection PIN.
 1. Yes - I have my 2011 AGI or PIN.  (This option does not work because my 2011 AGI and PIN are compromised due to someone else submitting a 2001 return using my social security number.  This is why the IRS sent me a Identity Protection PIN.  When I use this option the IRS rejects my Tax Return saying that the AGI or PIN does not match!)
 2. Yes - I received an Electronic Filing PIN from the IRS. (Can't use this option because the Electronic Filing PIN (5-digits) is different from the Identity Protection PIN (6 digits).
 3. No - I need to print and mail my return. (My only option at this point.)

An hour and fifteen minutes wasted on 2 of their support reps.  Their solution was to request an Electronic Filing PIN from the IRS website.  The trouble is, if you were a victim of Identity Theft you are not eligible to request one, because the IRS already sent you a special Identity Protection PIN to use.

3386,1,H&R Block,161.32,"02 20, 2013",".
I haven't noticed any mention of this in the other reviews, so I'll mention it here.  My version of the ""H&R Block At Home 2012 Deluxe Federal"" edition has a bug that as of February 18th has not been fixed, although I was told a fix was forthcoming.

The bug deals with an error in the software update process, such that the software update appears to process correctly, yet each time I start the program it again asks to perform the update I just completed.  When I called H&R Block on Feb 11th to ask what's happening, the Customer Service Representative I spoke with said this was an ""update loop"" problem.  He said it was a known problem and that a program ""patch"" was being prepared and would be available at the end of the week.

Well, the week passes and on Feb 18th I start the program and it tells me a new update is available.  Great, I think, the patch the rep told me about is here.  Ah, foolish optimism!

The new update exhibits the same problem -- the update is processed completely but each time I start the program it tells me that the update is available and must be processed.  And a message is displayed on the opening page of the program that says ""Next expected update January 10th"".  Well, it's now the middle of February and still no final IRS forms.

Argh!  So even though my data has been entered and the return is compete, it can't be transmitted because H&R Block says some of the IRS forms are still ""not final.""  Because of this, and in spite of the two updates I applied, H&R Block won't ship the return to the IRS.

I call H&R Block a second time and speak to different Customer Representative and explain the problem a second time.  He says they know of no ""update loop"" problem and my description of what is happening is unknown to them.  I try to explain that I'm screwed -- all my data has been entered and my return is complete, but H&R Block's version of the IRS forms is ""not final.""  And their updates won't process.  What can I do?  Not much, actually, if I stick with H&R Block.  After some discussion of possible things I might try, including a re-install and re-entry of my data, the representative offers to refund the money I paid for the software.  I quickly accept.

What to do now?  I get back on Amazon and order the corresponding tax package from TurboTax.

No problem entering my data into TurboTax and completing the return.  No problem with IRS forms not being final.  Frankly, it took me more time to install TurboTax -- and their required "".Net Framework 4"" Microsoft application -- than it did to re-enter my data and finish my federal tax return.

So, even though it cost me seven dollars more for TurboTax, I'm happy.  I'm very close to being out of Tax Preparation Hell.  If I have any problems e-filing my TurboTax-completed return to the IRS, I'll post it here.

Otherwise, next year it's TurboTax for me.

----> Update: Wed, Feb 20th:
The IRS has accepted my E-filed return prepared by Turbotax. Hooray!

----> Update: Sat, Feb 23rd:
H&R Block refund has not hit my credit card account, so I call H&R Block again.  Rep says he can find no record of my call on Feb 18th.  (I can see where this is going.)  I explain my problem again.  Rep attempts to issue the refund but system rejects it because it's more than 60 days after purchase date.  But, I now have a Case Number.  He says he will escalate the issue and somone will call me within 48-72 business hours.  This technique is known as ""burying it in the bureaucracy."" I think my cat does the same thing.  My hope for the promised refund is beginning to fade.

----> Update: Sat, Mar 2nd:
A customer rep from HR Block called today to say they had scheduled the repayment of my purchase price and that it would appear on my credit card account sometime the week of March 4th.  If it actually shows up, I'll report here.

----> Update: Mon, Mar 11th:
Still no refund on my credit card.  It's a week past when they said it would show up.  I've lost all trust in this company.  Granted, it's the middle of the tax prep season and things might get missed.  But how hard is it to override a program refusal to process a single refund?  I worked 38 years in software programming and I know it can be done.  Anyway, at this point I have given up and expect I will never see my refund.  I hope it helps H&R Block's bottom line this year, because next year it won't.

(BTW, this is my second attempt to add the Mar 11th update to the Amazon review.  Perhaps I ran afoul of the ""review guidelines.""  I've reviewed other products in Amazon and always felt my comments were within the bounds of good taste, as I believe the earlier update here was.  But if I did overstep the bounds, shouldn't someone at least have told me how or why it was refused?)

----> Final Update, Mar 18th:
Bank account still shows no credit card refund from H&R Block.  So, I call H&R Block again and speak to a pleasant lady who placed me on hold for a brief time and then came back on the line to assure me the credit refund had been issued to my bank.  She said they could call the bank and check on it for me.  I said, No, they'd done enough to me already and that I was done with them. (I am left to wonder how my original credit card purchase at H&R Block made it into my charge account very quickly, while the refund transaction seems stuck in hell.)  I told her to forget the whole issue and to close the case number with the comment that the customer is very upset, has lost all trust in H&R Block and will forever after use TurboTax or anyone else in the business except H&R Block.  I'm sick of hearing lame, ""My dog ate my homework"" and ""The check is in the mail"" excuses.  They can keep the miserable $32 and change.  It's no longer worth my time to drag through this sort of runaround.

All of you have been warned.  Patronize H&R Block at your peril.

Knowing I had to buy extra states because I was I partial year resident in a few states, so I bought extra copies of the software on sale, but this did not help at all because there is no way to enter product keys when you get to the point in the software to buy a state.
And another thing is you buy a state and then have to pay again if you want to e-file.
The last issue is I just moved to New Hampshire and put this into the software and it had me buy New Hampshire. But after I had bought NH, I found out that NH has no income tax and unless you have a lot of investment income, you do not need to file at all. No where in the software did it even mention this fact and happily took my money to buy that state just and is still prompting me to file.
 And the software never prompted me to buy Vermont where I work in, and never gave me any warning of not doing Vermont at all until I tried to buy Vermont and then the message was that this software does not support this situation. The software should protect you from not filling and it failed to do so badly.
The whole point of getting tax software is to handle situations where you have part year resident and non-resident living in one state and working in another.

I had spent 4 hours filling in my return info, for state & fed return, and my entries had passed all the hurdles and I was up to the point ready to e-file both together.

I was presented with a screen to print the returns, so I figured that was a good idea, so I tired to use Adobe Acrobat 9 to save the files as PDF. (It worked in previous years, but not this time)
It would not work with the fed return, so I tried the state return, and the H&R Block software locked up. It would not let me do anything more.

I had to have windows close the program, and when it did, I was asked to save the return, sounded like a good idea, so I did. (Wrong again) When I tired to reopen the return, the data was corrupted and unusable, (file length 0). I called support, and there was nothing they could do.

Apparently they do not generate backup files for our data, so any glitch and you loose everything.

I suggest if you use this software, save your returns under a new name each time you save, at least you will have more than I do right now.

Can I deduct 4 wasted hours of my life on my return?

3457,1,H&R Block,81.32,"03 13, 2014","I purchased this software because I'm a lifelong resident of the Kansas City metro area and wanted to support a local company and was able to get a competitive price on this software compared to Turbo Tax. I'm so disappointed in the support for this product that not only will I be trying to return the software (which may now be impossible) but I will never deal with H&R Block again and will use only their competitors software in the future.

In the end this is what H&R Block could do to fix my federal return stuck in ""pending"" status:
- cannot tell me why my Federal e-file return is still stuck in ""pending"" and can't tell me what the IRS would do or what my liability is if that return later gets transmitted after I've filed a paper return
- they can't call someone (presumably a tax professional works there somewhere) in their own organization to ask what happens if the e-file gets transmitted after filing on paper
- they can't call the people that work on the service cases to find out what the problem actually is and why they've never bothered to call or email me with any response
- they can't refund my purchase price for the software because I bought it on Amazon (by the way I can't get a refund on Amazon because I foolishly bought this seasonal tax software product in January and waited for the software updates before attempting to file; a good reason not to buy software for taxes from anyone on-line unless you're buying in in April)
- can't arrange for me to work with a local HR Block office at no charge although I'm free to pay the regular Block office fees to have someone there try to press a button and finish submitting the ""pending"" e-file (my mistake was thinking that having a local presence would be an edge over competitor's such as TurboTax but apparently their software division is a completely separate company so there's nothing to differentiate them from other software companies)
- they can't .... Well I could go on but you get the idea; essentially I may as well have called my mother instead of their support center, at least I'd have felt loved at the end.

Another item to note: I was told by the support person I spoke with the Federal e-file part of this software is actually ""free"" (in spite of the box saying you get up to 5-free which implies they're charging for additional e-files) and they give no guarantee that they can be used.

In case you want to know, here are the details of my case:
I received the software and it installed with no problem. I e-filed 1 federal return for my partner without problem but when e-filing my return it was a different story. I received a confirmation of transmittal email but shortly thereafter another email that there was a problem and was instructed to call a number for assistance.

When I called that number it was the data center where they attempted to manually ""push"" the return but it did not work. They then suggested that I call the support line (800-HRBLOCK) or file a paper return.

When I called their support they could do nothing but open a service case because it had to be sent to group that actually works on the issue and was told I would be contacted within 24-hours. A day later, after not being contacted, I called the support line again and was told that the original case had been closed with notes saying they had called me; the only problem was I had not been contacted at either of the 2 phone numbers or the email address that I left.

It was then that I found out the support center can't actually contact the group that resolves the issue and their only recourse was to open yet another service case (they couldn't even reopen the first case). This time I was told it would bet 24-48 hours, so I waited until 2-days later before I had to call again since absolutely no one from Block called or emailed me, again.

When I spoke with them today they again indicated that the notes say that I was contacted but clearly that was False. After speaking with a manager I find that this support center is really just a dead-end when it comes to helping customers and is more of a customer disservice area in that they were unable to do absolutely anything at all to explain the issue, correct the situation and were unable to answer questions or allay my concerns about the legality or liability of inadvertently filing both a paper and e-file return.

It's now 4-days since I transmitted and the end result of 2-hours of calls and waiting on hold is to print out and file a paper return and hope there are no penalties or legal charges from the IRS if the transmitted but ""pending"" e-filed return happens to get unstuck and show up along with my paper return.",Buyer beware; H&R Block support can not resolve issues and will only tell you to file a paper return and waste your time

3465,1,H&R Block,81.32,"03 2, 2014","Here's a textbook case of how to destroy a customer relationship.  I've been using H&R Block's Tax Software (formerly TaxCut) since the late 1980's.  Every year I'd automatically buy the latest version, import last year's return to take advantage of not having to input SSN's, EIN's, and DOB's, and e-file my return.  So imagine my frustration after having input our income data into the 2013 version, that when I attempted to find Form 8936: Qualified Plug-in Electric Drive Motor Vehicle Credit, I found it wasn't supported in the package.  Curiously, the other Home Energy related deduction forms were included.  So there was a decision process here.

A brief search later I found all the negative reviews on Amazon I hadn't thought to read and complaints on the electric vehicle forums that if you bought one of the 8 eligible EV's, H &R Block's position is that they're considering adding the form in a future version and will refund your money.

So not only did H & R lose me as a customer for what I have to believe would have been a fairly trivial form (8 cars;  look-up the deduction) to add to their package, but you can be sure that when I see their local area storefronts, I'll think that if I ever do require the services of a tax professional, that's one place I won't be stopping.

Evidently the information entered on the federal return is supposed to be ""automatically"" entered on the state return (such as name, address, SSNs, federal AGI).  This did not happen. But the program would not allow me to enter the information -- would not bring up a screen for entering it.  I was able to bring up the state form (AZ 140) and enter ONE PIECE of information (contributions for long-term care disability insurance).  Other than that, I could not enter any information.

UPDATE:  I eventually (2 days later) received a return call from H&R Block support regarding my problem.  The man was very nice and tried everything he could think of, OVER THE COURSE OF AN HOUR AND A HALF, including having me delete my TaxCut program and re-load it from a version he emailed to me.  He was sitting at his computer and I was at mine, going step by step.  Same result for both of us -- the program could not be used to do the Arizona state tax return.  It occurs to me that perhaps the problem arose because I was using my iMac, not a PC -- however, the system requirements on the box state that it's OK to use an iMac with OS X 10.6.8, and the support technician at Block was using a Mac computer, so . . . .
In any case, I wanted to clarify that Block did not ignore me, I did receive a call-back, but there was no resolution to the problem.  I ended up doing my Arizona return manually, and it wasn't a terribly onerous task.
SECOND UPDATE:  Well, I completed my Arizona state tax return after a great deal of time going to the AZ.Gov website to obtain information on AZ income tax rules.  Doing the state tax return consumed many hours of work at my computer (counting the time I spent on the phone with H&R Block troubleshooters).  I should have been able to do the state return in fifteen minutes or so if the H&R Block program had worked properly.  During the last phone call, which lasted at least an hour and a half, nothing was resolved.  It seems to me that at the very minimum the H&R Block rep should have said, ""Well, you paid for a federal plus state return and couldn't use the state return, so we will refund you a portion of what you paid.""

There was no option to simply update by import last year's w2. I had to manually write down my employers EIN, delete last years W2 information, and add a new w2 by typing in the employer ein. Why they cannot simply read the employers EIN from last years W2 and simply update by import for this year is beyond me. Turbo Tax had no problem doing this.

Strike 2 After import, the program forced me to rearrange information in multiple boxes so that I was left with a w2 that did not match the entrys from my original w2. I believe the w2 reported on my taxes should match what my employer reported. Turbo tax did not require me to do this.

Strike 3 One of the w2s was not available for import from the employer payroll service. Turbo tax was able to import from this service so I am left to assume Tax Cut is limited in their import capabilities.

Strike 4 (I gave them one more chance) I reported rental property income last year and needed this year as well. Tax Cut imported virtually no information from schedule E of the Turbo Tax file.

However, I've been pretty disappointed.  For the most part Premium works well... it probably does a good job when it comes to preparing taxes for most people... although there were a few issues that were a little annoying, such as no data carryover from one state return to another if you file in more than one state; no provision at all for estimating a tax underpayment penalty (at least in the state of Nebraska - it just says, ""We advise you to let your state calculate it""); and no provision for filling out estimated state taxes for next year (again, at least for Nebraska - it says ""Contact your state tax authorities for forms and instructions"" - but that's why I bought this software!).  The kicker for ME though is that, if you are a minister with a housing allowance, it will not allow you to do an e-file!  It insists that you need to include a statement explaining income, expenses, and the housing allowance with Schedule SE, when the IRS rules very clearly state that such a statement is only necessary when you've got unreimbursed business expenses.  Thus, it forces you to send in a paper copy and will not allow you to e-file.  TurboTax handles this nicely.

I wish there was some way to give ZERO stars to H&R Block, this software, and especially their ""customer support"" of which there is none.

Their only answer was to offer for me to use the online version as I had opened the package I could not return it.  So using the online version I had to input all the information - losing $70 was not an option so I couldn't go to another provider.

Shame on me - I purchased the stupid software again this year and it installed beautifully and updated just as easily.  It fired right up and started with import last years data.  Yep, no way to import the online data from last year although there is NO mention of this anywhere - so back on hold for 2 hours and 20 minutes, explain what happened, put on hold for over 10 minutes figuring I would hear the dial tone at any moment - only to finally be told that there is no way to import online data into the software.

No where in the FAQ or help or anywhere is this mentioned - certainly not in the sales propaganda which states ""import last years data"".  After an exhausting time on hold and even more exhausting time talking with ""support"" I asked for my software to be converted to the online version as the price was the same.  I was told that tier 2 support would have to be involved and it would be 2 business days.

There's no effin' way I can actually CONFIRM all those details -- I have to trust Betterment. But H&R Block does not, so it will take an hour or two to do what's supposed to be ""automatic"". All of this for a total of $97 in capital gains and $5 in disallowed short sales.

The first issue I had was with one of their state programs. First, it appears that H&R Block doesn't have a downloadable state program for all 50 states, so that's an instant disappointment for anyone living in those states. Second, for some of the states that *are* supported, not all residency situations are supported. In my case, I wasn't able to file for one of the two states I was a resident in last year because part-year residency wasn't supported. That ended up botching making my other state return inaccurate since the two state returns are somewhat interdependent. The other downside that was more noticeable this year was less support for importing information from financial institutions.

Then I went on TurboTax's website to try their online web app. It was a *completely* different experience. The interface is noticeably better in terms of aesthetics and functionality. Also just like H&R Block's online web app, you can fill out all of your returns without needing to pay anything until you actually file. TurboTax was able to import data from more financial institutions than H&R Block, AND I was able to successfully fill out both of my part-year state returns with no problems at all.

Yes, TurboTax's online forms are *way* pricier, but you get what you pay for. In this case, I paid $20 for software that only got me halfway done with my tax returns, and I had to manually more data with it.

Next year I'm definitely going to fill out my returns with both H&R Block and TurboTax's online web app for free before I pay anyone to file my returns. If they both come out with the same refund/owe balances (and I'm able to complete all the returns I need to), then the only deciding factor left will be price.",State Programs are Subpar

I was sure I had not underpaid so I paid for the software and submitted the return electronically. It immediately kicked back saying the IRS wouldn't accept it, I had to print and mail my return because I did indeed owe a penalty.

Rather than print and send my return by mail with H&R Block, I decided to do a second return using TurboTax.

I worked consecutive jobs in Virginia, then Maryland last year. I also moved from Virginia to Maryland last year (funny how that works). I knew this would be a little complicated, so I decided to buy the software. I've used the H&R Block online federal service for years, and never had any problems. After downloading Maryland and going through the questionnaire process to build my return, the software said I owed taxes, interest, and penalties to Maryland for the time I lived in Virginia and worked in Maryland. This is not the case, as Maryland and Virginia have a reciprocity agreement so that wage earners do not have to pay taxes to two states on the same earnings. I tried everything I could, but I could not get the software into a situation where I answered all the questions it asked correctly and it didn't calculate the unpaid taxes and penalty. In short, it did not recognize the reciprocity agreement between Maryland and Virginia. That was annoying.

I called the H&R Block customer assistance number. Surely I was doing something wrong and someone could show me which box I neglected to click. But that 's not what happened. The man who answered, though polite enough, seemed to be limited to asking me to uninstall and reinstall the software. That was also annoying, more so because I had to hold for half an hour before I got to this non-solution. When I tried again to explain the situation to him, he told me he couldn't help with my tax question (only the software) and then referred me to a live chat service that he said could help me. After queuing in the chat room for another half hour, I was connected and explained my problem. I was immediately told that this was not the chat room I was looking for. It was that other chat room that had the tax people in it.

At that point I'd had it and signed off. I'd already wasted over an hour waiting and explaining my problem with nothing to show for it. I ended up filling out my state returns on paper and filing them (quite a few more hours work). Keep in mind--this was not a complicated filing other than the multiple states/residencies. I can't say I'll go this route again. Also, this was not on tax-eve. It was a few weeks before.

3643,1,H&R Block,87.9866666666667,"02 11, 2014","After years of trusting and being happy with TurboTax (and their awesome customer support), I decided to try H&R Block. I purchased this edition so I could easily submit both Federal and State easily (like I always did with TurboTax).

I noted after purchasing this software that there was still going to be an additional cost of $19.95 for the e-filing of State. That's fine, I just want my taxes done.

The first time I completed all of the interviewing portion of the software. I proceeded to submit the return, during which time H&R popped up with an ""Update Software"" message. I updated it, and it lost ALL of the information I had meticulously entered.

After re-entering all of the information, I hit e-file both federal and state together. I then received a confirmation for federal e-file, but not my state. Stating that I had to wait for my Federal to be accepted before I could submit my state separately.

Once my Federal was accepted, I went back to e-file my state only to have it say that  ""You can't e-file your state return because either your state or this program doesn't support it.""  I looked at all of their ""Does my state support this program"" options. ALL said AZ was good to go. So I called Customer Support.

I was on hold for 44 minutes just to have someone finally learn from his authority that the software doesn't support some of the forms that AZ uses, so it cannot e-file for AZ.

They did NOTHING for me. Just wasted my time. Now, I have to go find a printer that I trust and print off my state return (or perhaps buy a printer on Amazon). Then I have to mail it and wait. I have had minor issues with Turbo Tax in the past, they had fantastic support and always resolved issues by doing things like upgrading me for free in order to resolve certain issues. For five years I used TurboTax, never once did I have a bad experience with it.

I guess if your dealing with a state that is TOTALLY supported by their software, you'd be fine and this software would be a decent choice. However, it's hard to know for sure if they truly are supported, as it did show AZ as being supported.

Also, it would be Amazon price $34.88 + State e-file $19.95",Frustrating and a waste of time.

I am told today that the two products - online and retail PC applications can't talk to each other. I entered all my info into the on-line site ( only to find out that Free isn't Free, and they wanted to charge me $65 dollars.) So I bought the software off Amazon with a gift card and H&R block tells me I can't export the info from their on-line site to their PC based software. What gives?  So they are trying to prey on people who want to file early and maximize their refunds using a 'Free' service - but oh its not Free - you have to pay a higher fee to file via their site if you want to file any time - early or later.....  This is FALSE advertising that they say you can file for free --- my kids have 1040EZs and H&R block still charged them $15 dollars to file for federal returns and another $15 to $25 for state returns.. and OH get this you can't file the State return unless you file the Federal first... so it is all or nothing on their products.

Also the State application is available now via their on-line site, but for PC software is won't be available for another month (later February). Doesn't seem like they have their act together or they are again -- trying to sway people into paying their higher on-line fees if you want to file early... Which is always what the IRS tells people - file early and get your refunds.

My experience is similar to the other users writing in.

I thought this was a great deal compared to $150 for Turbotax's version, and $85 HR block wanted for this online.

I was wrong.

In setting up the business version, the software says forms are missing, and its necessary to update them.

Following the instructions just hangs the software.  Repeatedly.

I have a Masters in EE, and have no trouble running any other tax software.  I don't think it's something I'm doing.

Running in compatibility modes doesn't help.  Running as administrator doesn't help.

I found it to be slow to install and use. The user interface and many of the components look as if they haven't been updated since Windows 95.

The only reason I bought it was because I had the misfortune of using this software last year, and figured it would save me time to continue using the same product because I could import last year's return.  It is unable to open last year's tax return (prepared by last year's H&R Block software) unless you still have last year's version of the software installed. If you don't, H&R Block will charge you to download it again.

The ""interview"" barely helps you fill out your forms. It mostly just asks you the questions on the form, verbatim. If you already know what forms you need to fill out, you might as well do it yourself.

It also has some very aggravating rough edges. For example, during the ""accuracy review"" it identified two informational issues (that by their nature were not correctable - things like ""form xyz doesn't generate in your situation"") and one instance where it said I overrode a value on a form (I didn't).

Problems I had:
 HRB requires the software to be filled-out using a relatively low-grade 1024/768 resolution.  This is a 4/3 aspect ratio.  HRB displays a warning every time the software is opened if it is not 1024/768.

 Had great difficulty filling-out Form 1116
o HRB forces user to fill it out with only modest support.
o HRB does NOT provide for attaching the IRS required calculation statement for Form 1116 line 10s Foreign Tax Credit Carryover.  Neither do they provide any clue or help on how to prepare the required calculation statement.  Because HRB has no provisions to include the required statement for e-filing, I was forced to submit both returns on paper!!  At least they did note that I would have to submit via paper.  Fortunately for me, my 2013 TurboTax software produced a calculation statement that was included with the return and therefore allowed  e-filing of that return.  I was able to use that as a template to prepare one for 2014; but the logic is not that straight-forward.  I prepared the required statement in an Excel spreadsheet which I included instructions how to fill-it out:
 Form 1116 Foreign Tax Carryover, Detailed Computation; 2014 Return.xlsx

 HRB confuses tax-free DIVs and tax-free DIV_INT for addressing the CA tax-free adjustments within the CA state portion of the software.  I had to fudge the HRB input to make things come-out correctly.

 HRB reduced, for some unknown reason, my refund by $6.  They had put that $6 in a field that made no sense at all.  Fortunately I was able to delete it and eliminate the $6 reduction.

 HRB has a strange way of saving PDF copies of the returns, but it does work.  The Fed return and the CA return must be printed separately.

3799,1,H&R Block,47.3333333333333,"04 12, 2015","I'm a TurboTax user who decided to try H&R Block this year due to TurboTax's money grab, and I was actually happy to have a reason to try something different.  And H&R Block did initially appear to be a decent alternative; it wasn't quite as polished as TurboTax, but it worked well enough.  However, I've run into two problems, either of which are bad on their own but which together merit a 1-star review:

1) The program simply cannot complete a return for a self-employed person claiming the ACA premium tax credit.  The program originally reported that this calculation would be added in an update on March 26th, but when that update came out the calculation was NOT included.  Instead, the program now said the following: ""Since you're claiming the ACA premium tax credit and the self-employed health insurance deduction, your return requires additional calculations that aren't part of the program. To file an accurate return, we recommend you complete your return with an H&R Block Tax professional. You must fix this problem before filing.""  And the only two options on that page were to go back, or to look up the location of the nearest H&R Block office!

This is pretty astonishing, and also simply unacceptable for a tax software vendor.  As a result of this problem I was forced to purchase TurboTax to complete the return, and it handled the self-employed deduction and ACA premium tax credit calculations with no problems whatsoever. From what I've read, other tax software handles it as well--it's only H&R Block that can't do it.  For H&R Block to punt on this relatively common tax situation and leave their self-employed customers hanging out to dry (after having led them to wait for weeks in the belief that an update was coming that would fix the problem) is totally unacceptable.

2) On a Mac, the program deletes read-only returns when it tries to save them.  This does not happen on Windows--the program correctly determines it can't write to the file and leaves it alone.  But on the Mac, it reports an error when it tries to write to the return file, but then deletes the return from the disk.  I lost a large amount of work this way, as well as a day's worth of unsuccessfully trying to recover the deleted return from disk.  (For anyone wondering why you'd do this: after I'm done working on a particular return I often make it read-only, so that when I go back to browse it later no changes are saved to the file.  I've been doing this for years with no problems in TurboTax and as I say it also works correctly with H&R Block on Windows--it's just the Mac version of H&R Block that has this bug.  I've re-tested and re-verified this bug and have reported it to H&R Block, so hopefully they'll address it in the future.)

If the only problem were the Mac file deletion bug I might have only dinged the software a few stars.  However, it's totally unacceptable for H&R Block to first tell a group of users that an update will give them the functionality they need (and have every right to expect), and then fail to provide that functionality and instead inform those users that they can't complete their tax return using the software.  Given that that effectively renders the software unusable in this scenario,  don't see an alternative except to give it 1 star.","Can't handle self-employed returns with ACA premium tax credit, and deletes read-only files on Macs"

This year, in part due to Intuit's fiasco with the Deluxe product, I decided to do my taxes with both and compare. I've done my taxes this year with both products, both the downloaded/CD, not online, versions.

Unfortunately, H&R Block loses terribly in the comparison.

First, it refuses to access my Fidelity Investment accounts to automatically download all the tax information. Now this isn't a major issue if you don't have complex investments, but if you do and have to manually enter all the data from the various forms, this alone is enough to make H&RB unacceptable. And note Fidelity is a major financial company, not one H&RB might have added at the last minute or something. And I absolutely confirmed I am entering the correct user name and password (multiple times), that they still work properly on the Fidelity site directly, and so on. It is clearly a failure of the H&RB software, not an issue at Fidelity's nor my end.

Second, H&RB's interview format fails miserably compared to TurboTax's. It does not explain things adequately and is just nowhere near as clear with what it's doing compared to TT.

Third, for some reason (and this bugged me in past years as well when I did my taxes only with H&RB), all windows open very small so have to be enlarged to see much of the information on them. This has occurred with various versions of Windows as well as with OS X Yosemite (iMac).

Fourth, I haven't yet tracked down what it missed in its interview, but it missed a significant amount of money that should appear on my Schedule C.

Fifth, while I couldn't automatically download investment information, it appears that if I could, the process would have been a lot more unwieldy with H&RB than it was with TT. H&RB apparently requires one to download from the financial firms separately for 1099-Divs, 1099-Ints, 1099-Bs, 1099-Rs, etc. It puts the prompts for importing within the interviews of each of those forms' sections, not all together as TT did.

After Intuit's fiasco this year I decided to never use their products again. Their fiasco is still unacceptable, but they have restored the old functionality and are promising next year's Deluxe will be like previous versions of Deluxe. I hope so, for while TT always costs more than H&RB, H&RB has far, far to go to equal TT in ease of use.",Software fails in comparison to TurboTax

Everything started off okay, but when it came time to enter the information that would go onto Schedule D for my dependent child, H&R Block asked for our (the parents) taxable income. Okay, I was used to that, but after I input that info it decided that my child owed 3 times what she earned in federal income taxes!!! At this point, my heart is palpitating and I am frantically trying to find where I went wrong. I entered her info over and over, starting over with a new return, etc., but if I answered the questions correctly, it kept coming up that she owed a heart-stopping amount to the federal government!!! Furthermore, while trying to find what was going on, it kept asking for me to look at a certain form on our (the parents) return that we didn't have. I wasted a lot of time printing IRS instructions and trying to understand what was going on, not to mention the stress it caused me. I finally called TurboTax and asked if I could get that discount they were offering if I bought the Premiere version from them.

After entering NYS tax info, I noticed that the refund amount was low.  That made my Spidey senses tingle.  My husband works in NYC and therefore pays NYS and NYC taxes.  HR Block didn't ask about the NYC taxes and it didn't transfer the NYC tax amount that was entered in the W-2 section of the Federal return.  I figured that I had made a mistake and went through the NY section several times with no luck.  Then I pulled up the NY form and found the NYC tax box and tried to enter the amount manually.  The program wouldn't let me.  After many tries, I decided to contact customer service.
This is what happened...
Rep 1 told me to restart my computer because that would allow the program to ""kick-in"".  I asked her why the software didn't prompt users to do this if ""kicking-in"" on installation was a problem.  She had no answer and I gave in and restarted the computer.  This, of course, disconnected me from Rep 1 who probably told me to restart to be rid of me.  After restart, the issue wasn't solved so I got back into the Customer Service queue.
Rep 2 told me that there is no separate interview for NYC.  She added that this is because NYC was a city and not a state.  I repeat, she said that NYC didn't have an interview on the NYS return because it was a city and not a state.  After doing a facepalm, I explained to her that some cities collect their own taxes.  As such, since NYC (and Yonkers) are part of NYS, there should be an interview for both NYC and Yonkers on the NY software.  She had me pull up the form page and right click on some boxes which took me to other boxes that had nothing to do with our situation.  While she was searching for a way out, I discovered that I could override the blank in the NYC box.  This caused a warning message to appear that said that an override would not allow for efiling.  Additionally, the software did not recognize this override and although the refund on the form changed, the interview screen amount didn't change.  After a lot of failure, I asked for a refund of the state (I had NY free & NJ paid) and she refunded my money.  Amazon was also nice enough to give me a full refund of the software even though I bought it over a month ago.

I do not understand how HR Block missed NYC and Yonkers.  This could affect millions if they don't realize that money they paid to those cities wasn't recorded.  I've used Turbo Tax for years and only decided to switch to HR because of the stunt Turbo Tax pulled this year.  Our state refund was thousands more last year and there were no issues with NYC on Turbo Tax.  How HR Block could gloss over these two cities is mind boggling.  Oh yeah, it's because these are cities and NY is a state.  Buyer beware...You may save a few bucks with this software but you could be out thousands in unclaimed taxes.  You've been warned.

It was able to import data from our TurboTax return from last year, but it was not able to import most of our financial data from investment accounts that (at least last year) TurboTax had no trouble with. The system for valuing donated items seemed easier to use that TT's.  But the real showstopper for me was a missing form. While Block has the form for claiming the tax credit for an electric vehicle, it is missing the form 8911 for the tax credit for an electric vehicle charging station. I would guess that at least 60% of people who buy or lease an electric vehicle are going to install a charging station, so this omission is rather silly. I can fill out the form manually and patch it rather awkwardly into the return, but this means that I cannot e-file with this software this year. I will likely go back to TurboTax next year, and I may have to re-do my taxes in TT this year, just to make sure that things that require continuity (e.g., IRA info) are kept up-to-date properly.

The other problem with the Block software is the difficulty in contacting their support people. This can only be done by phone or via Twitter. I got good responses via Twitter, but there are a lot of things that require more than 128 characters to explain.

I had found Intuit to be a easy product to use and had no problems with it. I read good reviews of the H&R Block product, so I decided to give it a try this year. I found it easy to use, but when the forms were actually filled in from the information I inputted, I knew the federal refund they said we were due was too high. I ran the accuracy review and it said it was accurate. Then I got a late dividend income form I had to put in and no taxes had been taken out of this income. I inputted the information, but it did not change the refund the program said was due. I knew then that something was wrong with the program. When I could not get through on H&R Block's chat line to ask about problems with the program, we called a local H&R Block office and made an appointment for today. We brought the completed tax forms as H&R Block's program had filled them in as well as the forms I had inputted into the program. Sure enough, the program had not filled out the tax forms correct based on the data that I had correctly put in. The head of the office told us they switched from a DOS program to Microsoft this year and that they were finding bugs in the new program, so she was not surprised this had happened. There was no way we could go back and input the corrections the local office had made because I had done it correctly the first time and it was the program that made the mistakes in calculating the forms. As a result, we had to have the local office do our taxes and it cost us $345, almost twice as much as what we had paid a CPA to do our taxes two years ago before I started doing it myself! I was just shocked, assuming that they would be lower than what our CPA would charge. The people were very nice, very efficient, and I have no problem with their work. But I went from doing it myself for $22 to a $345 charge to do it because the program did not work correctly! I am very unhappy about this. The local office told me if I brought in my Amazon receipt they would reimburse me for the cost of the program, and although I appreciate it, I feel like I shouldn't have had to pay to have the local office do it if their program was messed up.

H&R block seemed to fit my needs of a few stock trades, and my other sources of income and deductions.  The product came with a promise of maximum refund and audit support.  I was disappointed.  First, the software does not handle publicly traded limited partnerships (K-1's), instead leaving it to the user to figure out this part of the calculation.  For me the purpose of using software is so I do not have time to research the tax instructions.  So, to me this is a product failure.  Second, if the product promises maximum refund then I guess H&R Block had better hope that I did not make an error.  Hopefully, I filled out my calculations correctly, but if not then I also would be curious as to what their audit support will do.  Unlike Turbo Tax, the import feature from my financial partners was non existent - another waste of my time to have to manually enter this data.

Many Canadians living in the US have to file IRS Form 8891.  Turbo Tax tells you this and includes the form.  Tax Cut makes no mention of it and the form is not even available.  Check the internet for Tax Cut and 8891.  Found similar complains dating from 2009 - 2014.  Another Amazon reviewer wrote that he posted a question about it on the H&R block website in 2010 and it was deleted immediately.

As for technical support, over 30 min on hold to get a rep who claims I need to buy Canadian tax software to get this form and he confirmed it with his manager even after I told them it's included in Turbo Tax's US software because it is an IRS form.  I asked if he'd visit me in prison and bring cookies if I failed to submit the correct forms and he didn't have much of a sense of humor either :)

Update #1

I have been on hold and in the chat queue for 15 minutes after having been quoted a 0 minute wait time. Also after digging into the forms and instructions for the forms there are forms that are not working correctly at all. Had I not reviewed my return and read through form instructions it would have cost me over $1000 in tax credits. The worst part is not even that it messed that up it is that there is no way that I can find to correct it. They do not let you manually update the forms which makes it impossible to fix their mistakes. I am so frustrated with this software that I will be going back to Turbo Tax next year. It also completed my state return incorrectly and screwed up the most basic process of sourcing my income to the correct state. I am worried about even filing with this software as it seems to be a beta product.

Update #2

This product is in no way superior to TT please pay whatever it costs to use TT and have your return completed correctly and pain free. What a joke.

Update #3

I had actually recommended that users try TT but after using both TT and TaxAct I recommend TaxAct. It is much cheaper and in my opion does a better job. It was accurate and pain free filing and an overall great experience. Feel free to ask any questions. Also the error related to the missing deductions was due to the H&R Block software not sourcing spousal income correctly. There are many forms that require married filing jointly returns to source spousal income and with H&R Block they would not separate the income which led to missing credits and deductions. IT happened across 3 separate forms and when I tried to override it state that any override would cause your return to not be efiled which I think is unacceptable.",Easy to use for easy returns but not accurate.

Livid? You get it. And you can bet H&R Block is taking full advantage of TurboTax's misstep. I have to admit the interface here was clean, though not simple, did not ask nearly the same amount of questions to help one through nor worded the complicated stuff in a way to make it palatable If one had tax knowledge or an uncomplicated return, they might like this software. The install, import and transfer was amazingly easy enough. But when I hit a roadblock at the end, there was no way to find where troubleshoot it. You'd think it would return you to the page in question and flag it. The Fed went through, State rejected even though the software found no errors. Where to fix it? Beats me! Obviously it must have been my error, although all info was supposedly ""transferred"" over, but I can't find where to fix the error. I never had any problems filing with TT, but I had some ten years of TT experience. It may be new user hiccups, and I am admittedly not the most patient with this stuff. If TurboTax doesn't get their act together, I will likely use this again, although begrudgingly. Nobody likes doing taxes, software meant to make filing easier should not also make it harder to use nor should they gouge us. BTW, you will find only suspiciously glowing reports on H&R Block's website. Take it with a grain of salt. I cannot say I had the same user experience and seriously doubt they will publish my evaluation. No doubt TT will be reading these reviews as H&RB is. In no way should either rest comfortably.

From there, it went from bad to worse.  I found the program to be extremely non-intuitive and very user unfriendly.  It was very difficult to see where the numbers were coming from (calculations done after I plugged in my numbers); the numbers on the worksheets often had nothing to do with what I had actually entered.  On one worksheet, the software kept inserting my spouse's name in a field designated for my child's name, and it would not let me override and change it.  Also, when attempting to print a worksheet, what was actually printed was not what was on the screen.  When I did my child's taxes and attempted to figure out the ""kiddie tax,"" it was asking me to fill in fields from a prior worksheet that didn't even exist on that worksheet.  So, I called.

The basic look and feel of the software is fine. It leads you through questions as you would hope it would do.

If you have more complicated scenarios, it doesn't work.  They tell you to basically fill out the form!  Isn't that why we use tax software, so we don't have to figure out the intricacies of the tax forms.  I was opening last year's tax program with the competitor and filling out old questionnaires.  Not a good method.
So, I reverted back to the competitor after numerous other customers sent the same message and that company got the message and fixed their pricing.

When I downloaded the program onto my computer it updated the federal return and downloaded my state. A day or two later it updated the state as well. It imported from Turbo Tax without a hitch and imported from some of my financial institutions as well.

My problem is that the calculations were wrong. For my state return, the program failed to add in some of the taxes I paid which made the calculations wrong and I ended up owing over 1K in taxes. I actually went in and looked at the forms to check out what the problem was and discovered this. There was no way to go in and correct this problem manually. I don't even understand why it added in some taxes but not others that should have been there. I even tried going back over the questions again to see if I made an error somewhere. However there was nothing I did incorrectly.

This makes me wonder if some customers of this product failed to get all of the money due to them because if the program calculated a refund for them they didn't (understandably) look to see if there was still something left out which would have increased their refund.

Its a shame about this glitch. I had actually liked the program overall. I found it was fairly easy to navigate. The questions easy enough to understand and the price point very good. But if the program doesnt do the job that it was made for correctly, than its pretty useless.

On a side note, when I went to H&R Blocks website for a solution to my problem I noticed that it said some state returns were not available yet.  (May I point out its already 2/28/2015.

If the expected March 12th update doesn't fix this, I'm asking for a refund (I'll be barely inside the 60-day window), and switching back to TurboTax. By then, Intuit will be offering free in-software upgrades to loyal customers (this has been announced, but I'm not sure it's been implemented yet). It looks like Block missed a golden opportunity here to make major inroads into TurboTax's dominant position in this market.

Update 11-March-2015: The issue with E*TRADE data is fixed, but now there's another problem. Their handling of K-1 forms from publicly traded partnerships is no where near as smooth as TurboTax. You can't import them, so there's a whole bunch of tedious manual entries involved, and God help you if you sold any of these, because the ""Disposition Gain or Loss"" screen assumes that you're some kind of expert that know exactly how everything should be broken down. I shouldn't have to be an expert; that's why I bought the software!",Don't buy this product if you have a K-1!

Waited for 40 minutes and finally got one on my third attempt.  Only for her to tell me that she was software help only (if needed downloading help).  She gave me another 800 number.

The problems:  During preparation, the software told me that I didn't qualify for the tax credit (Obama care) I received in December and so it deducted that amount from my return.  When I printed out the final forms it doesn't say that I owe that back in the repay it area...I don't know if it was deducted or not!

The yes or no boxes were blank because I couldn't find any prompting where it asked me that! The state form for claiming sales tax printed out saying I claimed myself as physically disabled (I'm not) because the software said check the box and gave me the choice of an X or a check mark.  So I used the X.  The form says place an X in the box so that's not clear!!

I filled out the interview portion of both TurboTax Deluxe (upgraded to Premium by Intuit) and H&R Block. The result was different numbers produced by the two tax software. I then needed to trouble-shoot the numerous numbers that were different. Trouble-shooting in TurboTax was easy because most cells have either a magnifying glass to show the source of the number in that cell, or I can right-click and see the source of the number. Unfortunately most of the cells in H&R Block do not have any was of determining the source.

Wow, I couldn't believe that. I called the H&R Block customer service phone number and waited 35 minutes on hold, without knowing how many people were ahead of me. The representative I talked with didn't know how to show the source of numbers in cells, so she requested a supervisor. About ten minutes later the supervisor came onto the phone and told me there isn't any way to determine the specific source of the number. Only the general area of the interview process is sometimes known, but not any specific numbers or cells from other forms.

This leaves me with not being able to determine the reason for the difference in numbers between the two tax software. After using TurboTax for years, and being able to go back to the source, I can't imagine using H&R Block tax software in the future and not being able to question or trouble-shoot the numbers I see. This is a HUGE problem. If a number doesn't look reasonable, I need to be able to determine why the number is the value that is shown, and I can't do that in H&R Block tax software ( a few cells, yes, but not for most cells).

Importing Brokerage accounts:
  TurboTax: Accounts can be de-selected for importing, avoiding duplicating of some spouse accounts.
  H&R Block: Accounts cannot be de-selected for importing.  Some spouse accounts duplicate the tax payer accounts, resulting in some accounts being shown twice.

Schedule A, medical insurance:
  TurboTax: Medicare, Part B, is included automatically
  H&R Block: Medicare, Part B, must be manually added

Schedule A, long term care insurance:
  TurboTax: Part of the interview process, and a separate line in the worksheet.
  H&R Block: No question or line. Must be manually added to the medical insurance.

Schedule A, line 5: local income taxes or sales tax:
  TurboTax: TT automatically selected the higher amount.
  H&R Block: The user needs to check one box, then the other, to determine the higher amount.

I'm getting tired of products that I pay for up front, and which then charge me a fee to use.  If there are costs associated with e-filing (which I imagine are fairly low), then charge it in the price of the software so people can compare apples to apples when pricing software, and stop nickel and diming people to death.

Also, some people may be misled by H&R titling this listing as ""Block Tax Software 14 Deluxe + State"".  This does NOT include a free state e-file.  They simply mean that you can download the tax software for your state.  It will cost you $19.95 to e-file a state return.  If they had any ethics they'd make that clear, but the price for state e-filing isn't specified anywhere in the Amazon listing, and good luck even finding the fine print that makes it clear there's even a fee for your first e-file.

I hardly expect better, though, from an industry that spends millions lobbying to keep tax preparation and e-filing as complicated and difficult as possible to maintain their market.

Among the issues certain input lines on the k-1 screen are not being carried to the proper place on the return.

The HR& site says it can import  TurboTax 2013 returns. It cannot import mine.

I then got in contact with their support person via ""chat"". Took over an hour waiting for my turn.

He said there is a problem with H&R Block importing on XP, and there is no fix.

I asked for procedure to get a refund. He gave it to me. Apparently if you get the software on a CD and it's from Amazon, you can get a refund.

Each time I submitted the next line of the chat, took a long time for a reply. He must have been talking to multiple people at a time. He offered no suggestions or help.  He just sort of just sat there doing as little as possible. He had others to do the same with, I presume.

I asked if it would import my TurboTax if I installed in on another computer with a different operating system. He said probably.

I asked if I tried to install the same CD and license key on a different operating system, it there would be a problem, since it is already installed on my XP machine. He was unsure, but that he had heard it would work. I tried it, and it did install on a Windows 7 machine.

I asked if I could save the return, and copy that file to my XP machine and continue the return on my XP mahcine. He said yes.

So my take is if you need support from H$& block, they are not interested. If there is a problem, they just say yep it's a problem, and offer no suggestions.

You have to know more then them and know the right leading questions.  If you are clever enough, maybe you can find a work around. But they are not going to suggest it. They are on the line with another person(s) talking to them.

So my rating of 1 star still seems appropriate.  They well knew they could not import TurboTax into XP. But their Web site said nothing about that, other than a flat statement it will import it. Then you have to spend over an hour on hold to find they know it's a problem without a solution.  And then you are pretty much on your own and have to use your wits.

I went through all the troubleshooting steps on the HR website, to no avail.

3976,1,H&R Block,47.3333333333333,"12 13, 2014","MY ORIGINAL REVIEW: Received my HRB2014 Deluxe on CD today, after previously giving TurboTax NoLongerDeluxe2014 the benefit of the doubt (despite the horrendous reviews, stupidly) and discovering that the program refused to install after multiple attempts. Sent it back to Amazon in disgust and returned to HRBlock which I had used back in the day when it was called TaxCut.
I was a tad apprehensive, because the reason I initially switched to TT was because TaxCut had become buggy and inaccurate. But hey, redemption is always possible.. yes? This version installed properly, was able to import my last year's TTax return, easy to navigate and user-friendly, IMHO. I appreciated the fact that it only asked me once (early on) whether I would like to upgrade to Premium; once I had clicked ""No Thanks"", the  program did not bother me about it again -- unlike TTax which has a habit of repeatedly asking. As a result, I'm very happy that I ""came back home"" to the H&R Block product.

UPDATED REVIEW as of FEB 5th 2015:

Well, I am peeved beyond belief because guess what? Apparantly the 2014 product gets progressively buggy! I didn't realize this upon receipt in December because the program indicated that the first available update wasn't due until Jan 9th. Okay...no problem. So on Jan 12th I checked for updates and it said a Federal one was available. No state yet, even though I live in NY and they are usually early in releasing. The update APPEARED to install itself... however, the next time I opened the program about a week later, it still indicated ""next update Jan 9th"", that a Federal one was available but no state. So I tried again. It appeared to install but then at the end the download bar rolled itself back. No error message though. Hmmm. (oh, and no State yet)

Over the past 2 weeks I've tried several times to update, and the same thing happens. I just checked some of the one- and two-star reviews and see that other users are having the same problem. Sometimes (after spending hours on hold with non-helpful HRB support) it is resolved by getting a free-download code (I bought mine on CD as I always do) but sometimes now. One user had to turn off his firewall in order to download updates or to e-file!! Sorry but that is NOT gonna happen here. I tried one last time and now the blasted thing stops working even before it gets halfway through trying to (supposedly) update. Of course it's too late for me to return the software to Amazon, because it's past the 30-day window.

At this point I'm totally disgusted (again) with HR BLock and am going to do my taxes this year the oldfashioned way: with a printed-out form, a calculator, and a pen. I normally don't e-file and so that's no big deal. But I am really p.o.'d about having spent 40 bucks for something that I (again) can't trust to do its job correctly. Good thing my taxes aren't too complex anymore.

Guess what I'll be buying next year? TurboTax. I will never again throw any more $ toward an HRB product. Unbelieveable. This should not be rocket science, folks.",Performance goes from Okay to Bad to Worse

3979,1,H&R Block,35.5,"12 18, 2014","I have been a loyal customer of Intuit's TurboTax for over 10 years.  After seeing the negative reviews for TurboTax Basic 2014 stating that schedules and forms needed for self-employed persons and real estate investors are no longer included in that version, I switched to H&R Block's Basic version.  My tax scenario rarely changes from year-to-year, so I don't need to pay extra for the ""advice"" offered in more expensive versions; just need the forms.  Upon installing the HRB software it did import the TurboTax data from 2013.  But when I went to use the forms, they were too small on my screen and therefore illegible.  I have a 5 year old HP desktop PC running Win 7 and a 23"" HP monitor. It was apparent that the window displaying the form could not be re-sized to enlarge the form to make it easy to read.  I tried changing the screen resolution on my monitor and the default text size, but they made minimal difference; the correct resolution with large print option only allowed the form to utilize half the screen width.  This was unacceptable.  Therefore I contacted HRB support and they confirmed that the software lacks the option to enlarge the window for the forms to make them more legible.  I then tried installing the software on my Win XP laptop and had the same results.  So, the software is being returned to HRB for credit and I will bite the bullet and spend the extra $80 for TurboTax.  Bottom line:  If you can't live with an IRS form being only as large as half your screen width, don't buy this software.",Returned For Credit - Forms are Too Small on Screen - Lacks Window Sizing Feature

I recommend that you have two hours to spend with the H&R Block Help Chat folks, so they can tell you which box to check.
The other piece of software is basically a hacky interface to manually enter information into the 1099 form.  You really need to have previous experience manually filing your taxes, in order to understand what and where to enter.  It does not import any of the business data information into your 1040.  Say, for example, that you have spent the past five hours entering 1099-MISC payments into the business software.  Now open the personal software.  Not once does it query the business software.  Not once does it automatically import that data.  Not once does it explain where to input that information.

I thought I'd installed everything, despite the error message I got at the end of the installation.  Thus, when I did my first return, my 1040, everything went smoothly.  I was happier with HRB than I ever was with TT.

But then I tried to do a 1041 for a trust.  It turns out that the ""Premium"" and the ""Business"" are two different programs. I had installed Premium, but the error message was for the Business.  After multiple reinstallation attempts, about 2 hours on hold, and two ""chats"" with HRB, I was told someone will call me back within 48-72 business hours.  I wrote this review, giving HRB 2 stars.  But now, four days later, no one has contacted me from HRB about this issue, so I'm downgrading them to one star. If someone from HRB ever contacts me, I'll edit this review.

More than a week later, I finally got an email from HRB.  They gave me a telephone number to call.  I called, and after 52 minutes on hold, I got to talk with a real person.  After another 20 minutes of futzing around, he says he'll have to do some ""further research"" and get back to me.  I complained at how ridiculous this is.

This week, I finished preparing my individual return and efiled it.  The efiling was rejected.  Only a cryptic reason was provided - they couldn't tell me why, but I should review the forms looking for error messages.  So far as I can tell after looking at all of the forms, there are no error messages.  I don't know why the form was rejected.  It could be an IRS error; it could be HR Block's error.  It would be nice to have some idea of what the problem is, but HR Block doesn't supply it.  Their solution is to print the form and file it by mail.  But if there is a problem, why not identify it and let me correct it now, rather than waiting for some error notice from the IRS?

Original review: I've used the program for several years.  This year's software and customer service have gotten incredibly bad.

As a matter of design, the program offers very little opportunity to review what is going to be e-filed on a business return.

In practice, the software refused to e-file, claiming that I was not authorized to efile and to contact customer service.

I contacted  H&R Block's chat-now customer service, and after waiting about 3 hours on hold to chat with an agent, was advised that the problem was probably that the software was not up to date, despite the fact that I had updated the software this morning, and again during the chat.  It is fairly clear to me that the customer service agent is clueless about the problem, and rather than escalating the problem to the attention of someone who could fix it is primarily interested in blowing me off without solving my problem to clear the queue of backed up complaints.

Mark this as a program which has been seriously downgraded, and those who relied on it in the past and putting themselves at risk by buying it again.","Buggy software, poor customer service."
4035,1,H&R Block,69.99,"01 29, 2015","I've used TurboTax for the last 12+ years for my business (scorp) and personal taxes.  I decided this year, with the debacle that is TurboTax's change in version functionality, that I would give H&R Block software a try.  I saw the reviews that said it would not convert my last year's TurboTax records for the business, and called H&R Block to confirm that.  The customer service person who answered the phone stated it WOULD convert my business return.  I asked if they were sure, since I had seen reviews on Amazon that stated otherwise, so they went and talked to someone else and came back on the line and said no, it would not convert the business return.  Since my asset list isn't too huge, I thought it would be worth giving it a try anyway, so I ordered the product.

Installation required turning off my anti-virus software (not my favorite thing to do, but occasionally needed to install software).  Then, I checked for updates to the software and started my business return.  It asked about company name, address, date the scorp election was requested...all the normal questions you would expect to find.  Then, it asked if my corporation was owned by a trust (among a few other types of entities) and I said ""yes"" since my scorp is 100% owned by a family trust.  Shouldn't be a big deal.  The software then says I need to switch to ""Whole Form"" mode to enter the information about the entity into the Schedule B-1.  There are all of 4 columns on a Schedule B-1, it's not rocket science.  Unfortunately, the software doesn't let you actually ENTER anything into the form.  It just says ""this field can't be modified.""  I tried adding a record, hoping maybe that would get me somewhere, but to no avail.  So, I did live chat to see if they could tell me what was going on, just assuming that I was missing something obvious since I was new to the software.  After specifically telling the person on the line that I was completing a 1120S and it was the Schedule B-1 that was the issue, I waited for about 20 min. for them to try to research the problem.  He came back and asked if the form I was trying to fill out was the 1065.  <sigh>  I said ""No, it's a 1120S.""  At which point he says that the IRS website says the Schedule B-1 is a Form 1065 and I should search for a 1065 on the software.  Now, if you've been around a while (and deal with lots of hedge funds like I do), you happen to know that 1065 is the form for a PARTNERSHIP return, not for a SCorp.  Then he says it's a little confusing because the IRS also things the Schedule K1 is a 1065 form.  <sigh>  They were SCHEDULES to a 1065, but I need those same schedules for a 1120S.  I had to explain the difference, and emphatically state there was no way I could fill out schedules to a 1065 to file with my 1120S.  Then he says maybe the program just got confused and thinks you're a partnership and that's why it won't let you fill out the form.  REALLY???  So his last suggestion was that I should just skip that form for now, and complete the rest of my return, and then when I got to the end and did an accuracy test maybe I wouldn't need the form, or it would give me the option to fill it out then.

At that point, after being on this support ""live chat"" for over an hour, I told the guy that spending the hours to gather information and enter it into their program on the hopes that the program will decide that it wants to work at the end seemed like an exercise in futility.  I think I'm going to have to go back to Turbo Tax, at least for the business taxes.  We'll see if the personal side of the program works any better.

So, unless you want someone to tell you to just complete forms for a totally different type of entity than you actually have, and be incredulous that you don't want to spend the time to fill out the whole return just to figure out if it feels like working or not, I would suggest finding a different software program.

1/30/15 - UPDATE

I decided to give H&R Block's customer support one last try before spending the $100+ on TurboTax for my business.  When I joined the queue at about 6pm last night, I was 69th in line.  About 3 1/2 hours later, I finally got someone.  I had to wait for 3-4 minutes for a response to anything I typed (the guy was obviously working on more than just my on-line chat), but I did get an answer (that was simple like I expected it to be the first time around), and I can fill in data on the form.  The data entry is not intuitive (you need to click a tab at the bottom of the screen to switch from the form view, to an input view, but the tab at the bottom.  The tab at the bottom really just looks like it's a ""this is what kind of page you're on"" rather than a ""click here so I'll do something"" time of tab, so it didn't even occur to me.  The help instructions for filling in forms that came with the software didn't help either, since it just said that forms that are fillable are highlighted blue or yellow, but said nothing about having to find a tab once you have the form up to be able to access the data entry screen.  Simple solution, which the first person should have been able to answer.  I'll keep entering data and see how it goes.  Hopefully I don't need help again, since they're obviously overwhelmed and at least the person I got at 11:45pm when there was no wait had no clue either.  That's not necessarily a good trade off.",Not ready for prime time...at least for businesses

1) Most egregious:  When you call their Help Line, you get a giggly, jive-talkin' teen smacking gun in your ear.  Neither she, nor her Supervisor, could answer a fairly simple question correctly.  I ~know~ the answer I got was wrong, but I still don't know what is right.  As she said, they're only on the phone to help you with the obvious stuff (okay, I said that ) like navigate through the screens (that was her quote).  This means I'll have to file an amended return - and you can bet I'll create it with Turbo Tax, where you can talk to a ~real~ tax advisor if you need one!

1) Also most egregious (tied for first place):  The screens will freeze at odd moments (odd and never convenient).  My gum-smacking 'expert' was well familiar with this bug.  You just go back to the main menu, and try find your way back again to your spot.  <Grrrr>

2) Lack of decent navigation. You have to page through infinite number of screens, because there are no shortcuts in the menu.

3) This software was unable to connect to even *one* of my online investment accounts.  Everything was hand entered, baby.  Cell by cell.

4) A lack of information.  I'm accustomed to Turbo Tax having a hot link so you can get a definition if you need it.  H&R Block expects you to have the lingo down pat.  Keep an extra screen up for Google, and hope you can find a good site.

5) At the end, if you want to save your forms to a PDF, you have to install even more software.  The initial product install was buggy, so I'm truly not looking forward to downloading even more.

For example, I am self-employed and report all my income on 1099 C. I received a 1099 for $3000 from a client. That 1099, after being entered, cannot be seen unless you look at the 1040 form.

There was a button to click that said it would send me to a link giving H&R Block agents in my area - basically, I would have to pay someone to help me, even after having paid for the software.

I reported this as a problem and after 3 weeks they finally got back to me and said that I should just ignore the warning and the fact their product adds the amount over the limit as additional income not reported on a W2.

Contacted H&R Block via Facebook, and was told I probably needed to participate in their 'Best of Both' program. Looked at this, and it appears it is going to cost me at least another $150 to get their 'review' of my healthcare info & resulting tax implications.

4103,1,H&R Block,54.99,"03 28, 2015","I bought this after using TurboTax every year since Windows 3 and the 486 were both new.  Intuit blew it this year by price gouging as seen in the reviews.  So I bought from H&R Block.  Mistake!

1. Import from Fidelity:  The values shown by H&R differ from the paper statement I got from Fidelity on 1099 INT and 1099-DIV.  I went over this with a Fidelity rep and H&&R played games with market discount and premium numbers.  H&R changed the 1099-INT box 10 and box 11 numbers.  The fidelity rep and I could not determine where they got the new number for box 10.  We figured out what field they got their different number for box 11.  We both concluded that H&R got it wrong.

1099-DIV box 11 did not import correctly.  As far as I can tell, H&R tried to break out accounts that household together onto a single 1099 and didn't get it all right.  I fixed it by making the 1099 data in H&R look like the 1099 data Fidelity sent me on paper.

I have a real problem with tax software that reports different values than what will be reported to the IRS.

2. Import from TurboTax.  H&R missed the fact that some of my business deductions under Schedule C in prior years were section 179.  It also missed the fact that I depreciated the entire asset in the year it got put into service.  So it gave me a depreciation for these assets, lowering the tax bill, but not playing by the rules.  So I have to edit every one of those assets and correct them.

3. RITA forms missing.  R.I.T.A. is what many Ohio municipalities use to collect income tax.  TurboTax has had this form for years.  H&R says to go to the Ohio Dept of Taxation website to download the forms you'll need for your return.

4. H&R imported from Turbo Tax, but insists that last year's AGI is zero when e-filing, when it knows better.  Just another error in the tax software that I will never buy again.

So:
I bought H&R because I needed Schedule C support and Intuit charges double for it.
I bought H&R because I need it to import from TurboTax.
I bought H&R because it imports from major institutions like Fidelity.

FAIL.
After I post this I will check to see what H&R's audit support is, because I don't trust the software to get my numbers right.  And then I will explore getting a refund - getting me the lowest taxes by cheating isn't what I had in mind.

H&R: Intuit handed you a once in a lifetime dream by alienating their loyal customer base and you blew it.  I'd rather pay double to Intuit than lose an audit by the IRS because your incorrect software doesn't deliver on its promises.

Additionally, the page breaks are such that lines are cut off. I had to redo my state return using the CA Franchise Tax Board's website because it was such a mess.
2. Navigating around the system is SO MUCH HARDER and lacks all the intuitive structure of Turbo Tax. If you use the ""GO TO"" button you almost always end up at the beginning and have to tab through dozens of pages.
3. For my Federal, it didn't print out all the information on the form even though it is displayed on the screen.
4. It is almost impossible to file for free your Federal return and then just print your state return (no way I was going to give these thieves $19.99 more for a crappy product).

At various places HRB shows a summary of items entered and says to click 'Take me to' to return to any of the topics.  But there are NO 'take me to' links in the state program so navigation is rather quirky.

HR Block is willing to charge you money for state software but then tells you it can't really do Colorado tax credits and you have to do them yourself using the Colorado native forms within HRB.

Like so many reviewers, I've been using TurboTax user for a long, long time -- like, since they started making tax software.  Reading the horrible reviews of their 2014 product, I decided to try H&R Block.  It was cheaper and most people seemed pleased.  Big mistake.

Our federal tax situation is very straightforward: married filing jointly, no dependents, a few 1099DIVs, a 1099R, a couple of W2s.  WIth H&R Block, that all went smoothly.
Then it came to downloading 1099s.  Couldn't do it, despite the program assuring me that it was in communication with the Big Investment Companies.  So, manual entry of interest income, etc was necessary.  Wasn't pleased, but regarded that as only a minor inconvenience.

The nuclear monkey wrench was thrown into the works when it came time to calculate Foreign Earned Income.  H&R Block just acted as if it never existed, despite several attempts to use their 'interview' process.  I had to finally open a 2555 EZ (note the EZ part....) and do the damned thing myself!
To add insult to injury, while H&R BLock decided to accept the 2555EZ, it wouldn't recognize the Foreign Earned Income when considering our Roth IRA contributions.  The damned thing INSISTED that we'd over contributed (we haven't; I know).

Despite trudging to the finish line using H&R Block, I have no faith that my tax return is correct.  So it looks like I'm out the twelve bucks I paid for the download via Amazon because as soon as I finish this review, I'll be forking over the additional $30 and buying the Turbo Tax Delux download.
Using Turbo Tax, we've been reporting Foreign Earned Income since 2007 without a hitch (or an audit).  Not happy that Intuit is gouging us and producing a product that's not as good as in years past, but, according to what I'm reading, it's still the superior program when it's necessary to report unusual tax situations.

4202,1,H&R Block,27.9333333333333,"03 31, 2015","Well, We've used HR Block for probably 20 years and it's worked fine every year.  This year I got to the end of preparing my return and got this notice:  ""Since you're claiming the self-employed health insurance deduction and have marketplace health insurance, your return requires additional calculations that aren't part of our program.  To file an accurate return, we recommend you complete your return with an H&R Block tax professional.  You must fix this problem before filing.""

My first thought was why I wasn't warned about this perhaps a month ago when I entered this data (it actually walked me through the questions regarding self employment and health insurance and those sections have the green checks on them)?  I was waiting until now to file because I was waiting for some late arriving investment forms to complete.  This brick of a statement sets me back to starting over with another program.

A quick web search of this error text turns up a blog that points out this same problem that others are having with HR Block.  It says Turbotax and TaxAct seem to handle this properly.  Very disappointed with HR Block.  Wasted my money and time on it.  Just purchased Turbo Tax.

4203,1,H&R Block,27.9333333333333,"03 30, 2015","Horrible program! I could not access the software as I was asked for my ""activation code"" and the only thing I had was an Amazon email that had contained in it a ""product"" ID. Clarification of this took waiting for 1/2 hour online with HR Block before I even got a response. (The telephone contact was automated.) I actually ended up calling Amazon while I waited for an HR Block online agent and a real human clarified the issue and later emailed me that she had sent an internal memo to note the confusing terminology. This occurred almost simultaneously as the HR Block agent came on line. He was unaware of how one is given an activation code if purchased through Amazon as a download, and gave me another generic code.

I then started my return, which having used Turbotax for years, I found the software very user unfriendly, with little explanation to what I was doing or any instructions to clarify entries on itemized deductions. I then noted that my itemized deductions were not being tabulated at all, in particular, over $8000 in medical bills, something I had never had and therefore had no experience with. When completed, I was told by the software that my itemized deductions were less than the standard deductions ($5K) which seemed impossible. This involved another minimum 1/2 wait for online support. Once I got someone, he was unable to help me after over another 1/2 hour of my time. He sent me to the forms section and ultimately a worksheet, which was grayed out and empty (#29). He asked me to calculate my return by hand and fill it out! I asked if the IRS laws are possibly that the medical expenses are only a percentage to be deducted or is it the full amount if it is at least 10% of one's AGI as I understood it, and he said it was the full 10%. If this online support is simply technical, or if he didn't know the answer, he should have stated that rather than give me misinformation. (Later I simply Googled it and discovered after one minutes time, you can only deduct amounts OVER 10% of AGI.)

I suspected he was wrong and I had lost trust in the software and his answers; we ended the call asking for refund instructions. I was concerned also that my information was stored with HR Block, when, in fact, I was not going to use them to file. I asked how it could be deleted. He stated, ""It was only on my computer,"" which I doubt is correct. When I asked if I could be emailed a copy of the session, he said, no, but I could copy it, which ultimately I could not do as the software apparently wouldnt allow it, so I wrote the refund information by hand (which was going to take 4-6 weeks). I noted after I closed the session, one can print a copy of the session, which he did not know either.

Once I found the medical deduction information MYSELF online at IRS.GOV, and after 4 long hours mainly of waiting for their customer support, out of sheer disgust I did finally use the program to file, but I have no confidence it is correct. I realize their guarantee states they will refund you the amount for another program cost if they give a higher refund, but who is really going to incur the cost and time to do that, which they are banking on!  Despite the many good reviews I found online, I do not concur! I will never use the program again and will rate it as such on every site I can find.",Horrible Program!

But needless to say after 15+ years with Turbo Tax, I bought H&R Block for this years taxes.  The program is not bad.  It is a little different than Turbo Tax and not quite as user friendly but still good.  I was pleased until I got to the state taxes.

Now I will openly admit that I did not realize that the version I bought was the Federal tax only edition.  But I have two major complaints with this.  First, it is not clearly marked.  In the title it should say FEDERAL ONLY!  It is only after comparing the two that it even occurred to me that there were two different versions, one with state included and one without. Second, the price to add the state tax is an additional $36.95!  Are you kidding me!!  I understand that I made a mistake but the price difference is ridiculous!  It is $29 for the combined state and fed H&R Block.  I paid $21 for the federal only version and now to get the state I have to pay an additional $37 through their web site!  That doesn't even make sense.  I can save $8 just by buying the combined version, but then of course I have to start all over again with inputting all our information.  So they are hoping I'll cave and give them even more money!  In my opinion this is just as bad as Turbo Tax!

4256,1,H&R Block,34.6,"03 15, 2015","After reading bad reviews of TurboTax price gouging, I decided to try H&R Block.  I downloaded to my Mac, installed it and imported our TT 2013 return all relatively quickly and easily.  Halfway through the income section I realized my husband was listed as primary even though on the 2013 return, I'm primary (I'm still not sure how this happened).  Feeling annoyed but thinking it wouldn't matter, I went on.  In the next section I discovered that our other imported information was now wrong.  My previous 1099 entries were listed in his name and vice-versa so I wouldn't be able to simply change the amounts to reflect 2014.  I deleted the 1099int entries and typed in new entries.  However the 1099div and 1099B entries were longer and more complex so I decided to download them from the broker site.  Using the H&R download tool in the form, I connected to my broker and got the information.  The software showed me a pop-up box with correct entries and a ""import"" button.  I clicked the button and the software crashed.

Feeling frustrated by now, I re-started the software.  Stepping through the form going back to the div section I found that the 1099int entries were now duplicated!  Thinking I would come back and delete the duplicates, I kept going to the div and found the imported information but somehow my div information was entered under my husband's name.  It may not matter to IRS under whose name dividends and sales are listed as long as taxes are paid but it matters to me.

By this time feeling pretty angry I decided what I should have done is reverse our names in the Personal Information section.  I back-tracked there and since I had not manually entered our info, I couldn't quite figure out how to change our names.  Searching Help for ""name change"" ""personal information"" and similar options got me no help.  By this time, I've been working over 3 hrs on a Saturday morning.  I called H&R Support and after 20 minute waiting, I decided to simply start over from scratch.  While still waiting for Support to answer, I manually entered our Personal Information and got all the way back to the 1099div and 1099B section.  I clicked on the link to log back into my broker site and the software crashed!  I hadn't been saving my entries so when I re-opened it I was back at the Income section.  Lesson learned, I re-re-entered info and got back to 1099div and 1099B and it crashed again.  At that point I've been on hold over an hour and finally get Customer Support but by now I've forgotten why I called.  I asked why is the software crashing and lady says she doesn't know and I have to call their ""Technical Support"" line.  Neither my request for help, sympathy for my troubles, my cold sarcasm about ""Customer Support"", nor flat out hostility got me anything except TechSupport's phone number. Almost six hours of my Saturday gone.

Several days later I called and eventually get through to Technical Support after only 22 minutes.  Asking why does the software crash when I try to log into my broker's website, the man tells me that there must be something wrong with the broker's website, maybe it has a virus or has been hacked!??!  In a kind of shock, I blurted out that I couldn't believe he would say something so silly and much less believe that it could be True.  I pointed out that I was logged into my brokers website already on Safari with no problems and that the download had worked one time.  Regardless, this got me no help.  After that the man would only say that I would have to call my broker to ask why does their download information make my H&R software crash.

The next Saturday I did actually call my broker's tech support line and asked if there was anything about the download information that could cause my H&R software to crash.  I was gently laughed at and told this is not likely.  The Tech transferred me to my broker's tax assistance line.  After about 3 minutes a tax adviser listened to my long story and immediately focused on my real problem which was about entering the 1099div and 1099B entries.  It took us about 30 minutes to enter both my husband's and my information and the only reason it took that long is because the tax adviser didn't recognize some of the fields and names I was reading off to her.

-they had a bug in the software that would not allow anyone with an SSN starting with the number 9 to e-file.  This may not impact you, but it shows the level quality that goes into the software
-technical support is possible once you find the number and get past a horrible automated personality that tries everything possible to keep you from getting to a human operator

Compared to TurboTax, HRB was difficult to navigate.  It was very difficult to drill down to real forms to verify entries or to adjust values.  The deluxe version did a very poor job of providing access to schedule C entries.  When you were able to get to the correct forms for schedule C, the program literally fought your attempts to plug in real and legal entries.  When you were able to finally make entries via a rather convoluted path through many worksheets, the validation routine declared the entries as errors and would not permit e-filing to proceed.  The only way to get past his roadblock was to delete all of the schedule C forms and entries and start over using a different path.  After lengthy trial and error efforts a successful validation was achieved.  Ridiculous!

After getting a valid Federal return according to the program, I moved on to my state return.  No new data was required or should have been required.  The state validation passed on the first attempt.  Everything was finally good, right?  No, not at all.  Today I received notice from my state that I under reported some income -- income that was actually on the state return but HRB erroneously did not include in the correct line.  Since I had a refund coming from the state that was large enough to cover the increased taxes, the state just reduced the refund and sent me a letter.  I hope that this is all I hear from my state.  Maybe my state has seen a pattern of errors from HRB processed returns.  That would be good for me.

Next year I will be going back to TurboTax.  I'll pay the extra dollars for the TurboTax version knowing that my experience will be less frustrating and less risky.",Never again!

They don't help you find it.  You have to search your hard drive and find the file for them. They don't even tell you what the extension is for the file you're looking for.  Other annoyances are that the ""Next"" button always seems to be in a different place.  You can't just keep clicking.  You have to stop each time and move the cursor to where the ""Next"" button is on that page.  Also, you have to use the exact format they want.  They're unable to figure out that 6-31-2014 is 06/31/2014.  Instead of simply converting the entry to the format they want, you get an error message and have to re-enter the date for them.  Also, you have to go through the questionnaire to find the exact location where the data came from and change it there.  No overrides allowed!",State program is worthless

We have used TaxCut for the last 4-5 years and had reasonably good experience; but the 2014 software has been a disaster for us. There is always some question of whether the 'above the line' guided questions are intuitive and helpful for the forms, but the gap is a little larger this year, and we needed to go into the whole form in roughly 10 places, when this has been rare in the past. More notably, the software takes a dictatorial stance on what it believes is the correct answer on a form. In one instance, it incorrectly filled in the name and SSID for stock sales, and refused to allow change, EVEN THOUGH these stock sales were manually entered rather than imported - when I tried to correct the relevant party from my spouse to myself, I eventually found a way to override and enter my on name and SSID, but when I went to file, the software would not allow us to electronically file, due explicitly to this change. Obviously I cant file with this error and the online chat help that the program refers to is not evident when I followed the link, so I started over.

The questions are sometimes phrased poorly, the default is often questionable and additional information is not as readily available in Turbo Tax.  As a result my taxes were off by a significant amount and it took my quite some time to track down.  The software also calculated my healthcare credit incorrectly, something that I almost missed.  This was a blatant error by the software in how they processed the information provided and it forced me to complete the form by hand!  Something I have NEVER had to do with TTax.

I verified that it could handle my complex tax return and that it supported Schedule K-1. However, my experience with the software was horrible.

It struggled with charitable deductions. The software was complaining about an issue with a donation, but I couldn't tell what the issue was. Their help links are useless and devoid of meaningful information. Some questions in the software are straight from the IRS forms (which begs the question of why would I use software that doesn't help or guide me with these forms).

The biggest issue that I ran into is when I tried to enter in my Schedule K-1. The software couldn't guide me through this process. It couldn't handle DPAD deductions or research credits. It also was missing deductions from my state tax return. I was fighting the software instead of the software helping me.

And when it came time to file, we found out that with state and federal e-filing, it would have cost $110, while Turbo Tax would have cost $60. Plus tax in both cases. H&R imported our 2013 Turbo Tax 1040 just fine. And since we didn't have to pay up front (I think that's True in both cases), when we discovered we'd have to pay $50 extra to use H&R Block, we canceled the filing, downloaded Turbo Tax Deluxe 2014 and used that.

Funny thing is, when Turbo Tax went through its features & pricing gyrations, all H&R Block needed to do was match them when their price came back down. They didn't, and so missed a great opportunity to pick up new customers like us.

So--the one star isn't about the software, it's about the fact that for those who itemize deductions it costs $50 more for no added benefit.

These are my complaints about HRBlock tax software.
1. I file multiple state returns. HRBlock tax software doesn't communicate between the states information. When you change info in one state which affects the other state, you have manually account for it. TurboTax is robust enough to adjust the inputs as necessary.
2. I called customer service and got a machine which couldn't understand what I was asking for and hung up on me twice.
3. A couple of the questions it asked in the interview were phrased in ambiguously. TT was very clear about what it was asking.
4. Technical support takes an incredibly long time to get to. And when you do, the nice people trying to help you don't seem to know much. I had to explain my questions 3 different ways before they understood what I was asking for.
5. Clunky appearance and atrocious (I cannot stress this point enough) navigation functions. The controls for navigation in this software are so bad it merits saying it again. It has a clunky appearance and has atrocious navigation functions. I feel like I'm using software from 1998. For example, why does the back button take me all the way back to the start of the section? What if I just want to go back to the last page I was on? How do I get there? I click back and it takes me back to the start of the section. Then I have click Next about a dozen times before I get to the page I wanted to see. I hate this garbage.

It transferred last years information from Turbo Tax without a hitch. I followed the instructions carefully and at the end of the program it informed me that I owed more than $3,000 in federal taxes. This was strange because we had never owed federal taxes before and to me $3,000 is a decent sum of money.

I have gone back to another product, which has the forms I need within the software.  I have been trying to get my money-back through HR Block's Money-Back Guarantee for over a month.  I followed the instructions on their website, and I wrote a letter to request a refund for the product and enclosed a copy of my Amazon.com purchase invoice, indicating in the letter that the invoice was enclosed.  I called in a month later to check on the progress.  After being on hold for 30 minutes they transferred me to another department where I was put on hold for another 30 minutes.  When I finally spoke to someone, they indicated they were still waiting for me to send in a copy of the Amazon.com purchase invoice!  I am a business professional and know how to write a business letter, and I am meticulous in how I provide all necessary documentation.  After much discussion about how this seemed like fraud to me because they claimed there was no Amazon.com purchase invoice enclosed, I asked for a supervisor and explained to him, Tony, what was happening.  I asked if there was any way I could email another copy of the invoice to him so that he could handle my problem, but he said they could not receive emails from customers at his level.  He gave me a case number, RES-35443017, and promised someone would call me within a few days to address my problem, and possibly that person could accept an email.  A week later, after not hearing back from them, I called again, and once again I was on hold for at least 30 minutes before being transferred around.  After speaking with Teresa for 15 minutes, who said she could only take notes and not do anything more for me, I asked to speak to her supervisor, Jessica.  Once I explained the problem (yet again) to Jessica, she informed me that she would have to transfer me to another department because this department was for online filing only.  I was shocked because that was not what I had requested in the menu system or their automated ""help"" system.  I asked Jessica why I just spent 15 minutes talking with Teresa, and she guessed it was because Teresa did not fully understand the product I had, despite the fact that I had explained this to Teresa, and Teresa indicated that she had my records from my previous phone call, based on the case number that I gave her.

Like many people I was upset about the changes to the Turbo Tax software but I had already purchased it, then I found out that H&R Block was offering a free download of their sofware to Turbo Tax customers, so I wrote to them and sure enough they gave me a free download, figured I'd give it a shot.  I completed my taxes in H&R Block and found that the software was clunky and was not user friendly, the questions were asked in a confusing manner that on multiple occasions left me less than confident of the answers.  At this point I should clarify that I have often filled out my taxes long form by hand, majored in finance in college, and actually used to volunteer to do taxes for low income people...so I can say with confidence I generally know what I'm doing with taxes, and to be left dumbfounded on so many of these questions seemed odd to me.

So I wrapped up my taxes but I just couldn't shake the feeling that my form wasn't accurate.  After thinking it over I decided to bite the bullet and open up TurboTax rather than returning it.  The interview process was easy to use as I've come to expect over the years.  Also, for some reason, TurboTax ended up getting me a couple hundred dollars more for my return, which I don't really understand since its all pretty simple math, so I went to the forms and it turns out TurboTax had asked about a few more deductions like car registration fees which H&R Block didn't ask about.

What a mistake!  I have spent countless hours dealing with program errors and the product's cumbersome navigation.  Next year I will  reluctantly fork out the additional money and go back to TurboTax.  Granted, my tax situation was a bit complicated as I was a part-year resident in two states, but here is a summary of my experience:

THE GOOD

- It easily imported my TurboTax files and brokerage data.
- The customer support phone reps were nice (but totally ineffective!).

THE BAD (and THE UGLY)

- Erroneous calculations!

ESPP and NQSO sales can be complicated, and if done incorrectly, you can be double-taxed on amounts already included in your W2 by your employer.  Even though I indicated I had these exercises and sales in H&R, it let me proceed without checking the cost basis, etc.  No question, no nothing.  Even trying to dig further into the functionality, I felt I couldn't trust the software to handle the issue, as it still wasn't asking for all the details to re-calculate the cost basis like it should, so I will not be double-taxed. H&R decided I owed the IRS $8000, even after its validations and checks.  I decided to eat the cost of the H&R purchase and bought TurboTax.  TurboTax guides you through the nuances, so you get maximum refund.  Instead of owing $8000, I got a refund of $1000, which is similar to prior years' returns with these transactions, too.

Probably, H&R has the correct functionality, but it did not guide me or catch the double-count, like TurboTax.  For fairly complicated transactions, I need the guidance.  H&R did the audit check and decided its return was correct, even though I had indicated I had ESPP and NQSO transactions.  I rely on my tax software to know more about the tax considerations than I do, and catch them before I do something very stupid.  TurboTax did... H&R didn't.  It only cost me $30 to find out the difference between the two, but it saved me from a $8000 H&R error.",Not at all helpful for ESPP and NQSO transactions.  Turbo Tax catches the double-tax issue.

This software does not include many important IRS forms. Specifically, for me, I want to file separate but married and indeed, it allowed me to do so with no problems nor warnings. But I know that I also need to file form 8958 since I live in a community property state. Had I filed with this software, I'd have been audited by the IRS and fined a mighty amount. They also charge penalties and interest. California can even be harsher by charging you penalties and interest on your entire tax obligation, not just the shortage. I tried for 5 hours today to get an answer to this issue but they kept passing me back and forth between their ""tax experts"" and their ""software experts."" Neither group seems adequately trained to answer any questions without looking them up in their nifty customer support database which has no answer to form 8958.

4527,1,H&R Block,27.9333333333333,"02 22, 2015","Mar. 1 Update:  After writing the review last week, I remained on hold for chat for a total of one hour and 45 minutes.  At that point, I had to run to the restroom.  By the time I got back, someone had come on the chat line, and when I didn't respond immediately, ended the chat.

Still the same issue this morning.  Right now, I am waiting for online chat AND on hold for a phone assistance.  It has ONLY been 10 minutes so far, so I anticipate I will have quite a long wait ahead of me.  In the meantime, I am trying to get the system to allow me to manually enter the values.  (I figure I can look up the values online while I am waiting).  It turns out I need to identify when I BOUGHT the item originally to be able to do that.  I wish at this point that I could give this item 0 stars.  I have never been as disgusted with ANY software as I am with this right now.

I may end up changing this review if I am ultimately able to get through the program, but right now, I am completely disgusted with this program.  I am relatively experienced at preparing taxes (used to do it professionally 'back in the day').  Previous to this year, I have used Turbo Tax annually for a LOT of years, but due to the extremely negative reviews on Turbo Tax this year, along with the high cost of the product, I opted to try H&R Block this year.

So... I have gotten most of the way through my tax return, and pretty much ONLY need to item my deductions for the non-cash deductions I had for 2014.  This is material, since my husband and I had quite a significant number of donated items this year, including tools, sporting goods, clothing, etc.  Using Turbo Tax in prior years, it has been a simple matter of going to the appropriate category, selecting the item, and then choosing whether to use the high, medium, or low value of this item.  I expected something similar with H&R Block's DeductionPro.

Unfortunately, when I got to that section last week, a window opened up to load the values, and it stayed there and HUNG.  I tried updating the software, closing the program, and rebooting.  Nothing worked.  I'm back at it again; same results today (I also reset my modem, updated the software again, and waited ALL week long in the hope that this was just a LOT of data.)

After all of the previous steps, and waiting an hour plus, I decided to use H&R Block's on-line chat.  I waited over 45 minutes the first time and then had to go do something.  This time, I've been waiting for over an hour with ZERO response.  The only option I have been able to find so far is to manually look up values online elsewhere and then manually enter them into the program.  Quite frankly, this functionality is the MAIN reason I purchase tax preparation software, other than the ability to file electronically.  If I end up having to do this myself, I will be demanding a refund due to non-functionality of the program.

The other parts of this program seem to be fine, but that's immaterial if it won't do EVERYTHING that is needed for a tax return with itemized deductions.  I am completely disgusted with the product and the company's support at this point.","DeductionPro non-functional, on-line support ridiculously slow"

I switched to H&R Block after years of being a TurboTax user, after all of the recent backlash over the price increase.  The $29.99 price tag seemed like a bargain, until I purchased the second state for a whopping $39.99.  Still, I thought I was coming out ahead since TurboTax also charges extra for the second state (though I think only $29.99).  But here's the kicker - H&R Block won't e-file the second state return!  It only allowed me to e-file my Federal return and my NJ return.  For my NY return, it wanted me to print and file by mail - which, on it's own printed form says I cannot do because NY won't accept by mail, returns that were prepared using a tax preparation software.

Still, now I'm left with buying TurboTax just to file my NY return - and I'll probably have to purchase a second state also because the NY return requires information from my NJ return.

4566,1,H&R Block,27.9333333333333,"02 14, 2015","Last  year I used Turbotax to complete my federal and state refunds without a problem.  This year, I decided to use HR Block's tax software because it was priced more competitively.  I was very disappointed with the product.

The software had difficulty installing from the disc it was shipped on.  It would consistently freeze and give me errors when installing.  I was only able to successfully install it by copying all of the files from the disc onto the computer.

Once I had the software installed, I found it relatively easy to use.  The software asked basically the same questions as Turbotax, and was straightforward for someone like me who had a very good idea going in exactly what their taxes should look like.  I had all of the information entered within an hour of starting my return.

I was ready to efile my federal and state returns, when the software claims it was running a final accuracy check (it had already run a similar check for both the federal and state forms individually).  The software returned an error in the healthcare coverage/subsidy forms and directed me to the appropriate place to address it.  I had entered all of the information correctly, but the software was poorly written and was not able to use that information to correctly fill in the official IRS form.  The software left an important box blank on the official IRS form even though I had entered that information into the software earlier.  The software would not allow me to correct the form.

I attempted to use their online chat support to address the cause of this problem.  This process was a nightmare.  I waited for over an hour to chat with an agent.  The agent was thoroughly unhelpful.  Their entire online support process consisted of telling me over and over again that I should go back and check that I entered my information properly.  Several of the questions and responses by the support agent demonstrated that they had no working knowledge of the software.  After an hour of this unhelpful dialogue, they told me that this was a known issue and there was an update that would be out within the next week.  There was nothing they could do to help me.  This was a frustrating experience and delayed filing my return and getting my refund.  I asked for HR Block to address their deficiency by waiving the state efile fee since their software was the cause of the problem.  The agent ignored my question multiple times.

I know I will be returning to Turbotax next year, I recommend you all skip the headache I went through with HR Block this year.

Update: While my Federal return was quickly approved and my refund paid, my Virginia state taxes have been held up.  I have no way of knowing for sure but I suspect the software somehow messed up a form that got me flagged for an audit.  I'd give this product negative stars if I could","Disappointing product, be ready for a long wait and unhelpful support if you have any problems"

At the time there were lots of positive reviews by former TurboTax owners.  Now I wish I had just shelled out the extra cash to get TurboTax.

Major complaint:  I lived in two states last year and I wanted to e-file for both states (I've done this multiple times in TurboTax with no problem).  H&R Block allowed me to pay for an extra state version which I did.  However, when I went to file, H&R Block would only allow me to e-file ONE state.  What's the point of buying the extra software if I have to mail it in?  For me this is a deal breaker, I won't purchase H&R Block software again.

Other complaints:  Lots of bugs.  They have attempted to put in a feature to review all the inputs (which would be nice if it worked), but it appeared to just pop up random forms with highlighted areas.

They treat their customers like they have a monopoly and they can treat us however they want and we have to come back to them, no customer loyalty appreciation or even respect. So I really wanted this software to be usable, and it seemed to start out OK. It transferred last years info from TT and seemed alot like TT, but every time I started it up it told me I was due a update, no surprise, and it would mention a forms update due out Jan 9 and each update seemed to be estimated to take the same amount of time. I would agree to the update and I would go through the update wizard screens and it would appear to be updating, then I would add whatever W-2 or 1098 etc. that had come in the mail, save and close it until next time. Last Saturday I sat down to do a quick 1040EZ for a friend,  you get 5 fed files with the program, and when I got to the final checks it told me I couldn't file because I didn't have a forms update that was due Jan 9. So I updated multiple times and it kept saying the same thing. After going through all the online trouble shooting I called customer service and the lady walked me through a few more things with no success. She told me she would elevate the problem, gave me a problem ref. ID and said someone would be in touch within 24 hours, that was Saturday, it is now Tuesday evening and still nothing. I checked some of the other reviews and several others have had the same problem. The program won't update and allow you to finish.

Update: Dropped it from a 2 star to a one. It's now Wednesday so I called and spent another 30 min waiting for a customer serv. rep. They informed me that the last rep hadn't escalated my problem after all, they had closed it. This time a ""supervisor"" said they would escalate it, and gave me a new res #. I asked if they had a current version that didn't require an update and was told that year after year they sell the same basic program and you have to update it after you get it. There is no updated version available, only the base program that requires an update to work. They are aware of the update problem and hopefully their tech support has found a fix. Right. The good news is that I found out from the web site that they have a 100% satisfaction guarantee so maybe I can get my money back.
UPDATE 2: Waited until Saturday, one week after the original go around with customer support. Still nothing from tech support, waited forever (30 or so minutes) for a human and told my story again. The ""supervisor"" apparently didn't open a new problem screen so the new RES # was just to shut me up. Reminded them of the ""100% satisfaction guarantee"" so they said I would get the money returned to my card. We'll see if that happens. The next day Tech support called, 7 days after the ""24 hour"" response time, saying they were way behind. Duh, then the customer service people shouldn't be saying 24 hr. call back. It seems there is a updated version available but I told them I had already been granted a refund so no thanks. This was HRB's chance to get a chunk of TT's customers but I guess the product wasn't up to it. Too bad. Don't know if I'll try it again in the future. Depends on if TT pisses me off again.

I finally contacted HRB and spent an hour and half on hold, and then another half hour trying to resolve the issue, which still did not work.  In fact, I had already attempted all of the suggestions made by their tech support before I ever contacted them.

I'm not sure what they've done to their formerly stellar software, but they've lost this user because of the changes they've made.  I won't use TurboTax either.  Going to try TaxAct purchased directly through their website.  If all else fails, I'm going back to filing on paper.  This is ridiculous.  :o(","Long time HRB user, but no more!"

The H&R Block software calculated my return at $2300, but when I hit send to e-file, the total went to $0 and the saved form shows $0 refund. After an hour of waiting on the phone, giving up, and waiting several more hours on the chat line (You are 43 in line, a representative will be with you right away), customer service, if that is indeed what we can all agree to pretend to call it, told me that the problem was mine to work out with the IRS. Thanks H&R Block!

I requested a supervisor and she thought I was complaining about not getting a refund. But $0 is a rare refund. The IRS knows that even a small refund perpetuates the game. My refund was $650 before I started to add credits and deductions. So, the lack of understanding, for whatever reason, made things worse, if the word worse even applies.

The maximum refund guarantee, by the way, is a scam. It is not the difference between returns, but, perhaps, a refund on the product after you jump through their hoops. That, of course, means you must  re-do your taxes with a different product(after buying it) or in person (and pay them), because you need documentation. In my case, I have to re-do my taxes anyway, so I will seek the product refund. I'll let you know how that works out.

Update: A similar review of mine on this subject has been ""moderated"" twice from the H&R site. Perhaps they should move a moderator or two to the customer service center instead of defending a flawed product with censorship. Just sayin'

Update: I have the entire transcript from the chat session and will post it someday soon, but I have wasted enough time on this for one weekend. I need to do my taxes, AGAIN.

There is very little hand-holding and it is difficult to understand where you are supposed to start. H&R Block is designed for people who understand tax forms but want to use software to file. Where TurboTax walks through possible forms by asking layperson's questions, TurboTax presents a checklist of forms and asks you to pick what you need.

The H&R Block windows look dated and unfriendly. Important links to information are simple hyperlinks instead of large buttons like TurboTax. Windows are crowded with too much information making navigation difficult. Overall the design looks like a program made for Windows 98 instead of the slick windows in TurboTax.

The help in TurboTax is much friendlier. TurboTax offers simple easy to understand help in the question windows, where H&R Block offers voluminous help in popup windows and appears to be tailored for people who already understand taxes. It is rarely useful.

All that said I do know taxes and could figure out what I needed to do. But then H&R Block wouldn't let me file. After purchasing the software it told me I couldn't file my federal return because the IRS forms were not available for another week. I went to the IRS website and downloaded those forms. After H&R Block got the federal forms a week later, it told me I couldn't file my state return for another week because the state forms weren't available. Again I went to my state's tax website and downloaded the forms H&R Block didn't have.

I agree TurboTax is flawed and this year's version has even more limitations. I didn't buy TurboTax this year but for the past 3 years it was very easy to use and let me file my taxes, something I can't do yet with H&R Block.","TurboTax is flawed, but H&R Block is a worse alternative"

(kept saying my dependent would not qualify but did not say why or how to fix it). I have worked as a software engineer so I'm computer savvy enough to use a simple tax software package. After an hour of messing with it and errors would not clear, I used TurboTax's free filing site and 15 minutes later my taxes were done. I compared the result with H&R and there was over a $600 difference. So obviously I went with TurboTax. I contacted H&R's customer service and they want me to physically mail them the receipt and wait weeks for a refund (if they ever actually do refund).
Pros: - Price is not ridiculously high
  - Software gives you information on thresholds to qualify for credits and deductions
  - Nice logo
Cons: - Software interface is a few generations behind (not as good user experience)
  - Errors are not clearly defined and handled poorly
  - Errors are difficult to resolve and software will either not let you continue or error results can make a huge difference on your return
  - More time consuming and clunky than other software
  - Unsure if they will actually refund money if dissatisfied.

I've also had the application crash several times. First, it crashed whenever I tried to import data from Charles Schwab. Fortunately, an update fixed that bug. However, installing the update proved to be difficult because the updater locked up. Required a restart of my computer to get it to work properly.

Then, importing data from Fidelity failed because the password field does not allow enough characters for the length of password at the Fidelity site. I clicked on the link inside the H&R Block Tax Software to go to the customer support page for the Fidelity and it leads to a missing page.

If you're not paying AMT then carry on. But for those of us who do, when you pay AMT you're not getting credit for some of you deductions. And then if you get a state tax refund, it may or may not be taxable. the only way to do this is to reconfigure your taxes, and then fill out a worksheet that only turbotax seems to have access to. Turbo tax walks you through this process. HR block literally says ""figure it out yourself and then get back to us"". The problem is I can't even find the necessary forms on the IRS website. Apparently you have to do some trial and error to find out how much of that refund is taxable and not- you have to figure out how much of a refund would not have changed your taxes. At that point I quit HR block and went and downloaded turbo tax, since they do this for you. Close but no cigar.",Don't use if you paid AMT in 2013

But since I had already submitted my return that was rejected due to a bug in the H&R Block software, I had to pay $20 to do it!  So I bought this horrible software to snub Turbotax and it turns out to have cost me more than expected, hours and hours of extra time and frustration due to a buggy program with an awful interface and useless customer support.  DO NOT EVER BUY H&R BLOCK SOFTWARE.  Period.

UPDATE: It gets even worse.  My federal return was accepted but my state one was rejected.  It gave me an error message about ""Line 14 of the Itemized Deduction Worksheet Doesn't Equal Lines 10 thru 13,"" but if it's talking about schedule A, then when I look at schedule A it's supposed to be line 15 equals 10 through 14.  So, there's either a bug in the program, a bug in the state's, or it's a different form that I can't find.  Okay, so that's why they have support, right?  If only!  They have 2 chats for support: technical support and tax advice.  I spent about 2 hours today (most of the time waiting and waiting, and I got up once to go to the bathroom and get a cup of coffee while waiting on the chat and it booted me out!) trying to ask them what the error message is actually referring to so I can figure out why it got rejected.  The tax advice people tell me I have to talk to technical support to get and answer, and the technical support people tell me I have to talk to the tax advice people!  I want know: If I mail in my state return, will it be rejected for the same issue, or is it a computer glitch?  I've never had a return rejected with TurboTax, and the one time I had to contact support they actually gave me answers, I wish I had just sucked it up and paid the TurboTax bait-and-switch extrusion fee.

Original review:
This has got to be the worst user interface I can ever remember using. Ever. I have been using TurboTax for several years, and because of the famous change that means I would have had to pay twice as much to be able to do a schedule C, I decided to switch to this out of principle. I thought to myself, ""Gee, Turbotax has a horrible user interface, it can't be any worse, right?"" WRONG! If you have everything perfectly prepared, like you would if you were walking in to an accountant's office, then I think this program would work fine for you. But if you're like me, the biggest reason I like to use tax software at home rather than walking into an accountant's office is that I like to be able to enter stuff in while I'm preparing it, and I want to do it in the order I want to do it in. I wish I had sucked it up and just bought TurboTax Home & Business. Even though I've gone through everything, I am contemplating purchasing the ripoff TurboTax anyway just to make sure I didn't miss anything. While this software does offer maximum refund guarantee, it his the disclaimer, ""must not be due to differences in the data supplied by you,"" what's distinctly missing is, ""unless data supplied by you was different because our user interface is horrible.""

This software might prove useful to me in the future, however...If I ever need an example of the worst possible way to design a user interface.",Horrible User Interface and errors

4780,1,H&R Block,34.6,"02 6, 2015","I am...well, was...a long-time Turbo Tax user. Bought it for the 2014 tax season, but then returned in upon seeing the brouhaha over Intuit's fun and games with the in-app purchases/upgrades required to do my taxes.

So I gave H&R Block a try. Well, in retrospect, I wish I had just stuck with Turbo Tax and paid the in-app upgrade fees. At this point, those fees of $25...even $50, or $100, or $1,000 (well, not that much)...are something I'd gladly pay to get back the hours I've spent with H&R Block support.

But let me start at the beginning. It was easy to download and install the H&R Block program. It quickly imported my Turbo Tax file from 2013 and saved me a lot of data entry (name, address, etc.). The interface struck me as a bit nicer than Turbo Tax - it's less cluttered.

I have to do a resident and a non-resident return. Since the program includes only one state, I had to buy and download the second one. Wow, $39.95 plus tax...ouch. If I recall correctly from last year, the extra state in Turbo Tax is $10-$20 cheaper. Oh well, no choice but to buy it.

After installing the second state and then three-ish hours of data entry, the returns were done. I previewed them and checked them against last year's returns...all looked good.

So, on to e-filing. The e-file confirmation screen is showing me only my federal and resident state returns. Where's the non-resident return? Oh, via the ""Take Me To"" icon at the top, I find an ""e-file state return"" option and go there. It lovingly informs me ""You can't e-file your state return because either your state or this program doesn't support it."" Huh?

So I go for the online support via chat, and wait almost 45 minutes for a representative to come online. We go back-and-forth, back-and-forth and it's clear he's reading (well, typing) from a script. Didn't really get anything helpful. He ended up telling me I should wait for my *federal* return to be accepted and then the program would let me file my non-resident return. Really? Why on earth would that be? But ok, since it's the beginning of February I can wait a few days, I suppose. (Boy, really wish I stuck with Turbo Tax at this point.)

A day or two later the ""federal return accepted"" email hits my inbox. Joy! Now I can go back and e-file my non-resident return and get the whole 2014 tax filing thing behind me. Er, nope...trying to e-file still gives me the same blasted ""You can't e-file your state return because either your state or this program doesn't support it."" Argh.

So this time I try calling. Another insane wait of around 45 minutes. (Can't imagine what the wait times will be in April!) The representative on the phone is nice but isn't able to fix the problem. She gives me a case number and says my problem is being escalated and I'll hear back from their escalation team within 48 hours.

The escalation team calls and leaves a message. I returned their call today and had pretty much the same experience I did last time - I describe my problem (yet) again, get put on hold, the representative comes back after a while to ask another question, I get put on hold, .... you get the idea. The rep ended up recommending that I *print* and mail my non-resident return. Ugh, really? So I ask can I talk to more of a software engineering type support person, one with knowledge of the internals of the program? She says that's another escalation, which she's happy to do, and that 2nd escalation team will call me back within 48-72 hours. Given my experience to this point, I decline and say I quit, I'll just print and mail it.

Today (tax filing day) I finally got them in (at least I think they are) but I actually had our taxes done over two weeks ago. Here's the story:
First it had a problem with 1095-A Health Insurance Marketplace Statement, something about the monthly premium amount of second lowest cost silver plan, which is all zeros on the form the IRS sent us and the way I filled it out. After calling HR Block, getting the wrong Dept., waiting for hours and finally telling the clueless girl ""Don't take this personally but I don't believe what you just told me, can I speak to a supervisor"". I got a supervisor that explained how I had to click on the ""Learn. more"" button. ""No not that one the other one""! That took me to a link to the Affordable care Act website that was supposed to explain how to fill it out. Somehow I got through that, don't even ask me how because I was totally burnt out by then. I got to the e-file portion and had everything filled in: bank routing number, PIN I had to call for etc. Clicked the ""file taxes"" button........but NOOOOO!!! It paused and downloaded an update! After the update it did another accuracy test and came up with this message:

Inconsistency:
since you're claiming the self-employed health insurance deduction and have marketplace health insurance, your return requires additional calculations that aren't part of our program. To file an accurate return, we recommend you complete your return with an H&R Block tax professional.
You must fix this problem before filing.

Called HR Block back. They said I had to either take my taxes to an HR office, or I could do the online ""Best Of Both Worlds"" where you do your taxes online and a Tax Professional looks at it and advises you,... for $99. They gave me a code so it would be free. Of course you are supposed to be able to upload last years tax file but that didn't work - got an error message the the file was too large. Had to enter everything AGAIN. On top of everything else, when I got done with the online version it came up with a result $60 less that the PC version! Yes I'm super pissed off at HR Block.
Imagine getting this message: ""your return requires additional calculations that aren't part of our program"". This is just a plain stupid glitch since It asked about it, said it was deductible, and entered it as a deduction! Deducting heath insurance premiums as a business expense is not even a new thing, has nothing to do with the Affordable Care Act!

But it does not end there.
So I mentioned that they had given me a code so this ""Best Of Both Worlds"" would be free (which is good because in this world you do all the work, then you get a one liner back from your Tax Professional saying ""Your Taxes are ready to file. Thanks"" and a bill for $150.00 because they tack on filing fees.
So I got to the point where I entered the code, got a total of .27 and had to enter my credit card. But because nothing can go right with is return, it took two trys to enter the credit card and the second time it forgot about the free code and charged me the $150 anyways.

Given how common this is likely to be; i.e., if I wasn't self-employed I wouldn't be buying ACA, this is a serious failure - why would I buy the software in the first place?  Evidently, the problem has to do with the recursive nature of the ACA subsidy - it calcs your subsidy eligibility based on your AGI minus the cost of insurance, so to determine the deductibility of that insurance it has to figure out what your subsidy is and what your net payment is, but that is once again based on your net AGI - so its a circular function.

It was buried within a long list of more obscure income generating things.  Other software packages are better at walking you through and alerting you to what kind of income each section is about. Furthermore, the cost of the state returns is expensive.  After the free state, every other state is $60, first for the $40 software, then the $19.99 filing fee.  So if you are one person, with one state, it may be fine.  But if you have multiple state returns, or multiple family members using the software, it adds up.  It is also the most restrictive software for free state filing,.  For some reason, H&R block decided not only must your income be below a certain amount, you also have to be 53 years old and under for the free e-filing.  How is that NOT age discrimination?

You can file in this situation with TurboTax and TaxAct -- both programs can perform the calculations that HR Block has chosen not to include. TurboTax is probably the better choice, but self-employed individuals need to buy their most expensive software version-- whereas TaxAct is the most economical choice but may be perceived as less user friendly by some users.  It might be a good idea to start with the ""free"" online versions to explore the interface of each program before deciding on a program.

But bottom line on H&R Block is that it simply cannot be used in this situation.",Self employed?  Purchased health insurance off the exchange? This software won't work.

As of 03/29/15 they have no updates so it appears these problems will not be fixed.

2. Help system and online help links don't work. When you click on the help links the program opens Internet Explorer even when it's not the default browser, then it starts giving website errors like ""Unexpected Error. Please close your browser and try again"". It looks like the program has hardcoded links for Internet Explorer and then the website is broken.

3. Technical support is a joke with extremely long wait times. If you try to go to their customer support website for a chat session you will watch ""waiting for next available agent"" for hours, and if you call on the phone you will sit on hold for long period too. The product support appears to be broken too.

Bottom line - it claims to be a ""Premium"" version but doesn't go through the interview process correctly - it skips many itemized deductions and keeps wanting you to use the standard deduction even when it's much less than the itemized deduction total.  Instructions are wrong and taxes are calculated incorrectly for many of the basic schedules.

I've used this product for many years and this is the first year it has not worked properly. It looks like they tried to streamline the product and destroyed much of the needed functionality.  Very disappointing software quality,

It may be time to switch to TurboTax...

Will update review as I continue to wait for answers to problems with this software.

Update: The chat support and phone support which the website claims are 24/7 are actually only available during business hours on Monday - Friday.  Any other time the phone line just gives you an automated attendant that is useless because it can only answer a few questions and always refers you back to the incomplete help files in the program.  The chat support just sits and keeps sending ""You will be connected to the next available agent"" and will continue this for hours. The website says ""Anticipated wait time 0"" for both, so the website is also broken.  When you have to print the forms, make corrections and then override the program to ""use the whole form"" just like you were filling it out manually there is something wrong with the software. It looks like it is designed for a lower level program and cannot handle the situations listed for the Premium version.  I finally got taxes prepared, but ended up using the software to manually fill out the forms and override some of the calculations because it has trouble adding and subtracting properly.  End conclusion - this was more of a hassle this year than I've ever had with this product.  It  seems that H&R block has joined the race to mediocrity.  They even look like they're turning the premium product into an advertising banner because when you get set to e-file it comes up with a gift card deal for ""selected retailers"".

4903,1,H&R Block,40.95,"02 24, 2015","I had to call several times to speak to H&R Block. Two of those times the automated system hung up on me because it wasn't able to determine what to do with my call.

My first contact was how to input HSA information. I told the person what was on my form and asked how to input it. She had no idea. Using the software got me to some point where it felt I was a Railroad Worker. While the tech kept looking, I googled in a browser and found info that the software was wrong and that I should input the data in another way. One strike against H&R Block.

My second contact with H&R Block was because entering my wife's personal business information appeared as my personal business information when I went to review the actual forms. As anyone who has used the software knows, there are hours of screens to get through when filling in all of the personal business data, so all I wanted to do was change that from my business to my wife's business - but it was not something I could edit with their software. I contacted them to ask how to get that changed. Their only solution was to delete it, and reinput everything. Strike Two against H&R Block.

When I entered the data as my wife's business, the total tax we were responsible for increased dramatically ($3500). I looked over the information several times, and it always appeared the same and accurate. I am not sure where that discrepancy came from. Strike Three against H&R Block.

At this time, I would have simply gone back with Turbo Tax, but the software has to be paid for in advance (unlike Turbo Tax - where you pay for it when you file).

So, I filed anyway.

To save a copy of my return, the H&R Block software has a link to let you save your completed forms to PDF. I have the full version of Adobe Acrobat installed, but the software would not recognize this. Instead, to actually save my own data, I had to install their Spamware filled PDF995 software.

I found H&R Premium clumsy and hard to navigate.  This product would probably be fine for someone with a less complicated life than mine.
Examples:
1) Import from last years Turbo Tax, did not bring along depreciation method and history info on rental properties.
2) I like to use the software to document every significant entry, I create a backup list with check dates, check #, amount as detail-list.
H&R supports this, although poorly, H&R keeps these detail backup documents by form-line-number.  If you have more than one copy of any form, H&R presents a list of all the lists by form-line-number, you have to guess which form ( which property ) each list supports.  When you open one of these lists to see what it contains, H&R switches the focus to whatever property that list references. The dilemma is that on many screens there is no on-screen indication of with which property you are currently working; when you select the wrong list you are unknowingly switched to a different property.  Makes for a mess.

The process makes it easy to complete a tax return by prompting you for the forms and information needed to complete the return.  The questions are very thorough to ensure you get the most from your return.  But there are issues.

This years program was unable to file a return for me.  It has a bug with the 1095-A form for the Health Insurance Marketplace.  During the interview, it allowed me to enter the information but when I went to file it gave me an error that said column B was incomplete.  After double checking everything I tried to contact customer support using the online chat.  It warned me there was an 11 minute wait.  Two hours later a service agent entered the chat.  They were slow to respond throughout the chat, but did go as far as to have me upload the return for them to review.  They said there was no problem with my return but they got the same error.  After one and a half hours I was offered two choices, wait another month and it may be fixed in an update or I can have a refund.  This software failed at the most basic thing it is sold to do, file a federal return.  Because of this I am forced to give it one star, ask for a refund (another 4-6 weeks wait) and look for a new program to file my taxes.

There are a couple other cons to the software.  Although you can e-file 5 federal returns for free, they charge $19.95 to e-file state.  Which is ironic since e-filing is free through the government, so this is purely and H&R Block fee.  At least one state e-file should be included when buying the state program.  They are also trying to steer people to collect their returns in the form of gift cards with a 10% bonus.  This is presented when you go to file and there is only one button to say Yes to this option, I found the No option in small print lower on the page.  Unless you are planning to use the give card immediately, I would recommend against using this option.  They know that 15% of the average gift card value goes unused.  It is another way for them to profit from your return.

H&R Block state returns are NOT seamlessly integrated as they are in TurboTax.  My husband works partially in New Jersey and we reside in New York.  We get a credit on our New York return for the taxes paid to New Jersey.

After preparing the H&R Block New Jersey return, the New York return had no idea that we were entitled to a credit for NJ taxes paid.  Consequently, I had to jump back and forth between the NY and NJ returns and manually enter the NJ numbers in the NY return!  This is in stark contrast to TurboTax.  In prior years, after working on our TurboTax NJ return, our NY return knew exactly what to deduct.  I'm a tax professional and I knew to look for the credit on our NY return.  Someone less familiar with income taxes might not.

Another issue arose when allocating wages on the NJ return.  I found a work-around that involved overriding the data on the NJ 1040 non-resident form.  Once again, TurboTax made this easy in prior years.

I saved/closed/re-opened the returns to see if NY and NJ somehow recalculated and were integrated,.  No such luck.  I plan on doing a thorough, line-by-line review of the state returns to see that there are other issues not yet discovered.  I'll also probably return to TurboTax next year despite their pricing issues for 2014.

4933,1,H&R Block,40.95,"01 17, 2015","As of today, the Schedule E has fatal bugs. It incorrectly imported last years Turbotax return data - completely messing up the depreciation schedules for my rentals. For example, last year (2013) the depreciation on one of the properties was $53,681, which was correct. H&R Block calculated this years depreciation for the same property at $176,083!! It messed up the depreciation numbers for my other two rental properties as well, zeroing one out completely and incorrectly calculating the other.
The software gets confused when you have more than one rental, and incorrectly handles the itemized lists, refusing to display some, and bringing up the wrong list for others. It appears to only display itemized lists for the first property entered.
This is the buggiest software I've ever purchased - I'm going back to Turbotax.

Jan 23,15 update:
Downloaded the updated software today - it's improved but still messes up the imported depreciation schedules. Many line items are duplicated and you have to go through them line by line manually to delete the duplicates!! In my case, I had to manually go through over 250 line items.
Clicking on a box to bring up detail lists is better with Turbotax - when you click on the input box to create or view an itemized list, you get a list of every itemized list on the return even though all but one are unrelated. You have to manually determine which one is the correct list to open. Turbotax just brings up the requested list without making you locate and select it (again) from the long list.
Unfortunately, all the hours of work I prior to the update had to be re-entered!! So, H&R improved with the update, but still has critical bugs dealing with importing Schedule E depreciation data from 2013 TurboTax.
Just a comment - before retiring I was a Senior Software Manager for a Fortune 500 company. If I had allowed software to be released in this condition with critical bugs like these - I would have been terminated for cause, along with the Software Test Manager.

4942,1,H&R Block,45.95,"04 18, 2015","Edit: 9/2015 (Originally given 4 ""stars"")

I gave a pretty decent review of this product, initially. It seemed adequate, but a bit more cumbersome than Intuit's product. I had used TurboTax for years. Then, Intuit started getting greedy and began packaging forms in each of their products so that consumers would have to buy the next ""highest"" version in order to get the one form they needed.

I finished my 2014 taxes ahead of schedule. I sat back...fat, dumb, and happy. I had run the accuracy check, as recommended. What could go wrong?

The IRS told me. In August, I received a terse notice from the IRS that I had ""not yet filed"" my 2014 return. I had the certified return receipt and thought their assertion quite mad. Ah...there were ""missing forms"" in what I had mailed and the IRS position is (properly) that a return is not considered ""filed"" until all of the forms needed are provided by the taxpayer. The nice (grumble) tax man explained what forms were missing and I opened the program to see what had gone awry. I ran the accuracy check first...

...""Congratulations!"", I was told. Everything was there and the calculations were flawless.

I manually looked for the missing forms and could not find them. The program never guided me to them, so they were blank. I had to re-file/amend my return because H&R Block's program doesn't really check for completeness. I had to manually override some of the forms in order to file for 2014.

I will not be buying H&R Block's software again. Intuit might be greedy...but their program is flawless. H&R Block's is pure rubbish.

END of Edit

I suppose my title is a bit confusing. Sorta like saying, ""The food here is lousy, but you get big servings.""

Ahhh...tax time. It's conveniently six months (in either direction) from Election Day. It's that special time of the year when I dream of giving my favorite politicians...a barbed wire enema.

I once used TurboTax. They began nagging me to buy their newest product as soon as I printed or e-filed the current year. Then, about every November, my email box began to load up with 'reminders' from Intuit. Each year, TurboTax got shorter on features. This meant I was continually 'upgrading' (In English, ""spending more money"".) to keep the same features/forms I had last year. TurboTax then started shennanigans of removing features/forms I needed from products. No, not just 'obscure' forms...forms most people need. Bad, bad Intuit!! Changing features and selling upgrades to put more money in their nasty little pocketses. We hates Intuit. Phooey!

I decided to give H&R Block's product a run. It was about 50% of the cost of TurboTax (which is, in my experience, always an estimate since you find out you need a 'more advanced' (wink-wink) version of TurboTax only AFTER you coughed up for the one you bought last year because the forms have 'moved' to the new 'Super Premier Deluxe Exclusive for (a few) Homes, (select) Businesses, and (some) Hobbits' version...""available for a limited time"").

The (Mac) download went flawlessly. To my immense surprise, the product launched without a hitch. TurboTax NEVER launched properly until I made at least two calls to their support people (who were always helpful and pleasant).

The Block 'interview' was not as sleek as TurboTax. The graphics are rougher. You get 'checklists' (which are sometimes poorly explained) instead of the sleek TurboTax 'interview' conducted by a barely dressed Russian super-model. But, if you are of normal intelligence and don't need dancing pandas to entertain you as you figure capital gains, the Block program is more than sufficient in getting information out of you. Editing information already entered is a bit cumbersome (trying to find stuff is like playing 'Where's Waldo?'). But, the program gets the job done.

Especially helpful, is the 'Cook Your Books' feature where you can hide investments and minimize oil profits using the special 'Tax Chicanery' button. JUST KIDDING, Mr. IRS guy. (That's a feature only found in another vendor's, ""Koch Brothers Special Edition""...sale-priced this week at $4.7-billion as a download.)

The Block program also offers features familiar to TurboTax refugees, like the 'audit meter' that graphically shows your risk of being subjected to an IRS-paid colonoscopy. (I call this meter...'The Mendacity Meter'.) Calculations are spot on. The program does a pretty good job of ferreting out forms you may need, but would otherwise forget to file. It even made quick work of new forms and information related to Oh, Bummer! Care.

I'll probably use this product again next year. I used to spend over $800 to a professional who would complete my personal and business taxes. So, this created a substantial savings for me...that I can now, instead, spend on some new tax or 'fee' levied by those friendly scoundrels in Washington.

So, if you do your own business taxes (or are amused by getting spankings from total strangers)...I highly recommend H&R Block's tax software when ""It's that time of the year"". (Rumor has it that the aces in DC plan to launch their own, IRS-based tax software next year. They were going to launch for this tax year...but their supplier for high-voltage nipple clamps ran into manufacturing delays.)",Edited: Beware of its False assurances!

4981,1,H&R Block,45.95,"02 20, 2015","(See updates at bottom of review.)

So far, pretty good. Not finished with my taxes yet, so I may update this review.

Downloaded from H&R Block's web site. Amazon has cheaper prices!

Amazon says H&R Block will give unlimited tax advice; H&R Block's site says we get one tax chat for free.

Unlike other reviews here, I had no problem installing the software on my Mac running Yosemite 10.10.2.

H&R Block's user interface seems cleaner and easier to get around than Turbo Tax's. But, there also seems to be less guidance. For me, I am fine with this and I think I prefer it. But, sometimes the software refers one to a Federal booklet for advicenot cool. Still, I did not need to do that.

I tried importing info from E*Trade, but got an error message. Called H&R tech support. They answered quickly and sent me to tech support. Had to wait quite a while for the second person to answer. They created a case number and were supposed to get back to me in 24 to 48 hours. They never did. But, 48 hours later, I tried importing from E*Trade again. This time the software informed me that E*Trade did not have my forms ready; they would be available Tuesday of next week. So, H&R Block must have fixed their error code.

I also have a small business. At the end of the program, I was informed that the program needed an update to handle my situation: something to do with my health care and being self-employed. I don't know if this is a delay because the government has not finalized the rules, or if H&R Block has not finished this part of the program. In any case, the program said the update would be available March 15. March 15! That's only a month before taxes are due.

Still, overall, I am happy with this program so far. I am tired of Turbo Tax. I do like this cleaner interface. Turbo Tax is owned by Intuit, and they have never treated Mac people very well, so it is good not to use any of their products, I think.

UPDATE (31 March 2015): I have been waiting for software updates so I can file my return. They promised my situation would be addressed in an update two weeks ago. Now, they say it will be in the next update on April 2. This is getting awfully close to the tax deadline. I don't like pushing things so close. What is my situation? Just, I am self-employed and signed up for the Affordable Care Act through California's exchange. I would suppose there must be many people in my situation. I don't think H&R Block can say they are waiting for government updates. They just have to get going themselves. Still, I am happy to be away from Intuit. They care nothing for Macintosh users. But! If H&R Block misses the next self-imposed deadline, I may change my tune.

UPDATE (02 April 2015): Just downloaded the last update. Finally. But! The problem was not fixed!!! H&R Block said I can wait for the next update, or pay them $20 and have one of their professionals finish my return!

UPDATE (02 April 2105): H&R Block said there may not be a fix. They said I could re-enter (RE-ENTER!!!) my info online and one of their professionals would finish it for free.

UPDATE (04 April 2015): So, there is no update coming. They have a program called the Best Of The Best. in which the customer completes their return online, and then H&R Block finishes it. That way, they can handle anything their program cannot. Some troubles with this: I started with their desktop version. I have to now re-enter everything in their online version. Their online version would not import last year's Turbo Tax return. It tried, but failed! Customer support said they would refund me $20 to cover the cost of their Best Of The Best program. But, the program actually cost $25. I also came across a problem with my state return. When I got to the end of the process, the program asked me if I wanted to file my state return with them for $40 more! I had already paid for their program that would cover me state, too. Now they wanted more because of the Best Of The Best program. If I clicked no, then the next option was to delete my California return. What about letting me go back to the regular return, instead? I guess that was not an option because their regular program would not complete my Federal return correctly. I suppose if I had called Customer Service they may have refunded this price, too. But, as it is, I have now paid an additional $45 simply because their software would not handle my situation, that being Self-Employed and getting State Exchange health care. I suspect that Turbo Tax could have handled that, but I don't know for sure.",Could not calculate self-employment and state healthcare properly. Had to re-enter all my info online and go through H&R Block.

I ended up with an incorrect return as the software neither prompted me or picked up my previous year state tax refund and so I am currently completing a 1040x by hand.
The MD state package is risible, to paraphrase: ""The state laws are kind of difficult, yuk, yuk, read the list of stuff we don't know how to figure and sort it out yourself"". I mean isn't this the point of an expert tax system?
The final pain was that having purchased this package and having to figure my state tax myself, HR block then demanded $20 to electronically file it!

4987,1,H&R Block,45.95,"02 4, 2015","We switched from Turbo Tax this year after reading the reviews about content and pricing changes.  Thus, far I'm too impressed with H&R Block tax software.  The helpful explanations seem a bit more sketchy than what I recall from Turbo Tax.  I needed to register into the H&R Block website for getting further detailed help.  Went to the website once for a question but it did not really answer my question.  Too often the program suggests that I read the IRS tax form for further guidance.

My current big complaint is that it seems to have crashed after I completed about 90% of my tax reporting form.  Now when I try to re-open my  saved tax document I get an error message that tells me that I should try to update the software and try opining my file again.  When I tried to update the software I got the message that I am fully updated and no further updates are scheduled until mid February.  I'm afraid that after I update in mid February that it will be of no help since there seems to be no reason for the crash.  If True and if I must start a new form again from the beginning, then this program should get one or zero stars.

My final comments after finally completing two returns.  Never could get back into my first saved return and had to redo it from scratch.  Did a second return for a family member that was really basic.  The program did accuracy check and said everything was fine.  Despite the program saying everything was correct the State return got rejected saying there was an error.  Returned to the form and told to correct the error but then again told everything was correct and there were no errors to correct.

Next year we will be using a different program.",So far... Not very happy
4988,1,H&R Block,45.95,"02 3, 2015","Bugs everywhere. As a software engineer, I can tell that whoever released this software should be fired.
I'm using MacOS 10.10.2 version. Installed and updated fine.
Now the problems:
1. Importing the second W2 crashes the software. Consistently. Every time. No matter which one is the second one ( so it doesn't depend on where you are importing it from). Importing 3rd W2 worked after 10 retries.
2. The error checker highlights a ""mistake"", a zero in the state tax field. Yes, I didn't pay state taxes this year n that W2 ( only 2K of income), why this software is forcing me to write something other than 0?
3. The program crashed a couple of more times at random points.
4. On Retina display, some Fonts look like they are from stone age.

Right now, the only way to complete my taxes is to manually enter all the W2s, and skip the error checking , which defeats the purpose of having a software to do taxes.
I'll wait for a couple of days, and if there is no update - I'll try to get my money back from them or through the bank.

However, for tax year 2014, given the huge difference in price between that Turbotax product and H&R Block's Premium and Business software (over $100 at the time of my purchase decision), I decided to give Amazon's PC-downloadable version of H&R Block's product a try.
I expected to incur some ""learning curve"" time the first time using H&R Blocks product. However, I grossly underestimated the amount of time I would ultimately end up wasting and did not expect the H&R Block Business software to be as kludgy as it is. A few examples of the difficulties: (a) I figured out through some significant trial and error that the initial installation requires shutting down your anti-virus software firewall (the HR Block software froze several times until I figured this out, and I had to restart my computer each time to unfreeze the software), (b) processing of entries is much slower than in Turbotax, (c) the interview process is not nearly as seamless or as intuitive or as complete as the Turbotax interview process, nor is it is as visually attractive, and H&R Block's interview does not cause you to fill in every relevant blank in the 1065 (for example, the TMP's phone number); (c) the method of identifying and correcting errors in the H&R Block product is cumbersome; (d) the error review doesn't seem to pick everything up (for example, if you follow the interview process, which seems to force you to identify partner or partners having 50% or more interests before completing K-1s, you will end up reporting each of those partners twice in Schedule B-1, Part II with the result, if you have two partners at 50% interests each that you can end with a total of 200%-and the review process does not pick this up as an error); (e) you do not receive emails about efiling status and must go into the software to find out about it instead; (f) at least as to MN, the state form (in MN, Form M3 and related forms) seems to be something of an afterthought-there is no interview and you cannot rely on the software to complete all the blanks and calculations and review the entries for errors (it seems that you essentially have to use the software for MN like you would a fill-in-the blank pdf form); and (g) you cannot efile with H&R Block's software in a significant number of states, including MN (in fairness, though, I have not compared H&R Block's list with the list of states Turbotax can be used to file partnership returns in this year).
Even having now moved up the learning curve as to H&R Blocks Business tax software, I'll probably return to using Turbotax for Form 1065 use next year, particularly if Turbotax gets to be a little more competitive on price.",Kludgy partnership return software with shortcomings compared to Turbotax equivalent

Literally 12 hours later of just trying to get the business filing done via this software, I'm throwing in the towel.  While I wait for my newly purchased Turbo Tax software to install, I find that I have some time on my hands to write this review.

My biggest gripe is that the software is not intuitive or easy to get around.  There are a ton of different supporting docs that need to be populated and the software does a decent job of routing you through them, but good luck ever finding those docs again.  Other issues:

1) can't print a single form and every time I try to print, all the tax forms and supporting docs are sent to my printer.  I found that I have to generate a PDF and then print the form that I want.  There may be a way to do this, but again, not intuitive.
2) the error checking discovers errors and sends you to the form which has errors.  The form which has errors is not editable, so it links you to one of the 'feeder' forms, which again is not editable.  That form links you back to the form with the errors.  So how do you fix the error?  still no clue.
3) there are no explanations on anything.  The only help I could find was to kick you over to the government site.  If I could understand the IRS' explanation of tax code, I wouldn't have purchased software.

There are errors in the return because I can't figure out where to add the right information.

It returns cryptic errors without good explanation of what is expected/needed.  The State return is a nightmare. If you don't know the specific forms you will need and are not an accountant well versed in the state return for your state, it's pretty iffy. I have no idea if the info automatically put into the forms I hope I needed will be right or not. I am filing for a small partnership with very small income.  I will definitely spring for the extra money to go back to TurboTax Business next year.

Follow Up: I attempted to use the Premium Home that came with this to finish my personal taxes. I was fine with the federal, but when the state (PA) came up it imported my spouse's income from the federal return incorrectly (10% of the figure.). I contacted customer support via chat and they told me that I must ""overide"" the entry to correct it, and that after doing so, I would no longer be able to e-file my returns. What A CROCK! They have ""escalated"" my complaint (whatever that means) and someone will contact me in 1-3 days via unspecified means (they asked for phone, email and snailmail).

I bought this software to prepare tax returns and K-1s for a multi member LLC because TurboTax was extremely limited and could not even support basic scenarios like the mid-year transfer of a member interest, or ANY member interest held by a foreign entity. While the H&R Block software supported the forms and logic necessary, their interface is from the 1980's,VERY difficult to use, and requires a high degree of familiarity with tax prep to be at all useful.  It is also full of bugs, can't even display its interface correctly on a standard windows monitor (see picture), and worst of all, has a critical bug, reported by multiple users, that prevents the ability to eFile New York State tax returns (which is required by law by NYS).  Tech support is useless, and revealed that they don't even have a bug tracking database, so EVERY bug must be researched from scratch for every user that reports it, as though they were the first person to report it.

Return #1 Preparing an 1120S return. Everything works fine until I print out the return for review & find it is not transferring an entry onto the shareholder's K-1. I contact tech support chat and eventually get the answer that I need to wait for a program update to fix the error. Several weeks later I am still waiting for a program update to fix the error and cannot get out a correct K-1 yet.

Return #2:  Attempting to prepare an 1120S return their software gives an error when we input a form K-1 that we received. The return is prepared correctly but the program flags a False error. Contacting their tech support chat they said they could not resolve the issue & would escalate the issue and have someone contact me. The chat abruptly terminated & no one has contacted me. I contacted them again through chat & we had to start over. This time they said they could not offer a solution but told me the next step is to contact their tax advice chat - they can help. So I contacted their tax advice chat & was told immediately that they do not offer support to the business program. So back to program support chat again the next morning. This time I explained the problem and added that as a test I had changed the entry that caused the error from a loss to a gain and the error went away. Her response was they do not give tax advice, but I could contact their tax advice chat. I tried to further clarify and explain that I did not need tax advice, I only gave her the information that changing the input from a loss to a gain eliminated the error to help her troubleshoot. The correct input is a loss but their software has a problem and can't seem to handle the entry on the K-1 as a loss. Unbelievably her response was ""What is K-1"""". I give up. If a program support tech for a business tax program doesn't know what a K-1 is there is no hope.

My first issue was with the installation.  I spent a lot of time installing, uninstalling, and re-installing the software because I could not locate the shortcuts for the business software. The software appeared to install correctly and as it turned out, I found the shortcuts under my ""admin"" user instead of the user I was logged in as.  The business program also requires that you run the program with elevated privileges.

I also do not like the fact that the user ""data"" for the software is located within my system folder under Program Files which does not appear to be configurable. This introduces difficulties for backups, saving to the cloud, etc.  Although backups are still possible by other means, I should be able to choose where the data is located and the default location should be outside of system folders.

And finally, I've spent too much time trying to make the software work for a 1041 tax return on a simple pass-thru trust that receives royalties. I have used turbo tax in the past and have also prepared this tax return manually and I have come to the conclusion that manually is much simpler than trying to navigate around this software.

The interview process is sort of a joke as you end up searching for information in the ""forms"".  And once in the forms, you attempt to enter a number and it tells you that is a calculated field from another form or worksheet.  Although they do have a link to the form or worksheet that the calculation is from, you end up getting lost in forms and worksheets and ultimately have a hard time finding your way back to where you were.  I just spent way too much time trying to make the software work and come up with similar numbers/calculations as my previous tax returns.

By the way, I started the ""manual"" method after working with this software to compare how much time it would take and how much easier it was.  One of the main reasons I purchased the software was for the interview process in asking me the right questions so I wouldn't have to search through forms.

Maybe it wouldn't be a big deal if H&R Block Business was as easy as TurboTax Business, but it's not - it requires you to learn some tax code.
----------------------------------------
Here's some examples of some of the questions:

Election of Partnership Level Tax Treatment
For the tax year for which you are filing, will the partnership file Form 8893, Election of Partnership Level Tax Treatment, or an election statement under section 6231(a)(1)(B)(ii) for partnership-level tax treatment?

Section 754 Election
Is the partnership making, or had it previously made (and not revoked), a section 754 election?

Optional Basis Adjustment
For this tax year, did the partnership make an optional basis adjustment under section 743(b) or 734(b)?
---------------------------

Yes, they provide more details on the tax sections mentioned when you click the help links, but still I like the questions to be a little easier to understand and not be in legalese.

For me, the software was cheaper that TurboTax, but the amount of time I wasted reading about the different tax sections, as well as the time I wasted having to manually enter the info (instead of importing it) ended up making it cost more to do my taxes with H&R Block.

I suppose it really comes down to how much you value your time.  If you don't mind spending the additional time and making manual entries and reading about tax code than it may not be as a big of a deal for you.",H&R Block Business Doesn't Import from Turbo Tax
5116,1,H&R Block,40.95,"01 10, 2015","This software is terrible!  Won't import K-1s and blocks direct data input onto Form 8865.

I bought the 2013 and 2014 versions of this software to once & for all finally enter the K-1 data for each partner. Huge mistake. The 2014 version would not import the 2013 K-1 data, requiring tedious re-entry for all 12 partners.  Worse yet, there was no universal query which could have populated data for all 12; instead, there was a laborious questionnaire for each K-1, asking the same irrelevant questions.  This could have easily been corrected by designing a universal K-1 page, which would have invoked the particular question only for those obscure cases where the question would apply.  In the past, I would download the 1065 and individual K-1s from the IRS web-site.  That turned out to have been a 2 hour exercise, while the H&R approach required 2+1/2 hours.  Unbelievably poor design.

Also, I could not bypass the queries to go directly to the Form 8825.  This was using the button to go directly to the form -- which then provided me a message that I had to go back to the 1065 query. Again, most of the query questions were irrelevant to a small business LLC performing property management.  This also wound up taking more time than downloading the 8825 from the IRS.  I wound up spending nearly 4 hours this year instead of the usual 2 to 2+1/2.

I would recommend that users try another software type, or just stick with the IRS downloads. I know that I will.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

H&R Block should consider getting some user feedback to help guide them into making this software more small business user friendly.  Perhaps a front page interview which asks:

-  if there were any partnership member & ownership percentage changes from previous years.
-  questions about the type of business (real estate management is much different than manufacturing, agriculture, or retail)",This software is terrible!  Won't import K-1s and blocks direct data input onto Form 8865.

Work around: Open Task Manager to end all H&R Block processes. Installation of the Business portion may finish because it seems pretty fast. Go into your Program Files folder and rename the HRBlock2013 folder. Do the same thing in the Program File (x86) folder if you're on a 64 bit system.

Prior to purchasing the H&R Block Deluxe version I called their tech support line and asked them if the Deluxe version had the capability to download pertinent tax data from my two investment houses, one being Wells Fargo  they assured me that the software is configured to perform that download from Wells Fargo.
Based on their assurance I purchased H&R Block Deluxe and proceeded to enter pertinent data. When it came to the downloading of tax data from Wells Fargo the H&R Block Deluxe software offered no link and I was unable to download the data. I first called Wells Fargo and learned from them that H&R Block had not set up the link with Wells Fargo to download the data I needed. I then called H&R Block and after much discussion they confirmed that the link is not in place and that Id need to enter the data manually. So, either H&R Block tech support personnel are lacking in knowledge of their own product or they lied to me to get a sale.
I proceeded to enter the data manually and then decided to review the final forms on screen prior to printing and filing. I discovered that H&R Block Deluxe failed to transfer some data from worksheet(s) to the final form(s). The result of this failure was that tax due calculations performed by H&R Block Deluxe were not accurate and had I filed the forms I would have been liable for tax due and penalties for inaccurate tax filings with both the Federal Government and with my State Government.
I next decided to print the results using the PDF printer supplied by H&R Block (you must use their PDF printer, Acrobat or other software based PDF printers will not work).  The result was that worksheets and cover sheets were cutoff at the lower page margin and text/data that should have wrapped to a subsequent page was lost. The data at the top of subsequent pages was also missing. Also  from top-to-bottom of worksheets data was missing on the right side of the page. The right margin was at, approximately, 3  from the right edge of the page. Bottom line  the printed documents were unsuitable for filing taxes.
In an effort to resolve the printing deficiencies in H&R Block Deluxe I called H&R Block Tech support (Thursday 2/26 AM). My first go-around lasted about 1  hours with no resolution. The call was disconnected while performing a computer modification instruction given to me by the technician. I called back and spent an additional 1  hours on the line, but with no solution. The technician finalized the discussion stating that she had exhausted all her resources as to how to resolve the issue, but that she would escalate this issue to the next level of support so that they can better assist me  she promised me that I would receive a call back within 24 to 48 business hours.
The H&R Block technical support office is open 7 days a week, 24 hours a day this time of year, so I was expecting a call back on Saturday 2/28 (you can verify this by going to their support web site < http://www.hrblock.com/customer_support/self_serv/contact_options.html >.
 As for the call back - they missed it - it's now Tuesday 3/3 and over 120 hours and I have not received a call back. This lack of response is not surprising - they are not known for good support (lots of reviews on the web where people are not satisfied with their support).

It allows no edit other than zeroing everything out.  Trying to enter fresh charities with new donations is also frustrating because Block insists on shoehorning your answers into their preconceived notions and also into too small space.

I am willing to chalk that up to my unfamiliarity wtith their software.  However I am now working on my MD state taxes and finding their MD state program is downright primitive.  With Turbo Tax, state tax preparation is almost automatic, a few  clicks and you're done; not so with the Block program.  For example,  I am filing a joint return and despite having already determined taxable income for each person for the Federal return, Bloch requires you to re-enter that information again manually when figuring the additional MD deduction for spouses each having an income.  Turbo tax software has not done that for years.  Based on my continued difficulties I have lowered my rating evaluation to one Star.",H&R Block tax program leaves a lot to be desired.

NY, however, acted 100% according to my prediction; the accountant's calculation result indicated I was eligible for approx $1,000 return from NYC but instead they stole approx $370; a classic move of the most rotten city in the world.

If you're not good at boring documentation, forget this or TT and just go to your tax professional.  It saves time, frustrations and concerns.  Trying to save mere $50 or so by using a software like this is not worth it.",Rocket science if you moved from a state to another in the working year

I'm not understanding how H&R Block can be an approved software by New York State for New York State corporate tax returns when the software doesn't work for efiling -- yet the New York state law requires that all business returns must be efiled.  How can this be possible?

My dad left the family a decedent's trust that requires the filing of a form 1041 while my mom is alive.

There is a drop box in the federal return so that you can designate this as an inheritance and I was given a $3000 deduction plus a carry forward loss for future years.  All fine so far.  But when I did my South Carolina return, there is no way to designate this as inherited property.  In South Carolina, you can't take a loss on property from another state, and I understood that logic; but the question process led the South Carolina return to treat the entire loss as INCOME, $140K rather than $3K.  Had this been commercial property, or not inherited, that would have been correct  The loss from the federal return to count as income should have been $3000, not the $140,000 total loss.

I completed TurboTax and found that I was to get $990 back which was much more in line with last year's return. This was the correct amount because I compared it with last year's return and double checked the numbers five times to be sure. The down side of TurboTax is that they are constantly trying to push extra services and charges on you. I guess the old saying of ""you get what you pay for"" is correct.  Also, I received an email from H&R Block saying that if I proved I bought TurboTax last year they would give me a free copy of their program this year to try free of charge.

5226,1,H&R Block,34.6,"04 3, 2016","I am writing a quick review for any procrastinators considering buying this software. I actually bought two copies, as I live in New York and work in New Jersey, and must pay taxes in both. It's considerably cheaper to buy a second copy to download the second state than to purchase it within the program, but I digress. I bought H&R Block software this year because of Amazon's refund bonus deal, which is no longer available from TurboTax. However, owing more money with H&R Block more than makes up for any advantage.
The bottom line is that H&R Block added close to $20,000 in additional wage income not reported on my one and only W-2, without any explanation. There is an explanation link which brings up a help topic as to why the wage income reported may be different, but none of them make any sense. My non-wage income isn't anywhere close to equaling the discrepancy, and it is accounted for elsewhere. The only possible explanation is that H&R Block is disallowing nearly my entire 401k. What I suspect is happening is that the software is having trouble dealing with the same income being reported in two different states, but this is a common issue in the NYC area. Unfortunately, H&R Block's internal help is less than useless and their website support doesn't handle this sort of problem at all. I attempted to initiate a chat session, and ended up waiting for more than an hour without a response, only to find I'd been logged off the site.
I ended up purchasing TurboTax instead and not only did it report my income correctly, but my Federal tax bill alone was $5,000 less than with H&R Block. My NY and NJ taxes were similarly reduced. The money spent on H&R Block software was a complete waste.
One more thing - H&R Block Deluxe cannot handle more than one form 8243 and instructs the user to fill out the additional forms manually. I have never run into this problem before, even with older versions of Kiplinger TaxCut. Not only that, but the built-in item valuations are significantly lower than those in TurboTax. In addition to the other problems I experienced, H&R Block tax software is not the best option for those with non-cash charitable contributions.",Phantom Income added - owed $5k more in Federal taxes alone than with TurboTax

When I opened my return, it showed $0 refund and efile status said it had not been filed. Turns out the update deleted all the data in my return but the file had the same name as the one I submitted.
Phone support person could confirm that my federal efile was accepted but because I had not saved my work as pdf or another format, there is apparently no way to recover my work.

I finally had to move all of the tax info from my desktop to my laptop to solve the problem so that I could file my return. That was a big hassle that needs to be solved by H&R Block working with the major internet security software companies, and providing explicit information to solve firewall problems as a part of the software help menu.

2I called about another problem that has occurred for a second straight year. Specifically, HR Block rather aggressively touts its H&R Block Refund Bonus offer for refunds to be issued as an Amazon electronic gift cards. However, choosing the Amazon e-card option blocked allocating part of my refund to purchase US Treasury Series Savings Bonds, and using the Form 8888 to buy the I-bonds blocked the Amazon electronic gift card purchase.

I tried multiple times for nearly an hour to accomplish the dual refund allocation, but each time, the software thwarted my attempt. When I called the HR Block Helpline about the above I-bond-Amazon card conflict, the young lady did the best she could to be helpful, but she did not have the technical software information needed to solve the problem. Finally, to get the filing completed, I cancelled the Amazon e-card allocation and went with all of the refund going to just the I-bond option and a bank account.

For 2016, H&R Block needs to add a VERY explicit software menu step that makes it completely user friendly to allocate a refund to all three options of the e-cards, the US bonds, and a bank deposit (with the understanding that the Form 8888 will appear for the bond purchase after one has made the initial refund allocation choice via a user friendly menu).

Everything looked right - their estimate box in the upper left of the screen showed what I usually get each year (my income etc. hasn't changed much).

Problem 1: When I then entered a small amount of interest I had earned from a CD, my refund was suddenly cut roughly in half.  I knew this could not be right, so I decided to start over.  I created a new file and entered my W-2.  Again, everything looked fine.

Problem 2: I decided to save my work at that point and restart, just to see what would happen.  When I left the program after saving the file, everything looked fine.  When I reopened my file, my refund had again been suddenly cut roughly in half.

I decided to go all the way through to the end, hoping perhaps at some point it would correct itself.  It never did and continued to provide inaccurate information.  I of course did not actually submit my info to the IRS from their program since I knew it was wrong.  Much as I hated to pay more money, I decided to download TurboTax after all and compare.  Sure enough, it gave the correct amount all the way through, and I just filed my taxes for the right amount.

I do not like bashing companies, and I have no affiliation with TurboTax or any of H&R Block's competitors.  I am very computer savvy and am running a modern Windows machine.  The only conclusion I could come to is that H&R Block's software has a flaw in it somewhere.

5264,1,H&R Block,34.6,"02 13, 2016","I have used H&B Block's Deluxe software for years with no problem.  I am suspicious that there is a problem with this specific software sold by Amazon.  First of all, this 2015 software would not calculate the American Opportunity Credit correctly.  I had to manually do my calculations on IRS Form 8863 and manipulate the software so that the numbers would show up correctly on my tax forms.  Next, when I tried to take the standard deduction for my state and local sales taxes it gave me the option to choose the higher amount but it did not change my refund amount.  We should have received a credit for sales taxes paid but the software would not calclate the credit.  Lastly, regarding the Missouri state portion of this software, under the income tax screen for married filing a joint return the software automatically divides last year's refund in half and greys out the section.  It doesn't allow you to to enter your portion of the state refund so that it will calculate your spouse's portion under the ""refund, credits and offsets of state and local taxes"" category.

This has been an aweful experience using this software and I'm sorry I just didn't got into the store and buy it at regular price.  I got this at a special price that Amazon was running at the time and paid less than half of the regular price.  I was a little skeptical about the software when it arrived in an envelope rather than a DVD/CD case.  Bottom line is you get what you pay for.  Now I will either have to file my taxes incorrectly or purchase the software at regular price and do my taxes all over again.

Last night, searched the internet, including Amazon reviews of the error & sure enough, multiple individuals have had this same problem- all indicated one or many problems talking with HR Block customer service, including rudeness, lack of program knowledge and just plain failure to solve the problem. Apparently, more problems stem from filing thru Block rather than with the software's performance itself. Some customers were lucky enough to have Block provide them with a website address to download a non-corrupted version of the program.

5418,1,H&R Block,54.0,"04 30, 2016","I have used this tax software since back when it was ""Kiplinger,"" but I've finally had enough. I'll be trying TurboTax or something else next year. My tax situation is admittedly a bit atypical, but not *that* atypical. I live in one state and have income from both the state I live in and the one next door. So I do a federal and two states each year. The process of doing that did improve slightly this year, but the software continues to be poorly integrated between state and federal... and the state implementations are very stripped down. And buggy. I spent the better part of an hour figuring out what to do about an entry in one of the state returns that the software was flagging as a problem... but it was automatically calculated and there was no way to alter it. I eventually decided that the problem entry was actually in part of a form who's purpose was to determine eligibility for some deduction or other--which I was not eligible for. So it was irrelevant. Ignored it and went forward.
The last straw though was with Federal return. They aren't even doing that right anymore. I owed money, hit the option to set up a payback plan, changed my mind and decided to pay it all via credit card.
Couple weeks later I get a letter from IRS that they have accepted my payback plan. The software is not smart enough to figure out that if you change your mind and pay the tax in full, the payment plan is no longer relevant and that form should be deleted.
If I have to examine every form one by one to make sure the software is doing what it's supposed to... I don't see the point in using it. Unless maybe it was a free Beta or something.
And don't even get me started on the labyrinthian support process. I made a few attempts to get some help and all the filtering steps present options that don't apply. Where is the option to select ""Your software isn't working right!""?  Nowhere. You either have a question about forms and tax rules or about ""how to use"" the software. No option for ""I know how to use it, but it is not working correctly""
So yes, I'm going to bite the bullet and learn an entirely new software I've never used. Maybe TT is a bit more focused on doing one thing right? HRB is certainly anything but focused on delivering a smooth, clear, well-supported software experience.

Update: a few weeks later, I now know that the software also failed to send all the required electronic forms from state 1 to state 2. So state 2 is now asking for a bunch of paperwork via mail -- the entire return from state 1, w2 and some other form. So add that to the pile of reasons I hope to never ever use this product again.","After more than a decade, it's goodbye and no thanks for the memories."

After my interview, it was ready to e-file my taxes: but first, there was an ""accuracy check"". It found 19 ""errors"" on the Federal return. The State return was fine, but it would not send it. Luckily, 15 ""errors"" were just the program's misapprehension that I overpaid for medical care. I work in healthcare law, saw their misunderstanding, and moved the program forward.

The other ""errors"" came from 4 separate areas of the return. Why didn't these come up the first time I addressed the areas, during the interview? A couple ""corrections"" required me to complete new forms, with no explanation or help. It finally emailed my returns. The next day, it showed my State return was rejected, but provided no explanation.

I opened a ""chat"" session to get answers, big mistake. For the next couple hours, I watched the screen tabulate my status, advancing in a line of 200-something customers waiting online for help. Finally, their rep came on. He lacked both a grasp of English, and of how to find answers. He had me wait, but after 35+ minutes, I was relieved when the screen said it ""lost"" the chat connection..

(Our return has the usual Schedules B and D for investments, a pair of Schedule C's, and various supporting forms, nothing too far out of the ordinary.) This year, TaxAct revised their product offerings into four tiers and removed Schedule C from all but the most expensive tier, so I went with H&R Block Deluxe as a cheaper alternative. Wow, was I disappointed. These were the three biggest problems I encountered:

1. The software repeatedly entered incorrect values on line 13 of form 8889, the Health Savings Account (HSA) deduction. Line 13 says to enter the smaller of line 2 or line 12. For some reason I can't attach a screen capture to this review. It shows line 2 is 3300, line 12 is 3325, yet this software entered 3350 for line 13. I had to override this value to continue, which would have made e-filing impossible.

2. When the interview reached form 8962, the health insurance Premium Tax Credit (PTC), the program threw me directly into the form with no assistance. With millions of people now buying health insurance through a federal or state marketplace, this is a very commonly used form. There was one FAQ for this form: ""How do I complete this form if the program isn't calculating this for me?"" Answer: ""Visit [...] and read the instructions for form 8962 to determine what to enter."" Gee, thanks! If you're self-employed, be sure to check out pages 50 to 67 of Pub. 974 to see how much fun it is to do these calculations by hand.

3. While comparing my completed return to last year's, I realized that in 2014 I had a foreign tax credit carried forward to 2015. At no point in the interview did the program ask me about that. This would be entered on line 10 of form 1116, ""Carryback or carryover (attach detailed computation)."" Last year, TaxAct filled in this line and created a two page supporting document to meet the ""attach detailed computation"" requirement. In H&R Block, this line was blank, and although I could manually enter a number here, there was no provision for creating a supporting document.

This wasn't a preliminary version of the software, either -- I was using version 7401, which was up-to-date as of 3/28/2016. I reported the incorrect calculation to H&R Block tech support level 1, who got me in touch with level 2 support a few days later, who offered to escalate me to level 3... I declined and asked for a refund.

Since I no longer trusted this program, I started over with TaxAct Premium, which handled the above three forms correctly. For the record, I have no affiliation with TaxAct and am still displeased by their price increase. However, a less expensive program is no bargain if it costs this much time and frustration.",Unacceptable errors and omissions

UPDATE (3/28/2015): I bought Turbotax and let me tell you this if you have a K-1 statement: it was a nightmare to enter the details in H&R Block but was a breeze in Turbotax! In H&R block, the guide (if they call it guide) to enter K-1 entries is very confusing. This is my first K-1 (and I had no idea I was getting one; it's the result of stock trading) and I was worried that I messed it up in H&R Block. But in Turbotax, the guide was very clear and in-line with the contents of the K-1. Much easier!

I found a bug in their Indiana state module that causes the amount of return to be incorrectly high.  What's worse, it's actually not possible to correct it without going into the tax forms during the accuracy review and overriding the incorrect entry.  So, even if I wanted to pay $20 to e-file this state, I can't anymore.  I called their support line and alerted them of the bug, gave them a reproduction and explained to them how to fix it.  I told them that I wanted my money back under their ""Maximum Return Guarantee"" and they said they had to escalate to a manager to dispense it.  I'm looking forward to seeing whether their ""guarantee"" is for real or just a bunch of hot air.

However, after using this year's 2015 version to prepare my taxes I have quickly become very unsatisfied.  The 2015 software is full of bugs and can be described as ""clunky"", at best.  Throughout my preparation process the software lagged and often made significant and extreme changes to the estimated return amount with virtually no entry changes.  The worst problem I experienced was when I was ready to upload my e-files (Federal, two state) to the IRS the program would crash within 30-60 seconds of submission.  The software was originally downloaded on a Windows Vista OS.  I even redownloaded the software and uploaded my saved tax file to a laptop with a Windows 10 OS.  Same result.  I have reached out to customer service twice by phone.  Their customer service is HORRENDOUS.  Today I spent 1 hour and 45 minutes on the phone with a customer service representative.  Not only was he not able to come close to resolving my issue, he could not even offer me one single alternative to how I could upload my filings to the IRS.  Instead, I was offered a $19.99 refund for my second state return purchase.  Absolutely unacceptable when the product I purchased does not function.  The CSR was dismissive, unconcerned and only apologetic when I finally lost my patience and began to get angry for being no further along after being on the phone for nearly two hours.  Currently, I have no other option to electronically file my taxes other than to print/mail, file online (for additional fees), see a tax specialist in person, or start completely over with another tax software.

I should have trusted my instincts.  I decided to take a chance this year, and try their ""buy an amazon gift card with part of your refund and get a 10% bonus"" offer.  So far I've spent 4 hours on hold over the course of three days getting the run around.  The first day I was told someone would call me back within 24 hours.  Nobody called me.  So i called back and I was told that the ""callback time"" wasn't 24 hours, it was 48 hours, so someone would call me back within the next 24 hours.  Of course nobody called me.  So I called again, and was told that it's not 48 hours, it's 72 hours, so someone should call me within the next 24 hours. I wasn't willing to accept that (again) and told the rep that I wanted to talk to whoever was supposed to call me back.  I was told 3 times they didn't have a way to contact that person, but after I insisted I would not get off the phone until I talked to him, suddenly they could.

Edit: the company did eventually make good on their offer, and I did eventually get the money back that I put into it along with the bonus that was initially offered.

The very next thing I did was enter a $6 (six) dollar interest income amount from a savings account. When I did, my refund dropped by $1200. I thought, ""Wow, six lousy bucks put me into a totally different tax bracket that would increase my taxes that much?!?!?!"" So, I went on to my deductions. I own a home and pay interest on my mortgage and also pay property taxes. I also give substantially to our church and other non-profits. When I entered all of those in, my refund didn't budge. It was still $1200 less than what it was before I entered the $6 interest income, so I deleted that entry. It still didn't change. At this point, I don't trust this software AT ALL. So, I go to TurboTax.com and enter all of my information exactly as I did with H&R Block. When I entered my W-2, I got the original refund number that I did initially with H&R Block. When I entered my $6 interest, my refund didn't change or reduce at all. When I entered my deductions for my mortgage interest, property tax, and charitable giving my refund increased another $700. So, that totals $1900 difference from H&R Block and Turbo Tax.

I understand that this is just February 1 and an update is on the way, but I don't trust this software and won't be purchasing it again in the future. If the next update fixes this issue, I will maybe change my rating to a 2 or 3, but either way. I am going back to Turbo Tax next year, and will probably purchase it for this year too.

5570,1,H&R Block,54.0,"01 17, 2016","I am reviewing my experiences in April of 2015, so that you may understand the quality of the software and support.

 H&Rs software stopped working correctly due to a program update during April of 2015.  Two entries with significant tax consequences were incorrectly changed to ""yes"" and could not be changed to no.  Additionally, the PA state S-Corp income that I had previously entered completely disappeared when opening the state portion of the software.  $0 was shown for PA S Corp income and it was not possible to enter any amount for PA S Corp income.

The first H&R tech I spoke with was either not willing or not able to understand the problem, and told me to call the PA Dept. of Revenue for assistance.  Upon calling a second support tech, after 3 hours on the phone during which time the support tech attempted to deflect responsibility for the problems, the second tech finally verified the software problems by having me walk him through operating the software.  He stated that he would escalate the problems and I would receive a phone call from technical support.
I then received two more lengthy calls from tech support which required me to again explain the problems and walk them through the software to demonstrate the existence of the problems.  At the close of both calls I was told that the problems were as escalated and that I would receive a follow up call the following day.  Having received no follow up call during the following day, I called to follow up.  The tech again required me to explain and prove the problems.  I was then told that the problem would be escalated and that I should call back if I do not ""hear from them"" within 5 days.

After 4 days I received an email to call H&R Block tech support concerning the problems.  Upon calling, I was told that no problems exist with the software.  After reminding her that the program worked properly prior to receiving their software update and that H&R Block software engineers previously verified the problems, the tech asked me why I did not file my taxes at the time that the software worked properly.  The tech then again stated that there was no problem and that H&R Block would take no action.

As much as I hate Intuit/TurboTax as a company, their product is much better than H&R Block.  You cannot download data from brokers with H&R block. [Update 3: It's hidden and labeled in a cryptic manner - in the income section go to the 1099-B section and it's the ""Import Assets"" link, I had to wait 40 minutes on chat to find this out]  Can you imagine this?  What year are we living in?  I have to enter each trade manually.  Also, since I have a couple of state tax refunds from overpayment that was amended, H&R block, instead of walking me through the steps to properly put this down as you might expect, they told me to look up IRS form 525 on my own and figure out what amount I should put down myself.  Why am I even paying for H&R Block if I have to figure out IRS forms on my own?  Plus I can't even download data from banks/brokers.  As much as I hate TurboTax, I'm considering cutting my losses and downloading TurboTax to finish my 2015 return.

Update 1: finally got someone on the phone and they uninstalled and deleted all the hidden folders related to TaxCut or H&R Block, reinstalled, and now it works fine.  You may want to try that if you run into runtime errors.  Creating a 2nd user account on Win10 did work but is not ideal.  It took about 1 hr 15 mins to reach someone on the phone.  Haven't actually done a return yet but will update if I run into issues.

Original review:
I installed on a Win10 machine and the first time it ran fine, then when I tried to open it the second time, it gave me a runtime error.  (Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library)  I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling about 10 times to no avail, I've ran it in compatibility mode per tech support to no avail.  1st tier tech support sent me to their escalation team and I've on hold for over an hour waiting for someone to help me.  If it takes over an hour to reach support, good luck in April.  Their chat support has been available with no wait but they can't seem to help me with this issue.

Seems like from searching online, you can get around the runtime error by creating a  new user on Windows 10 and using the software from the other account.  I have not tried this since I don't even know if it'll work and I do not want to create a new user if I can avoid it but it seems like that may be my only option or try to get a refund and go to a competitor...","Can't download data from brokers, must enter each trade manually.

The bug is in the AMT exemptions worksheet: If line 28 is over a certain threshold and the worksheet needs to be used to determine by how much the exemption needs to be reduced, the program skips the worksheet and comes out with no reduction in exemptions. As a result, it vastly overstates the refund. I have done a comparison calculation in another program, and the H&R program is definitely wrong here. If I would file such an erroneous return, it would surely be rejected or subject me to an audit. Doing the math correctly is the essence of a tax program, and this one cannot be trusted! Like many others I had switched from Turbo Tax to H&R last year, and last year it worked fine, no AMT bug. But this year I'll need to switch back to Turbo Tax. I need a correct tax return, after all.

Update on 03/10/2016: It looks H&R has fixed this bug now. I downloaded the software upgrade, and my return immediately changed from a refund of $6000 to owing $4000! A look at the AMT forms shows that the calculations are now correct. And the return now matches to what Turbo Tax calculated. It is good that H&R resolved this egregious problem. But there was no notification or announcement. There is no list of problems they fixed with each upgrade on H&R's website. I happened to have found the problem on my own because I was suspicious that my return was so different than those of previous years. But imagine you didn't know and got surprised that your return changed by $10,000 just by downloading an update. Or worse yet, what would you do if you already filed the return, got your $10,000 refund by error and spent it. No, I don't trust this program anymore. I'm keeping Turbo Tax (which of course had the correct math all along), and I'm keeping 1 star in my review for H&R.",Major math error - useless

Using this software, I completed and e-filed my Federal and State of California tax returns during the morning of January 22, 2016. I promptly received an email from H&R Block notifying me that my returns had been successfully transmitted to the IRS. In the email, it indicated that e-filed returns are normally accepted by the IRS within a few hours of submission. I was able to validate this information with my own research. It is my further understanding that it should take no more than 48 hours for the IRS to formally receive my refund.

It's now January 28th and my return has still not been received/accepted by the IRS. I have contacted H&R Block multiple times in an attempt to resolve the issue. They continue to refer me to the IRS. I have contacted the IRS as instructed -- they still have no record of my return. Looking on H&R Block's ""Community"" message boards, I found dozens of users experiencing this same issue. Apparently, H&R Block's software is NOT transmitting our returns to the IRS. Today, I finally managed to get my case ""escalated"" with H&R Block's customer support team. I will report back here whether this actually resolves this issue.

I gave up when I honestly had no idea where I was in my filing process and found myself entering my income information in forms that I knew were incorrect based on previous filings, but not because this program helped me out in any way. In one case I had to locate and fill out form 2555 and after I had struggled through that, I got to the last screen that told me to go and manually enter the information I just filled out into the correct lines on the 1040. Why in the world can't the program prefill that? Furthermore, which line am I supposed to put it on? Seriously guys, this is basic, basic stuff. I pretty much spent equal times on irs.gov as I did in this program looking up information (like country codes for Pete's sake) which should simply be native to this program.

5670,1,H&R Block,60.5,"04 21, 2016","This is the last year I will use this software.  We have a simple, straightforward return that includes modest income from wages and a rental property with a small loss. The Federal portion of the program works adequately, but the California state program is useless.  Every year I have to clunk through manually completing worksheets for CA form 3801.  There are no instructions or an interview.  The FTB's instructions are cumbersome but manageable.  I worked as a tax preparer for several years during college and I have a degree in Accounting.  I don't use it, but I haven't lost it.  This isn't my first bar-b-que.

After getting all the numbers to line up right in the software a few years back, I just follow the old form and all the numbers line up in the right place year after year.  The amounts entered are transferred to Schedule CA and the return is done.  Except this year my return was rejected by the state.  This year we had no taxable state refund for federal purposes, so no adjustments were made on Schedule CA.  Consequently, the software doesn't include the form (Schedule CA) when filing.  I won't even go into the nightmare that filling out the 3801 form worksheets is just an exercise.  It's a huge frustration because all of the information needed to fill out the form is found in the program.  Even if there were other adjustments, the software (this is why I buy it) should be able to ask the relevant questions and fill out the form for me.

This is where the software broke completely for me.  Because Schedule CA has no adjustments in our case, it's not considered needed for the return and isn't included.  Except - form 3801 - remember this form? the one you have to painstakingly fill out manually? - this form triggers the need for Schedule CA because somewhere in the electronic filing process, the State checks to see if the numbers on 3801 match the numbers on Schedule CA.  No Schedule CA?  Oh.....  REJECT.

According to customer support, there is no way to override the software and force the missing schedule CA to be included.  I could go back to the federal return, itemise deductions instead of taking the more favorable (for us) standard deduction, then the adjustment for taxable state refunds would cause Schedule CA to be included.  It also increases my tax liability, but even if i chose to pay the price to get the return off my desk, the federal return is already accepted and you know what?  I SHOULDN'T have to do that.

This software cannot accurately complete my tax return.  It doesn't know what forms are needed.  It doesn't do what it claims it can do.  I have a simple return with no obscure forms, no weird tax situations, and I take the standard deduction!

I picked up H&R Block this year to do my personal taxes and will never purchase this software again.  The interview process the software uses is confusing and could easily lead someone who is not a tax professional to enter incorrect information, or even lose out on deductions and credits.

To give an honest review, I decided to use the interview process to the end to see how the software would do, instead of doing what I would normally and direct enter into the necessary forms.  While I had to think about what the software wanted several times, I finally completed my taxes and then went back to review the entries that were made.  The following are the errors:

(1)  The software did not ask for me to enter additional dependents for form 2441 (Child and Dependent Care Expenses).  The IRS code section allows for dependent children who had no expenses to be entered at an expense of zero dollars.  This changes the ratio for the dependent children who did have expenses and gives the taxpayer a bigger credit.  If you know this, you can enter the additional dependent through the review form, but you are not prompted to do so, even though your total dependents have already been entered.

(2)  The software completely missed asking information for AMT purposes in regards to prior period unallowed passive activity losses.  To correct this there isn't even an interview question.  You have to know the amount and go to the forms view, find the line item and enter it yourself.  Otherwise it incorrectly computes AMT. In my case this was a little over $7,000 error.

I thought I was all done in early February and tried to e-file, when it told me I couldn't.  One number was supposed to be equal to another but it wasn't.  I checked and there was a formula that added my AGI to a bunch of other boxes (*that were all zero*) and came up with a different number- their formula was AGI + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 - 0 = AGI+1.  After spending hours and days on the phone with their ""tech support"" - most of whom only read the same questions that I got from the software""- they finally said that I should just override the number manually.  Except that means you can't e-file.  OK, they said, just override it and print it out.  Turns out the software wouldn't even let me override the wrong number.  So I was hosed.

I have used the competing software to file taxes for years and decided to give H&R a chance as the competing software had gotten too big for its britches. And H&R was priced half of that.

The problems started when I tried to use it. The W2 imported well enough, but then the questions got complicated. I couldn't figure out whether to answer yes or no to a lot of them so I answered yes, saw what happened, then answered no and tried it again. When I tried to do something slightly more complex, I kind of got the feeling I was being double taxed for the same transactions. At that point this software lost my trust. If I cant be sure the calculations are right, then there's no point using it any further.

5709,1,H&R Block,60.5,"02 19, 2016","(I posted this originally for the CD-ROM version of the program but am also posting it here as it applies to the downloaded version as well)

My experience with the software started out well enough - the program installed and started up easily and began with the usual questions of name, SSN, contents of the various boxes of the W2, etc. As time went on, however, it became apparent that the product was slapped together hastily and rushed out the door so as to start making money for the manufacturer as quickly as possible. How else to explain this screen I came across?

""Special Case Applies for 1040, Line 10. Your tax situation is a special case. To figure the amount for Form 1040, line 10 see the recoveries section of IRS Publication 525: Taxable and Nontaxable Income. Tell us the amount you figured for line 10.""

The whole purpose of buying the software is to keep me from having to read IRS publications and figure out what to put in the various lines and boxes... the software is supposed to tell me that! Even worse, my ""special case"" was not all that special - I had a state income tax refund last year and also paid AMT last year. At any rate, I dutifully read Publication 525 and, after about an hour, figured out what was supposed to go into line 10; something that turned out to be easily programmable if the manufacturers could be troubled to do so.

I continued onward and later was flummoxed by the question, ""Is Rent Amount for this Rentals and Royalties Worksheet? [Yes/No]"" I still, to this day, don't know what was actually meant by this question - I ended up having to figure out the answer by putting ""Yes"" and seeing what the program did with the tax forms and then by putting ""No"" and seeing what that did. To the best of my knowledge (after another hour or two of study), ""No"" proved to be the correct answer but I am sure the IRS will set me straight if I've gotten it wrong... many years ago I had gone to an H&R Block brick and mortar establishment and had them fill out my taxes. A couple of months later, I got a very politely written letter from the IRS explaining that I had figured my taxes incorrectly and sent them too much money. To save me some time, they were just going to assume that I redid my taxes according to what they figured for me and they just went ahead and sent me a check for the amount that I overpaid.

Anyway, I pressed onward through the program, answering questions such as ""Tell us on which copy of your worksheet you want to report your rents"" via trial and error (0 resulted in an error but the program seemed happy with 1) until I got to the end and filed the taxes electronically.

Incidentally, electronically filing with the IRS is free but electronically filing with a state costs $19.95 extra...

After I filed, I reviewed the forms that were printed out for my records only to discover (even with my rudimentary tax knowledge) that the program had entered double the proper number for the rents that I had collected. Turns out that the program had asked me for the rents I'd collected twice but the second time it was asking me for ADDITIONAL rents collected that I had not told it about on the first screen. Naively, I entered the same figure on both screens when I was supposed to enter the proper figure on the first screen and zero on the second screen. The mistake ended up resulting in me being charged about $7000 additional tax so naturally a refile was in order.

Unfortunately, the IRS does not accept electronic refiles and H&R has apparently never tested the refile portion of their program on live humans beings so the refiling ended up being even more arduous than the original filing. I think I've got the proper forms printed out now but, again, I'm sure the nice folks at the IRS will let me know if I haven't got it all straight.

At any rate, I won't be using this product for the next tax season; instead I'll go with something less painful such as sawing at my wrists with a rusted razor blade in hopes that I bleed to death prior to April 15th.",This product hates you and wants you to suffer!

The only possibility to correct was to create a new return (a long process on a complex return). I did and the program made the same error with the MAGI.

Upon installing the software, it would not activate.  This is the SAME glitch I experienced last year.  It kept giving me a bad SSL connection error or that my computer date was incorrect.  My computer date IS correct - it is set automatically and I verified it was right.  I looked through the H&R Block forums and others have had this same issue.  I changed the proxy settings to automatic.  Rebooted and restarted the program.  Nadda.  Same result.  At this point, I uninstalled the program and went back to TaxAct, which is what I wound up doing last year.  (I even tried installing it on another computer - same result with it too.)

You have to call them and stay on hold forever, or ask questions through their forum, which may or may not be answered.  I finally got through on the phone and requested a refund.

So the $19.95 charge was posted SIX TIMES. Only one charge cleared, but the other five charges are still pending in my account and I am told by my bank that because H&R block didn't cancel them that my funds will blocked until Monday - a full week later.

Historically, the software was decent, got the job done, and saved me a few bucks (vs turbo tax) in the process. This year, the software is buggy - my issue in particular was with the the screen that actively calculates your refund as you make progress throughout the interview. After entering my W2 information, it said I owed one number and then on the next (without inputting any new information) it said I owed something like 3-4x the number on the previous screen. This ended up being a MASSIVE WASTE OF TIME. I felt that the new higher number was inaccurate so I started all over from scratch - yet the same issue occurred. I decided to continue the process all the way to the end and the number (again, without adding anything new) returned to the original amount.

In addition to the standard complaints (installation problems, absolutely abysmal customer service, etc.), I'd like to add that it doesn't appear to do the calculations correctly for 1099-DIV or Home Mortgage Deductions.  For example, I entered a 1099-DIV as a test, and for this test I stated that all of the dividends were qualified. For these dividends, H&R Block calculated a tax rate of 22% even though my income comes nowhere close to the 20% tax rate for dividends.  At most it should have been 15%.

Admittedly, this apparent discrepancy may be due to my misunderstanding.  However, I spent literally hours in the H&R Block Software Help and on the website trying to understand the forms and the calculations, but both resources were incredibly unhelpful, as was the chat.  The H&R Block Software is essentially a black box, and all you can do is hope that the numbers coming out are accurate.  I'm undecided as to whether I will purchase another tax software program or do my taxes by hand this year, but I definitely will not be using H&R Block.  What a waste of time and money.

Update: So I did get TurboTax and entered the same numbers I entered in H&R Block.  However, my refund with TurboTax is nearly $4k greater than with H&R Block.  Obviously, this is a significant discrepancy, and I'll be going with TurboTax's calculations - not because it works in my favor, but because the calculations are consistent with tax law (e.g., 15% for qualified dividends instead of 22%).

I have used H&R Block since 2002, but never again. Unfortunately, now that I have zero confidence in H&R Block, I'll have to go through the past few years' returns, verify they are correct, and likely submit amended returns.

The first time I tried completing and submitted my returns the software said that my federal return was rejected because my ""AGI"" was inaccurate (didn't match) even though I used H&R block software the previous year and this information should have been automatically imported. I had to call the IRS's automated system to get a PIN to file.  I did so and the fed return was accepted.  The state return, however, remained in a ""rejected"" status.  The first time I called customer support I got disconnected while they were assisting me.  The second time that I contacted customer support they told me that I had to completely re-prepare the return all over again.  I did so but when I got to the end the software said that I had already completed and filed my return.  I then went to check status of return and it read ""rejected.""  The third time I tried yet again to completely re-prepare my state return.  I prepared it and then got to a screen for my state return that made STATEMENTS (not asking a question) regarding out-of-state taxes (I neither owe or paid any) but only allowed me to choose ""yes"" or ""no"" buttons to proceed.  Since H&R's online customer assistance reps are clueless and keep instructing me to completely re-prepare over and over again, this time I just hit the ""no"" button.  I then proceeded to the end where once again the software claims that my return was already completed and filed although no charge for e-filing appears with my credit card  company.

5780,1,H&R Block,60.5,"02 14, 2016","The Business product is garbage. I gave it a chance because I'm sick of Intuit constantly raising prices and stripping features out of TurboTax. Boy, did I regret it. The software is little more than a series of fill-in forms; there's very little value add to the raw IRS forms. You have to read the IRS instructions to figure out what to do with anything.

If the program were just the forms, it would actually be better, because there are numerous problems with the forms and prompts. For example, in the NY State Business return, the prompts refer to 2011 and 2012 while the form reads 2013 and 2014. It won't E-file the return because of conflicting errors, for example, it says ""Error: When filing form 1065 the following supporting forms are not allowed: 8453-PE"" and immediately below that, ""Error: Signed and scanned form 8453-PE is required to be attached as a pdf document""

I called their support number to try to fix the problem. After holding for 30 minutes, the person I talked to had no idea about how to fix it and was clearly unfamiliar with the product, directing me to click on menus and buttons that didn't exist. He said he would escalate and that I'd get a call within 48 hours. 48 hours later, no call.

So now, I gave up and decided to just file with paper. I go to print my return, and a jumble of pages comes out. There are a bunch of pages at the beginning that are for your information, like the dubious Error Report with the above nonsensical errors.

How else to explain this screen I came across?

""Special Case Applies for 1040, Line 10.  Your tax situation is a special case.  To figure the amount for Form 1040, line 10 see the recoveries section of IRS Publication 525: Taxable and Nontaxable Income.  Tell us the amount you figured for line 10.""

The whole purpose of buying the software is to keep me from having to read IRS publications and figure out what to put in the various lines and boxes... the software is supposed to tell me that!  Even worse, my ""special case"" was not all that special - I had a state income tax refund last year and also paid AMT last year.  At any rate, I dutifully read Publication 525 and, after about an hour, figured out what was supposed to go into line 10; something that turned out to be easily programmable if the manufacturers could be troubled to do so.

I continued onward and later was flummoxed by the question, ""Is Rent Amount for this Rentals and Royalties Worksheet? [Yes/No]""  I still, to this day, don't know what was actually meant by this question - I ended up having to figure out the answer by putting ""Yes"" and seeing what the program did with the tax forms and then by putting ""No"" and seeing what that did.  To the best of my knowledge (after another hour or two of study), ""No"" proved to be the correct answer but I am sure the IRS will set me straight if I've gotten it wrong... many years ago I had gone to an H&R Block brick and mortar establishment and had them fill out my taxes.  A couple of months later, I got a very politely written letter from the IRS explaining that I had figured my taxes incorrectly and sent them too much money.  To save me some time, they were just going to assume that I redid my taxes according to what they figured for me and they just went ahead and sent me a check for the amount that I overpaid.

Anyway, I pressed onward through the program, answering questions such as ""Tell us on which copy of your worksheet you want to report your rents"" via trial and error (0 resulted in an error but the program seemed happy with 1) until I got to the end and filed the taxes electronically.

Incidentally, electronically filing with the IRS is free but electronically filing with a state costs $19.95 extra...

After I filed, I reviewed the forms that were printed out for my records only to discover (even with my rudimentary tax knowledge) that the program had entered double the proper number for the rents that I had collected.  Turns out that the program had asked me for the rents I'd collected twice but the second time it was asking me for ADDITIONAL rents collected that I had not told it about on the first screen.  Naively, I entered the same figure on both screens when I was supposed to enter the proper figure on the first screen and zero on the second screen.  The mistake ended up resulting in me being charged about $7000 additional tax so naturally a refile was in order.

Unfortunately, the IRS does not accept electronic refiles and H&R has apparently never tested the refile portion of their program on live humans beings so the refiling ended up being even more arduous than the original filing.  I think I've got the proper forms printed out now but, again, I'm sure the nice folks at the IRS will let me know if I haven't got it all straight.

At any rate, I won't be using this product for the next tax season; instead I'll go with something less painful such as sawing at my wrists with a rusted razor blade in hopes that I bleed to death prior to April 15th.",Accomplished the seemingly impossible - made filing taxes EVEN MORE painful!

You're supposed to get gift cards totaling your IRS refund (or however much of your refund you specify) plus 10 percent.  So, for example, if you sign up to devote $1000 of your refund to the bonus program, they are supposed to give you $1100 in gift cards.

The catch is that if the IRS reduces your refund for any reason, they reduce your gift cards by the amount of the reduction.  If the reduction is greater than the amount of gift cards you signed up for, then you get nothing.  That's True even if you still have plenty of refund remaining to cover the gift cards.

The business program is needed for fiduciary returns (1041) and is the opposite of the Premium program.  Does not seem like they put much work into it.  You click next, it says, open form, enter the data directly on the form, close form, click next and do the next data.  No explanations, nothing. All it does is have you put the numbers directly on the form.  Do I need an expensive program for that? I tried calling and after getting through the automated assistant I got a message saying not to hang up after talking to the agent for a survey.  Then the agent came on, I asked the question as it was not explained, and was put on hold.  30 minutes later I got the survey.  The guy did not know the answer and hung up on me.  I tried it again the next day, and the same thing happened.  The people sound like they dragged them off the street, can hardly speak English, and certainly do not know anything.
  So, I got on the internet and downloaded the actual IRS instruction sheet.  Too bad that the programmers of this program did not do that because there are many differences/mistakes between the two.  And since the completed form needs to get sent to the IRS, then I would expect that their instruction sheet is the one to follow.  I actually presented one of my questions to a tax attorney and he said ""The software is wrong""

5825,1,H&R Block,42.99,"02 23, 2016","This was the first year that I tried to use an H&R Block program for my complicated business tax return. I had been using TurboTax Business quite successfully for the past several years to prepare and submit the tax returns of my multi-member LLC, e-filing the federal return while printing and mailing the state document. But my state switched to an e-file requirement that TT initially could not fulfill for TY2015, so I decided to try the cheaper H&R Block Premium & Business, which did have that e-file capability according to my state tax department. Most important for me in deciding to make the switch, HRB stated right on the cover of the CD package that the Premium & Business program was for Small Business Owners and that it Imports from TurboTax. So I fully expected the HRB Business program to import all of the detailed information on our company from the previous year's TT return -- including the complex depreciation history of our physical assets, each with its own amortization schedule involving different calculations and tables from year to year. Re-entering all the company information and data manually would have been a very time-consuming and unwelcome chore and could have introduced any number of errors.

Regrettably, the joke was on me. Once I managed to successfully install the HRB Business program on my Windows 7 PC (after a few failed attempts), I repeatedly tried to import the data from my TY2014 TurboTax Business return, without success. An SOS phone call to HRB customer support then confirmed my worst suspicions -- it was not possible to do so despite the Imports from TurboTax claim on the CD package. The representative suggested that this statement referred only to the Premium program for personal taxes, not to the Business program. So the label stated a half-truth, at best, which in my case was worse than no truth at all. Silly me, for believing what I read.

Fortunately, I checked back later the same day with my state tax department and learned that TurboTax Business had finally added e-file capability for my states pass-through tax returns. Many thanks, TT -- it took you quite a while, but better late than never. In quick succession I uninstalled the cheap but inadequate HRB program, returned the CD package to Amazon for a full refund, downloaded the pricey but now fully capable&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TurboTax-Business-2015-Federal-Fed-Efile-Tax-Preparation-Software-PC-Download/dp/B01637RDP8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TurboTax Business 2015 Federal + Fed Efile Tax Preparation Software - PC Download</a>&nbsp;program, installed it without a problem, effortlessly imported all the data and information from my 2014 TT file, easily completed my federal and state returns, and successfully e-filed them.

He also stated ""this form will not be available this year and may be considered for future years.""

Since there is no way for me to do my taxes in the software AND include this form, the product is virtually useless to me this year.

1. Send a check

3. Pay with credit card

I'm thinking why not pay with a credit card, I could always use the travel points! So I submit my tax form and AFTER it is finalized and approved by the IRS, H&R Block software sends me to some website to pay by credit card. I fill in all of the info and on the very last line I see they want to charge me a 2.29% convenience fee, with my tax bill, this turns out to be $100!! I'm thinking screw this, I'll just fill in my routing and checking number and have them do a direct withdrawal, nope, can't do it because everything is now finalized with the IRS!

For example I was unable to enter a 1099 (business income) in the schedule c, I had to enter it in another part of the return.

The recapture goes in the same box but with a different code. At this point I called Block's customer support.

I tried the tax expert chat and it gave their hours of operation, which started a few minutes later.  I started trying to connect at the appropriate time but it just kept giving me their hours for the first ten minutes. Finally I was connected and was 13th in line.  I waited more than half an hour to connect to a tax professional.

I explained the situation to hime and he advised me that there was no reason the tax credit item would stop me from efiling.  He said it was an error in the program and instructed me to upload the return to their tech support.  He then transferred me that department.  After another long wait I was connected to a tech support agent named Chetina C.  She had me try deleting the form and reentering the information.  When that didn't work, she told me the following:
Chetina C.: well due to those entries you will not be able to efile due to the forms
Chetina C.: Due to the entries you will not be able to efile it is not a technical or program issue it is due to different forms being filed
I told her that her company's tax professional had advised me that the entry should not stop me from efiling and got this response:
Chetina C.: tax expert may have thought that it was under regular education expenses

So apparently tech support understands tax forms better than the tax experts.  At this point I told her I wanted a refund. I had downloaded the product earlier the same day.  I was advised to send a copy of my receipt to their office and wait 4 to 6 weeks for my refund.  The receipt cannot be faxed or uploaded but must be sent to them in the mail. No apologies.

I downloaded Turbo Tax and it flew through the return, asked me the appropriate questions in the interview and entered the recapture.  No problem at all with efiling.  I am done with H&R Block.",Sub par product.  Terrible support.

In my case I was going to use H&R block to file the state return from which I anticipated a refund and fill out the forms and mail them in for the other state, but the software makes no allowances to just give you what was paid for and deal with the remainder on your own.

So the only way I can file Form 1040A, which I prefer for reasons that are not relevant to this review, is to print it and file the paper form.

Bad choice. Yes, most of my information was imported. The problem was in the editing. Every time I edited data, the program created a different page for it -- so instead of editing the original imported entry, it was creating a ""copy"" of it. I found this when I got to the end of each section and was running the review -- and every time I ran the review at the end of the program (because I was labeled an audit risk -- see below), it created ANOTHER copy. I had no fewer than three copies of the vehicle I use for business (although they were all the same vehicle), three copies of my at-home office expenses, etc. Then I discovered the program had ""imported"" data that weren't even in my 2012 return. When I got to the royalties page to enter income from a book, I discovered that H&R thinks I'm a landlord. I'm not -- but there was an entry there anyway, called my ""2nd"" source of royalty. No idea where that came from. Worse, however, when I finally deleted all those multiple pages and told the program I'm most definitely not a landlord, I found that I'm at a ""moderate"" risk for an audit. And the reason? H&R says it's one of the following:
1) my total income is more than $200,000 (it isn't -- not even close);
2) my income is less than $25,000 and I'm claiming the ETIC (it isn't and I'm not);
3) I'm claiming more than 40% in alimony costs (I'm not paying alimony to anyone);
4) my income is $30,000 or less, but I'm claiming 20% or more in unreimbursed business expenses (it isn't and I'm not);  or
5) I have business income over $200,000 and I'm claiming self-employed health insurance greater than 40% of that income (I don't and I'm not).

This year  I had rental income and expenses to report for the first time (damn you airbnb). the listing indicated I need Premium for that.  I read reviews below which indicated that this software does not stand up to the challenge of rental property. But I assumed it was just about property sale. So I went ahead and downloaded it, anyway. Sure enough, the software does not help with the rental income. Form 1099-K is not even listed. I did get to the H&R Block support which comes free with this software. I got a technical suport, not a tax specialist. He did have to do some research and told me that I need to file schedule E. Since that does not pop up automatically during interview, I need to do it manually afterwards. Not sure yet where I report rental expenses, his research did not find that. I will have to figure it out myself, and/or ask for a tax specialist chat, which is also included with this software.

My tax situation was very easy except for 3 issues:
1. I had to pay tax due in 2002 for my 2001 State Tax Return
2. I collected foreign dividends, interest and captital gains
3. I payed foreign taxes (on those foreign dividends and

  to enter this information, so that it would properly carry

  question.

  process and had my enter the amount right away.
2. Neither program provides any support for dealing with foreign
  currencies, so you're on your own with the conversion.
3. Form 1116 was another nightmare with TaxCut, which basically
  left you to filling out the forms / worksheets by yourself.
  TurboTax made it much more easier.
Other issues:
- Changes in the Federal Data did not always carry over
  properly to the State Return (i.e. when I deleted info
  about Estimated Taxes payed). I only noticed this
  when comparing the figures with TurboTax
- I bought the ""Platinum"" version, but I didn't see any
  practical benefit.

figures, however TurboTax' interview progress was much clearer
and mad me much more comfortable.

I figured TaxCut would be the same as TurboTax or maybe a little better since I never loved TurboTax. However, I found it to be worse. First the good points, it did import my dad from Quicken and last years return fairly well. Now the bad:
1. It had an annoying inconsistency in entering dates. Sometimes it insisted you use 2-digits etc. I think software should be smart enough to figure out the different ways people enter dates, rather than force people enter dates one way.
2. The platinum upgrade is worthless. I got it for the ""capital gains assisteant"" but that turned out to be nothing more than having you enter you information on multiple screens (interveiew style) rather than one. If you go with TaxCut save the 10 bucks and go with the deluxe or standard editions.
3. It did some to know how to handle my Employee Stock Purchase Plan. It did not ask me about the discount I bought the stock at (which is taxed differently I believe than the capital gains). Since I sold at a loss this did not worry me.
4. It had me enter information many times when it seemed like it should have been smarter. I think I enter my address 4 times - why can't the program figure out that I am not moving?

3. Form 1116 was another nightmare with TaxCut, which basically
  left you to filling out the forms / worksheets by yourself.
  TurboTax made it much more easier.
Other issues:
- Changes in the Federal Data did not always carry over
  properly to the State Return (i.e. when I deleted info
  about Estimated Taxes payed). I only noticed this
  when comparing the figures with TurboTax
- I bought the ""Platinum"" version, but I didn't see any
  practical benefit.
At the end of the day both programs calculated the same
figures, however TurboTax' interview progress was much clearer
and mad me much more comfortable.

25404,2,H&amp;R Block,35.5,"03 11, 2003","I made the switch from TurboTax to TaxCut because of Intuit's copy-protection schemes that treat me like a criminal and make we worry about not having access to my return in the future. I figured TaxCut would be the same as TurboTax or maybe a little better since I never loved TurboTax. However, I found it to be worse. First the good points, it did import my dad from Quicken and last years return fairly well. Now the bad:
1. It had an annoying inconsistency in entering dates. Sometimes it insisted you use 2-digits etc. I think software should be smart enough to figure out the different ways people enter dates, rather than force people enter dates one way.
2. The platinum upgrade is worthless. I got it for the ""capital gains assisteant"" but that turned out to be nothing more than having you enter you information on multiple screens (interveiew style) rather than one. If you go with TaxCut save the 10 bucks and go with the deluxe or standard editions.
3. It did some to know how to handle my Employee Stock Purchase Plan. It did not ask me about the discount I bought the stock at (which is taxed differently I believe than the capital gains). Since I sold at a loss this did not worry me.
4. It had me enter information many times when it seemed like it should have been smarter. I think I enter my address 4 times - why can't the program figure out that I am not moving?

This software only includes the IRS instructions and many links to call a tax advisor for explanations.  The second problem is the user interface.  It was NOT TESTED.  There were screens in which the text wasn't completely clear (covered by other text and not scrollable).

Tax Cut is clumsy and buggy compared to my earlier experiences with TurboTax.  I'm not going to go through a blow-by-blow of the problems with this program, but suffice to say that I think it is a hard to use program which makes the pain of tax time worse, not better.  Back to TurboTax for me!",My Third Year Using TaxCut ... and it still is very clumsy
25427,2,H&amp;R Block,27.3333333333333,"04 9, 2005","This is the last time I will use TaxCut. I bought TaxCut last year because TurboTax cost $10 more and had a lot of bells and whistles I didn't need. I didn't really have any problems with TaxCut last year. This year was a whole different story. It is harder to edit than TurboTax which isn't always easy.  I could have done my Federal and State returns manually in far less time.

Initially I wanted to import the data from last year's TaxCut but somehow the file was missing and so was my backup copy. So I tried to import the data from 2002 TurboTax which TaxCut would not do. It had to be a 2003 return. That meant I had to reinvent the wheel and manually reenter all the information which was one reason I use a computer program for, to avoid that tedious repetition.

The first real problem I ran into was when I ran the Final Review, it came up with an error message which prevented me from E-filing and the error message was vague giving no clues as to how to correct it. It involved an itemized deduction which did not make sense because I hadn't itemized deductions. But in looking at the forms list of My Forms, a list of the forms that I had supposedly completed, there was a Schedule A. When I examined the Schedule A I found it had entries for property taxes, charitable contributions, and deductible interest. Where these items came from I don't know because they didn't come from me. Then I tried to delete the Schedule A but I couldn't until I deleted the charitable contributions worksheets. It took me some time to figure that out. Once I did that I was told I could file a 1040A form.

Then I did the California State taxes which went smoothly until I tried to enter the estimated taxes I had paid to the State. There was no place under the State Interview to do that and if those payments were not entered I was faced with paying a penalty. I went to a live chat with TaxCut and was told they had to be entered on the Federal forms which I did and that corrected the problem. However, now I had a Schedule A with the Federal form and could not file a 1040A.

Printing completed forms was wasteful. Many pages had no information on them. I wanted to print only the pages that had information on them and I want to duplex print them but when I hit the Print button it gave me no choices. It printed out every thing on one side of the paper.

My biggest gripe however, was with the E-filing. I have an EFTPS service with the IRS which allows me just to type in my EFTPS Number which allows the IRS to deduct any payments from my bank. But TaxCut is not set up for this and makes the user go through a tedious process of entering and re-entering all the bank information not only on the Federal Return but also on the State return.

Worst of all, TaxCut has the gall to charge for E-filing when both the IRS and the State do not. Earlier this year both TaxCut and TurboTax announced that they would no longer charge for E-filing but apparently that was phony.

Lastly, when I wanted to calculate my estimated taxes, the process was tedious. TaxCut does not assume that your income will virtually the same and requires that the user fill in all the blanks instead of posting the figures and then allowing the user to change them if needed. And there was no interview in the State program for estimated taxes. I had a lot of trouble finding out how to do it and then when I printed out the forms, it printed one small quarterly form on a sheet rather than putting them all on one sheet of paper. No wonder we cut down so many trees.",Bad mistake

Looks like I have to switch back.  TurboTax is not perfect, but it looks like it does better than TaxCut.  TurboTax claims that they can import TaxCut data.  We'll see.","Forgot to ask me about property taxes, doesn't do amendments"

Textboxes overlap labels, text is not formatted to fit on the form, controls are not aligned, and on and on. It appears this was a high school project for introduction to programming. While the input forms are laughable, somehow, the results have been correct and the IRS accepted the filing. TurboTax is obviously done by professional programmers but often has technical problems. The amazing thing is that these big companies cannot create a decent tax program after many years of trying. I think if either of these companies started listening to customers, they would learn a great deal and might produce a much better product.

But this year, our return was rejected after e-filing because the IRS says ""Incorrect Spouse AGI"" for the electronic signature.  We contacted TaxCut via online chat.  We were told ""Well, this is caused by a processing error with your Electronic Signature. What you will need to do is e-file your return without using the Electronic Signature"" evne though we bought the software so we would be able to do a paperless filing and be done with it.  After a halfway-cross-country move and in the process of renovating a house, we didn't want the hassle!

We asked the online support person very specifically if this was a problem with TaxCut or the IRS.  His response was ""As I said, it passed the H&R Block e-file servers, but it was rejected whwn it reached the IRS servers.""  That was it.  No other response from him.  We're going to have to print and sign a paper form and send it out.

Not the end of the world, certainly.  But considering we bought the software to avoid the extra steps -- specifically to do an electronic filing without worrying about paperwork?  Not really helpful.  We have since found out that this ""Spouse AGI"" thing was an issue in the 2002 edition of TaxCut as well.

First, Tax Cut isn't as thorough (e.g. doesn't prompt me to fill out form 8283 for Noncash Charitable Contributions even though I need to) or helpful (we live in state with no income tax so the calculation for sales tax is advantageous - they don't have a link to the IRS website to the tables that I need to use).

More importantly, when I ran the final review, there are four errors that require software updates in order to be resolved.  After several failed attempts to update, I went to their website, searched for a fix and, finding none, used the chat feature for support.  The guy told me to download the update directly from their website (why they didn't have that anywhere on their FAQs or problem listings, I don't know), and contact them if I continue to have problems.  Surprise - when I tried to install the update, I received an error message telling me that I don't have Tax Cut installed on this computer.  So I'm back online with the chat folks hoping for a resolution.

Let's hope this goes better than my problems with DeductionPro (see my dismal review of that software for more info).  In that case, I wound up returning it for the Turbo Tax version (Its Deductible - which worked perfectly).  I may wind up ditching Tax Cut for Turbo Tax and starting over.

In addition, TaxCut for State (Illinois) was suppose to be available for download 1/28. It is now the 2nd of February and I am still waiting. I tried talking to two separate people via their live Help on their website, but neither of them knew when the update or the state would be released.

But I ran into some very annoying problems with TaxCut.  1) I had lots of stocks to enter last year and TaxCut screwed up after entering about 10 stocks.  I had to redo and reenter those that it messed up (and this was repeatable as I had two returns that I had to enter that many stocks). 2) printing was poorly supported and printed returns showed page creep (one page runs just over one page and after about 10 pages it's really off and the print only has half a page with the other half on started on the next page).  I filed electronically but print a copy for my records and that copy is less than desirable.  3) TaxCut didn't support the Mac OS X *standard* ""Save to PDF"".  4) tech support wasn't helpful on the printing issue or the stock data entry stuff.

I'm switching back to TurboTax this year (and doubt I'd switch again in the future).  I was pretty happy with TurboTax (on the PC) but thought I'd try TaxCut since it was a little cheaper and I hadn't used TurboTax on Mac OS X in the past (so either would have been the first time on the Mac).

I don't do anything wrong (pirate, illegal copies) with the software anyway so what's the difference?  Anyway, I miss TurboTax.  Taxcut is not very helpful in guiding me through complex forms (itemized deductions, proporty tax stuff).  In fact, I could not get any interview guidance with writing off my home office until I went in and manually began filling out the form.  After that is when I could use the interview process.
The help in Taxcut is very primitive.  When I got stuck within a form and clicked on the help button, it took me to the page, ""Getting help with Taxcut"".  Not useful at all.

I wanted to be certain that I wouldn't face hassles down the road if I needed to reference an old return from a different computer or hard drive, and I wasn't assured that TurboTax would provide that.  Nor did I want TurboTax's additional spyware installed on my machine.
So, I installed TaxCut, and the installation and product update went fairly well.  It easily and correctly imported data from my old TurboTax return.  It did slap an annoying EarthLink icon on my desktop, even after I declined their ""offer.""  After working on my return for several minutes, the program quit with a C++ runtime error--without saving my return to that point.  So, I opened it up again, set the autosave for a smaller increment, and continued.  I was glad I did that, because it shut down twice more.
That's plenty irritating, but in addition, I found that the program was not as thorough as TurboTax.  There were a few times where my answer to a question was a ""special case"" and it referred me to an IRS form, without any further assistance.  This occurred a couple times on the state form as well--the program basically said, ""Find the tax form instructions and read them; we have no idea how someone would qualify for these credits.""

Unfortunately, I will have to go back to TurboTax next year as TaxCut is very substandard.
I have a moderately complex tax return (including a Schedule C business) and have a fairly firm understanding of the tax codes that pertain to me, which was a good thing, as the interview is NOT complete in several important areas, and presumes that you know how some specifics apply to you. This was especially True in business deductions, and the dreadful Schedule D interrogation. I had one issue on a broker statement that was never addressed in the interview, nor was any help available on how the program wanted it entered (it was a 'cash in lieu' transaction). I checked the help pages and indexes, but it had no idea. I finally had to essentially do my Schedule D by hand and make sure the numbers were correct, as the only way to enter it was as a dividend (which it technically was not.) I have never had problems like this with TurboTax. I am grateful that I had no foreign taxes paid this year; I don't think I would have had the patience for that.
Another problem I had was with the entries for the form 8606 ('Nondeductible IRAs') which couldn't figure my basis from my 2002 return plus my 2003 contributions. The verbiage used to ask the questions in the IRA interview BEGS you to make an error in entering the basis. When I used the 'show form' function, unlike TurboTax, it will not show the IRS form, it shows the IRS form plus a lot of TaxCut worksheet entries intermingled with the real form which is extremely annoying, when all you really want to do is look at the real form to see what the program is doing for certain entries.
The interface itself is laughable. It takes up about the middle half of my monitor, and there is no way to maximize it. Why on earth TaxCut would ignore huge bands of space on the sides of the presentation and make the font small and hard to decipher in a central window is a mystery to me. Beware of the interview. If you have anything other than an extremely simple return, it is inadequate, and you will need help (I recommend the J. K. Lasser ""Your Income Tax 2004"" book) figuring out how to enter some data.
My overall biggest complaint, though, without doubt, was the error check at the end of the program. After I finished entering my data, it said I had nine errors that had to be corrected, and ten warnings, that I should examine. In all cases the 'errors' were due to things TaxCut did not do correctly. For instance, it imported my 2002 TurboTax results and saw I filed Schedule C-EZ, but this year I needed a regular Schedule C. TaxCut was not smart enough to delete the C-EZ, and in fact came up with a paragraph long explanation of where I needed to look for entries pertinent to the C-EZ and manually delete them or change them to refer to the new Schedule C, and only then could I delete the Schedule C-EZ (which was, at any rate, empty.) The other 'errors' were because TaxCut doesn't grasp what 401K contributions do to your W-2. I wrestled with fixing these errors for about two days. Ugh.
I can't recommend this product. I gave it two stars only for the simple reason that after all was said and done, it did compute the taxes correctly, and the state taxes were actually a snap.

25489,2,H&R Block,40.5,"02 7, 2005","This software disappointed on several straightforward tasks:

1. The Employee Stock Option interview is terrible: it performs NO actual calculations. It gives some vague advise about how to handle Stock Options and Employee Stock Purchase Plan situations rather than directly calculating the tax impact. I had to refer to the guides given to me by the broker, AND the TURBOX TAX website to figure out how to calculate the cost basis for these situations. The software, especially software labeled PREMIUM, should have this functionality built in and I should not require a trip to a competitor's website and the use of a hand calculator! That's why I buy tax software. TurboTax actually performs calculations when you input data.

2. The download ""feature"" for W-2, 1099, and 1098 forms is humerous. I have used this feature in TurboxTax for my W-2 form from a major Fortune 500 company and the 1099-DIV form from the Vanguard Group. Apparently, Taxcut has no agreement with these major corporations--the list of supported employers, brokers, and mortgage companies is tiny.

3. Printing-there seems to be some formatting issues with the worksheets when printed out. It seems to print outside the printable area of a standard printer.

On the plus side, the software is relatively cheap and is probably OK for simple tax situations. Its laid out logically and imported my 2003 tax data from TurboTax competently. But I would purchase TurboTax if you have a more ""complex"" tax situation (although I hardly classify Employee Stock Options and Purchase Plans as complex in 2004).

25495,2,H&R Block,90.99,"04 9, 2006","I used TaxCut for this first time this year (2005 tax year). I had been using TurboTax for several years, but I got upset about the way TurboTax pricing and features kept moving up the product line. I had to spend more money every year for the same functionality. Well, it turns out that TurboTax is worth the extra bucks. It is a much better quality product and worth the extra cash.

My problems with TaxCut are:

- Limited online help. Their help wasn't useful at all.

- Kept asking me to type in values from my 2004 tax return even though the program had imported my old files. The program shouldn't ask me for values it had read in off the disk.

- Did not correctly handle stock options. My employer added the proceeds to my W-2, but there was no way to indicate this in the software.

- Online chat and person-to-person phoen support is weak. The folks I interfaced with didn't have a clue how to help me with the stock options stuff.

- T2 technical support, the next-level after the folks who answer the phones, does not work weekends - not even the last weekend before tax deadline! They told me, ""You'll have to call back on Monday.""

I went to the store yesterday and bought TurboTax premium. The change was refreshing. It took me under an hour to manually transfer the TaxCut numbers into TurboTax. The interview questions were better and the stock option support was right on. Plus their deduction finder actually reminded me of some things I had forgotten.

25496,2,H&R Block,90.99,"04 6, 2006","My experience is consistent with some of those above and with those posting on the Deluxe product as well: the product has a lot of simple bugs, poor instructions, and unhelpful customer service.  Here are some of the problems I noticed:

1) many things are not covered by the interview - they ask you to open up the form and enter everything yourself

2) the online update gives misleading messages (customer service said there would be a California update, but the Update tool said there were ""none planned"").  Also, it's now April, and the Update tool is still saying that a Federal update will be available ""in February"" and that I should check back then!

3) There seems to be no way to take a foreign tax deduction instead of a credit.  The interview mentions that both are allowed, but in practice if you have foreign taxes listed on a 1099, it requires you to file a foreign tax credit form (it fails in the error check if you don't).

4) Worst of all, when I went to e-file today the IRS rejected the form, due to missing entries on two forms: 8801 (credit for prior year AMT) and 8606 (for a Roth IRA conversion).  These are not lines that I'm supposed to fill in - they are simple calculations that should be done automatically by the software, and in fact the boxes are grayed out to indicate that, but nothing was put there and the TaxCut error check passed.  The message from TaxCut tells you that you have to manually override them to put the correct values in, and that you cannot e-file as a result!

As an engineer and a programmer, it seems like a poor job was done on the software and it hasn't been tested nearly enough.  When you email the support center you get responses that suggest the person responding hasn't really read your message, and is simply cutting and pasting from something on their screen (which is OK, but the responses weren't relevant).  The chats are a little better.

I just got back from buying a copy of TurboTax Premier, which is a lot more expensive but I'm sure it will work.  I'll never make this mistake again.

25497,2,H&R Block,90.99,"03 4, 2006","I purchased this software as a result of a favorable review in the New York Times. I wanted help figuring out how to deal with exercising stock options. I did learn some valuable things (that I didn't know before) about what I can deduct.

However, I have several issues, starting with the most serious. When I went to electronically sign the form prior to e-filing it, the instructions said that the IRS will not accept the e-filing unless you enter your previous year's adjusted gross income exactly. Last year I didn't round on my tax form, and the TaxCut software does, so there was no way I could enter last year's adjusted gross income exactly. I decided to try to e-file anyway, hoping the rounded version is close enough.

Prior to filing, I printed the form and reviewed it carefully --and it's a good thing I did, because after I filed, I could not view my form again. I can see a report of what I entered, but when I try to view the finished form using the software, I get a message box asking me if I want to save the existing form -- every time. The finished form is nowhere to be seen -- and cannot be accessed by either of the methods the Help says to use to view your finished return.

I clicked Customer Service (which took me to H&R Block's Web site). I tried to create an e-mail using the Customer Service form, but when I chose the TaxCut option button so my question could be directed to the right people, I couldn't enter my name, address, or telephone number -- only my e-mail address. When I tried clicking Next, it took me back to the starting page -- every time.

I won't know until tomorrow about the status of my e-filing. I can't see my return, so I have no idea whether an actual return was filed, even though I was charged $15.95.

I eventually found a support telephone number, which I intend to call in the morning.

Oh, and one more thing, it really irks me that only my husband, the taxpayer whose name appears first on the return, is listed on the schedules. Apparently I, the ""spouse"" and the person who actually does our taxes every year, am not significant enough to have my name included too.

Update: The next morning I called TaxCut Customer Support. Both times I spoke with a support representative, they talked as if they were going to help me, but I was mysteriously ""cut off"" and left with a dial tone. The second support representative took my callback number, but didn't call me back. It seems they were unable to give me a definitive answer to my two most important questions (whether their rounding conflicts with my previous year's return and would prevent the IRS from accepting it and how to retrieve the previously saved document).

Bottom line: This product shows promise, but its designers need to think more about customer scenarios and test the functionality more carefully. It's almost as if they shipped a beta. And their customer ""sevice"" is sadly deficient.",Software design and support have serious flaws

25501,2,H&R Block,90.99,"04 12, 2006","First I will talk about the bug, then I will relate my tech support experience.

On the New Jersey Non-Resident form there is a bug on line 14 where there is Column A, for your income everywhere, and Column B for your NJ income. According to the instructions for this form that are provided by the state, if all of your income was in NJ, you put the NJ income from your W-2 in Column A - NOT THE FEDERAL AMOUNT. (I called the NJ Tax office and was told the same thing.) The software puts in the Federal Amount which is less than the NJ amount therefore calculating your taxes wrong. There is a way to override it and put in the correct number. You have to go to one of the drop down menus on top and find the ""forms"". Click on that, then open the form you are working on. Go to the line/box you want to override then right click and click override then put in the right number. BUT, beware, if you put in the wrong number the guarantee that H&R Block has if your taxes are calculated wrong will be null and void. If you make a change and are eligible for credit for these taxes in your home state, make sure to then put the correct number in the other states form as well.

Also, one minor bug in the NY state form. I live in Kings County. It actually prints King County on the form.

As for technical support, I first tried the online chat. It seemed at first that the problem was clear to the person helping me. After 15 minutes of waiting he came back and said it was right. I told him what the instructions said and he responded by telling me he was not a tax advisor. I reiterated that it was a bug and not a tax issue. He went to ""research"" it again and came back with some nonsense about efiling. I said it had nothing to do with that. Unfortunately I accidentally closed the window as he started to tell me about the guarantee. So, I called the next day to speak with someone. She told me I had to start a new form separately from my other forms. I tried this but I would only let me put my income in as other income, thereby bypassing all the necessary calculations and write off sections on the form. So, I called again. This person started off with saying he is not a tax advisor, but I got him to actually do some work. He used some numbers and went through the process step by step. Finally the lightbulb went off and he saw the problem. He disappeared for about 5 minutes then came back saying that there was nothing he could do to help since he is not a programmer. He offered to transfer me to a supervisor which he did. The supervisor told me he would report the bug and that no more fixes would be out this year. He then told me how to override the amount, but informed me of the issue with the guarantee being invalidated.

Other than these problems it was smooth, but I am somewhat concerned that there are other problems I did not catch. Good Luck.",NJ 1040 NR Bug

25504,2,H&R Block,94.6533333333333,"04 3, 2006","I have never written a review for anything online before, but the flaws in this program are so enormous, I feel obligated to inform others. Here are the ones I've discovered, in no particular order:

1) There is absolutely no easy way to transfer just your returns as one file to view or print from another computer. You cannot save your returns as a PDF file or anything else that can be opened without the TaxCut software. Which means that if you are using TaxCut on a computer that is not hooked up to a printer or the internet, there is no way to file your returns without huge difficulty (as in installing a new printer, transferring the entire TaxCut program to another computer, or something else equally tedious and time-consuming). This is just an idiotic flaw that really shouldn't exist in any software at this point.

2) They don't advertise that it costs a lot to e-file your returns. A lot of programs offer free federal filing. Not TaxCut. It costs $16 PER RETURN. Adding that costs with the costs of the program and state programs, you might as well go with a real accountant.

3) There are lots of state returns that cannot be filed electronically. This isn't necessarily a TaxCut only problem, but I found out personally that you can't file part-year resident or non-resident returns electronically. Now, this really becomes a TaxCut problem referring to point #1 when I realized there's no easy way to print and file paper returns either.

4) Customer service is hit or miss. Because of issues 1-3, I've had some exposure to TaxCut technical support. The first time I called, it was about issue #1, saving returns as a PDF. That was in mid-March, so I'm sure they had been hearing complaints about that for a while now. But the person I talked to had no idea and had to put me on hold for 5-10 minutes so that she could ask her supervisor and then inform me that there was nothing I could do. The last time I called I got a much more informed person who admitted to me that they've had a lot of complaints about the PDF issue.

The only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is that it's probably a serviceable program if you have a simple federal return and one state return that are all able to be e-filed. But taxes aren't always that predictable and if you buy a software package, it should be able to handle some of the things that can come up.

Semi-complicated tax situations such as when I got married and had to file tax returns in multiple states proved to be too much for TaxCut in the past.

This year, I had to say that I found a couple of features quite nice.  On the other hand, I found several bugs that were quite annoying.

This year, H&R Block cut out many of the rebates.  Deduction Pro was included in the deluxe edition, rather than having to purchase it separately and send in a rebate.  Even better, the state programs are included on the CD!!  There is no need to purchase it online, download it, and send in another rebate.

Now for the bad:  This year, I used the software to do a ""Married filing separately"" return.  The federal portion worked quite well.  However, I did have the following issues.

1. Despite a spouse's age being significant in some tax calculations, the program never asked the birth date of the spouse.  Because of this, I had to override the programs input on several forms.

2. I used the program to calculate a ""Medical Care Insurance"" adjustment on the state return.  TaxCut told me to get the state instructions, perform the calculation, and put the answer in the blank.  I found this quite annoying as I did not have a copy of the state instructions handy and the calculation was quite simple.  I'm not sure why this wasn't programmed better.

3. I skipped over a charitable contribution entry during the federal interview as I did not have the information handy at the time.  I intended on going back and adding it later.  I added the information later and I had no problems on the federal taxes.  However, the state taxes were unable to deal with the changes on the federal return and I was forced to make the changes manually during the state ""error check"".

4. My state requires submitting a copy of my federal return with my state return, but TaxCut did not print an extra federal return when I printed off my state documents.

Here are the major problems with TaxCut Delux as compared to TurboTax Delux that I used last year:

1. The TaxCut automatic update function is broken and keeps returning error code 23. The only way to get the latest fixes is to download the full 9+MB file from their Web site.

2. If you have mutual fund or brokerage investments, TaxCut Delux does NOT allow for electornic downloading over the Internet of 1099 information form the financial institutions.

3. It never occurred to TaxCut that a mutual fund reporting tax exempt interest could possibly have capital gains. It does not allow one to enter capital gains from the 1099-DIV form after you checked that the dividends are tax exempt.

I had to boot up into safe mode again this year to install TaxCut. However, I was able to run TaxCut from normal boot, so a little improvement.

Once installed TaxCut imported my TurboTax file and everything seemed to work smoothly. As TurboTax did last year. I'm not sure what these companies are doing with their software builds as the Tax software are the only programs I have installation problems with.

TaxCut's only advantage is that it is cheaper. If you take out price from the equation, TaxCut is inferior in quality.

- In 2005 TaxCut software there was not PDF output of all the forms. This was pretty silly because after couple of years if I want to access my tax return I am not going to install TaxCut again in my computer and view by return. I would rather have have my tax return available in some widely acceptable format like PDF and then access/distribute whenever I want (I don't keep my documents in hardcopies). So I wrote to H&R Block. This year they added that saving return in PDF file feature available. But unfortunately, this is far from being perfect. It excludes number of important forms - example, IRS form 8853, California Adjustment Schedule 540CA etc. Instead of that it saves numbers of useless worksheet (without any data entered in those worksheets), same form multiple times.

- Most annoying thing about this software is updating incorrect data. In one form I entered wrong data. While reviewing it I found a problem and went to that specific section to update. But in calculation TaxCut still showed old incorrect number. I just could not make it to use new corrected number. Eventually I had to restart a new return from scratch - just to have an dollar amount corrected.

The program showed no problems with either my Federal or State Income Tax Returns. When it came time to submit my returns for electronic submission to the IRS and the California FTB, however, I got an error message. A form that is not in my return had inappropriate information. Specifically, it showed that I had a Dependant under the age of 18 (no such child) with investment income (no investments, sadly). The state program took exception to the fact that the nonexistant child's name and Social Security number were both the same as mine. The error was vaguely surreal. My attempts to identify the source of and remedies for this problem were met with an incomprehensible help system. A call to the customer service center in India resulted in a suggestion that I wait to submit my taxes until after the next update which might fix the problem. The update did fix the problem, but it was a major hassle for a fairly simple return.

Also,  when I received the Taxcut email that the IRS had accepted my return I logged on to Taxcut to check status and get my declaration control number.  Taxcut would not recognize that I had efiled and would not check for the dcn.

This is my own experience and this may be the last year I use TaxCut because of it. First of all, it would not allow me to e-file my state return but didn't explain why. I later discovered that for most states you apparently can't e-file a partial year return. Then when printing out the state return it told me I had to also include a form that was mentioned nowhere else in the program. I later found out that Taxcut does not support all state tax forms! I then had to get that form and fill it in manually, and then discovered I owed less than before because Taxcut had incorrectly calculated my capital gains. AND there was nothing on the missing state form that could not have been completed with data the program already had.

TaxCut also advised me I could save $1000 off my fed bill by contributing to an IRA. So I opened and IRA and contributed $4000. When I went back to TaxCut and entered the details it told me I wasn't eligible for any tax deduction. I was ready to be tied up! This software is seriously dysfunctional.

I'm guessing by this stage you get the idea. Bottom line: I will be looking elsewhere to complete my tax returns next year.

25540,2,H&R Block,65.99,"01 16, 2007","Perhaps its the latest fashion of out sourcing. Over the years I've watched TaxCut degrade in engineering quality.

Issues:

1) Mac version only runs with ""administrator"" privilidges. This is just typically Microsoft mentality dumb. Unlike Windows, the Mac OS can seperate out limited privilige users (safety mechanism to protect against malicious programs from accessing system areas). An application does not have to have access to system files, to execute on Mac OS, unless the ""inexpensive"" alternative engineer who wrote it, is so profoundly ignorant of his/her trade that they don't know that.

2) Last year, the Windows version would not execute on Virtual PC (Windows emulator, by MicroSoft, for Mac OS). I didn't try the Windows application, on the same CD this year, to see if they fixed that. I'll bet they didn't. The application tried to access a low core address or look for a low core value, and of course, was tripped up by the emulation mode of Virtual PC. (Yet another incredibly naive mistake made by the author.) When I called customer service for a work around, I was told (paraphrasing) ""Tough. We don't support non-Windows platforms"". When I informed this ignorant customer service agent, that my Virtual PC was running Windows XP, his response was the same. Which makes me suspect they planned to execute only on a Intel based CPU, hmmm.

3) Critical updates to the Federal application and my entire CA state application are still not available from H&R. The problem is that the Federal/State dead line for estimated tax payments passed on Jan. 15th. I guess TaxCut is not designed for customers who earn other than wage income. Or at the very least, H&R doesn't care.

4) The application interview process is adequate. But, then I know the tax code and tax tricks in and out. Perhaps, I was able to navigate easier because of personal knowledge.

5) With this pre-real version ""errors"" were generated (not unexpected). We shall see if the application will allow straight forward correction/adjustment of the various worksheets. In previous years, a few of the ""errors"" were uncorrectable, because the application either had no means to access the respective worksheet, or once encoded, data would not change, or once encoded all further adjustments were treated as additions.

6) When I imported my Capital Gains Summary from Quicken, TaxCut garbled the description. It did, this year, correctly translate dates, amounts, & gains/losses. It also recorded, this year, all entries.

Specifically, the TaxCut 2007 installation and update features modify the list of users who can access the \Program Files folder limiting it to only the Administrator who can access this folder. This effectively denies all other users on the XP system access to this folder, which means that ordinary users will have problems executing programs under this folder (which effectively is most installed programs). It also implies that only the Administrator can execute TaxCut.

I was able to fix this issue by looking at another XP system and modifying the access control list (ACL) of the \Program Files folder on the TaxCut system to match the other computer's ACL. Although this restored the system back to normal, TaxCut 2007 still only worked for an administrator, not an ordinary user. I've contacted TaxCut about the \Program Files folder problem.

I've been a user of TaxCut since tax year 2004. The tax part of TaxCut 2007 seems to work OK. I had problems with the installation and update of TaxCut 2007. Specifically, the TaxCut 2007 installation and update features modify the list of users who can access the \Program Files folder limiting it to only the Administrator who can access this folder. This effectively denies all other users on the XP system access to this folder, which means that ordinary users will have problems executing programs under this folder (which effectively is most installed programs). It also implies that only the Administrator can execute TaxCut.

I was able to fix this issue by looking at another XP system and modifying the access control list (ACL) of the \Program Files folder on the TaxCut system to match the other computer's ACL. Although this restored the system back to normal, TaxCut 2007 still only worked for an administrator, not an ordinary user. I've contacted TaxCut about the \Program Files folder problem. They said that they are looking into it.

25616,2,H&R Block,26.99,"03 8, 2009","I used TurboTax Deluxe and TaxCut Premium in parallel on my Mac to do two tax returns, one with rental properties, a side business, and investments.  I won't keep you in suspense: TurboTax is better.  Given the recent Intuit shenanigans with TurboTax limitations and pricing, I really wanted to discover that TaxCut was better.  Alas, that was not to be.

So what's better about TurboTax?  The most significant for me is TurboTax's display of last-year and this-year amount columns in the wages and income summary (you get there with ""select specific topics"" and after you visit each topic), the deductions and credits summary, and in the rental common expenses interviews.  They are the best way to see what I need to do, and what I might have forgotten.  Like those home owner's association dues on one of my properties that I almost forgot.  TaxCut does provide a two-year summary, as does TurboTax.  However I don't find that very useful in either program since it's at a high level.  Also TaxCut shows it as a form, which is an inconvenient way to look at it.

TaxCut also manages to be annoying in how it displays last year's imported data.  There is a single column with blue numbers for last year.  You might think that they would change color or something when you enter this year's data, but no.  TaxCut doesn't even keep track of what I've entered, since it asks me if I replaced the old information, when that's what I just did.  The display and questions are confusing and less than helpful.

The two columns in TurboTax, with ""not visited"" in the this-year column until I do something with it, as well as buttons that say Revisit if I've been there or Start if I haven't, is the right way to do it.  (Though I wish TurboTax would display this year in black and last year in gray, instead of the other way around.)

Another nice thing in TurboTax is that I can have two returns open at the same time and work on them both.  Not so with TaxCut.  TurboTax enables much easier what-ifs between two returns, like who gets which dependents.

Again, TaxCut manages to be annoying even in opening the one return, since it doesn't remember was I was doing.  TaxCut always comes up with the same window, making me pick work on an old return and click on it.  The first time I came back, TaxCut didn't even know what directory I had saved the return in.

TurboTax comes up with the last return I was working on already open, with a button to continue where I left off.  One flaw in TurboTax is that it doesn't remember that I had two returns open -- it only opens that last one I was messing with.

TurboTax always checks for updates when you launch it.  TaxCut requires that you do that manually.  TaxCut might let you know on an interview page if it happens to know that an update is forthcoming.

There were many times that TaxCut had a very short, arbitrary limit on the number of characters in a field, which prevented me from entering what I needed to identify what it was both for the IRS, and for myself next year.  There may be field limits in TurboTax as well, but I never ran into them.

TaxCut also made it very difficult to look at the form relevant to what I am currently working on.  In TurboTax I just hit the forms button in the upper right (and the little feetsies to get back), and I'm there.  In TaxCut, I had to go find the form, if I even knew which form it was, and once there the display was cumbersome.

TurboTax also makes it easy to move between forms and worksheets by double-clicking on numbers that come from another form or worksheet.  You end up at the source for that number.  TaxCut instead asks you if you want to override the number from the unspecified different form.

I won't go into the myriad of little things, like TurboTax accepts 08 for 2008, where TaxCut requires you type 2008, or that TaxCut doesn't use the little red button in the corner and doesn't keep track of whether you've made any changes and need to save, but suffice it to say that in many ways TurboTax was much more pleasant to use.

Some things that are better in TaxCut: the Child EIC and tax credit rules are more clear in the interview process; the Next button mostly stayed in the same place making it easy to review, where in TurboTax the Continue button keeps moving around; TaxCut separates the deductions from the credits, which I like better than TurboTax which munges them together in one page; and of course the biggie, which is that TaxCut never bugs me about upgrading to the next version and sending them another $30 or $40 like TurboTax does *incessantly*.

But the few good things come nowhere near balancing the bad things about TaxCut.  Unfortunately, I have to recommend TurboTax Deluxe over TaxCut Premium.

TaxCut PROs
- Simple.  For former TaxCut users, it's easy to import data - not that fingering it in is that difficult.  I don't use the Flash video help.  Having done enough returns, for me, it's ""just give me the Q&A, please"".
- Nice interview format.
- Handy ""Go to Forms"" if you like to do specific data entry manually. TaxACT renders this faster, but both are good.

TaxCut CONs
- Still doesn't handle non-qual stock options correctly - and doesn't create/report on a Schedule D as it should.
- Didn't handle premature IRA distribution (10% penalty) correctly
My 401k rollover to IRA caused a minor premature distribution ($53) because of timing.  I chose to just cash the check rather than fiddle with my IRA provider trying to get the money back in.  This affects line 59 of the 1040 ""Other Taxes"" but TaxCut didn't report the $53 there where it should have.

WARNING:  Regarding my ""Premature IRA distribution"" check $53.
If you are forced to MANUALLY override a TaxCut value (for me, Line 59 ""Other Taxes"" on the 1040), you CANNOT e-File.  TaxACT gave me $5 less Federal Refund because it CORRECTLY put the $53 on line 59 of the 1040.  Not being able to e-File due to a bug is a major bummer.

Most users with simple returns won't hit these edge cases, though.

=================================
Comparison TaxACT vs TaxCut (in no particular order)
=================================
Overall:  Both keep a running total of State and Federal Refund amounts as you progress through Q&A.  TaxACT is a bit cheaper.  But with tax preparation, for me, it's not always about cost - it's about accuracy.

1.  TaxACT correctly handled my simple, same-day, non-qualified stock options and correctly filled out a Schedule D  (non-qual is probably what most people get @ fortune 2000 companies).  TaxCut failed.
================
NOTE:  With TaxCut,  *this year's* refund comes but maybe 1 year down the road, you're AUDITED due to a missing Schedule D.  This happened one year for me and the IRS insisted I paid NO taxes on my exercise of stock options.  This is ludicrous on it's face because eTrade is FORCED to withhold taxes.  I've reported this bug to TaxCut, am aware of it, and revisit it each year (manually fill out Schedule D).  Why continue to use TaxCut?  It's the devil you know.

================

2. TaxACT lists ""Federal Income tax withheld"" as a line-item on a ""You Credits and Payments"" screen - confusing.  TaxCut more accurately calls this ""Credit Summary"".

3. TaxACT seems a little less refined looking (if you care about esthetics). The fonts are a bit coarser.

4. TaxACT had a separate, more comprehensive screen for ""Life Events"" -  up front - one of which applied to me called ""Premature IRA/401k distributions"".  This was nice to have before going to the Q&A income section of the  ""Federal Q&A"".  TaxCut did not have this item - and TaxCut later bit me and misreported this.

5.  TaxCut seemlessly went to 1099-G (State and Local Income tax refunds) - at a time that makes sense whereas TaxACT goes to investment income while in the Q&A.  A state refund is considered income and when you've got all income items organized, you want all the questions related to income asked in the same section to avoid forgetting to report it (probably #2 reason why returns are rejected).

6. TaxACT has a nice menu-pick feature ""National Average Comparison"" which compares your return with similar returns - gives you a quick sanity check in case you missed something basic.

7.  TaxACT has a specific menu item for ""Compare filing Joint-vs-Separate"".  That's handy in case you revisit the return with your spouse later on and nicer if you're doing another's returns.  TaxCut has this buried in the Q&A.

Summary
Which one did I file?  The TaxCut version.  I filled out the Schedule D manually (as I'd done every year since I found the non-qual stock option bug in TaxCut).

If you have normal interest income (bank CDs) and don't have stock options or other non-standard items on your returns, either one of these products will work fine.

1. Although TaxCut does import data from Quicken and such, it does not import your tax data directly from your financial institution. It is a real pain to input multiple stock sales and the like. I much prefer TurboTax in it's ability to download your data directly from your bank.

2. Like TurboTax, TaxCut does have a main directory with each step listed, however TaxCut doesn't let you know which parts you have completed and which ones you need to visit. I love that feature on TurboTax because I often spread my tax prep over several weeks and input my data as I receive it via mail. I would have liked to see TaxCut include this simple feature.

Unfortunately, after moving through the menus there were areas that were not updated or not available or the software was unable to pull the forms off the IRS website.  For example, the child tax credit form was not available and stated it wasn't expected to be available for another month.  However, at the IRS website, the form has been finalized for a long time.  This problem of incorporating available software was, undoubtedly, a result of trying to be pushed out the door too quickly.

Additionally, very few of the state software/forms will be available for use until at least mid-Feb.  So, while not a problem for the majority of fillers, it is a problem with those of us who tried to accomplish early.

Another problem is that forms that they do have frequently have problems if you want to change an entry.  For example, when i entered the amount contributed to a Roth IRA incorrectly, it would not let me fix until I backed all the way out of the software and started over (for that section). Another software glitch.

25637,2,H&R Block,26.99,"01 15, 2009","I bought TaxCut because at the time TurboTax had a stupid policy of charging an extra $10 for each printed tax return.  They later reversed this, but I had already started preparing a year-end planning pro forma return using TaxCut.  Now that I've used the product, it would have been better to stick with TurboTax even if I had to pay extra to print a planning return.  (And of course, now TurboTax has dropped that stupid charge, so it's no longer a problem.)

TaxCut advantages:  (1) it's a little cheaper, and (2) it has some limited audit protection service built in.  While I don't think it's as good as the extra-cost ($35) audit offering available for TurboTax, but for a relatively simple return it may save you from buying that kind of insurance.  That's it.  In every other way TurboTax is better.

Here are just some of the TaxCut deficiencies:  (1) Interview is MUCH less thorough.  I found numerous areas where TurboTax takes you through detail with explanations while TaxCut just has you fill in a number without a lot of explanation.  (2) One-click relevent help for each entry -- TaxCut often sends you to a generic help page that's not relevent, while TurboTax usually gives you immediate specific details about that particular line.  The TaxCut online help is poor. (3) One-click access to itemized lists.  Both products let you enter a mini-spreadsheet to sum totals for any entry.  But when you go to re-open a list, TurboTax takes you right to the list, while TaxCut just gives you a menu of all the lists in your return, with no hint of which is which other than Form and Line Number.  If you have a form open you can know the form and line number, but if you're in the middle of an interview screen you need to have it all memorized, or else open the lists by trial and error. (4) Import from Quicken had a number of errors which needed manual correction.

I could go on with user interface and feature deficiences, but I'll close with problems when installing updates.  I went through a lot of trouble when the product said it needed to update itself, which it proceeded to do, except the update didn't actually happen so it kept saying it still needed an update.  TaxCut support responded promptly via online chat, but gave me bad advice involving dubious system startup changes.  I actually found the solution in another one of these Amazon reviews when I did Google searches to find people who might have answers.  This burned off a number of hours I could have spent doing something else!

I do think TaxCut is adequate for relatively simple returns but I'm giving it a low 2-star rating because the alternative is quite a bit better and the prices aren't much different.

PS when comparing prices, don't forget that the cost to do STATE efile is big.  (TurboTax also dings you for state efile.) Remember that to gain the benefit of TaxCut's bundled audit assistance for your state return, you must efile.

PPS I also reviewed TurboTax 2008 when users were rebelling against the stupid pay-for-print policy.  At the time I gave them one star, but now that the policy has changed I would raise my rating, except Amazon has no way to change a rating once published.

Since both problems prevent customers from updating the program from the H&R Block web servers, customers must correct both problems manually before any updates from H&R Block are possible.

Who it affects: Mac customers who both: 1) have multiple login accounts on the Mac and 2) attempt to run H&R Block At Home 2009 from a non-admin account.

Problem #1: During the installation process the initial update fails due to file permissions.  Error message is: ""1008:5,-5000 Access denied error.  You do not have enough access privileges for this installation""

Resolution: 1) Stop the program installation and log in under the admin account, 2) open a Finder window, 3) open the Applications folder, 4) uninstall the H&R Block 2009 program by dragging the icon to the Trash, 5) in the Finder window open the Utilities folder, 6) run the Disk Utility program, 7) select your hard drive as the disk upon which to operate, 8) click on the ""Repair Disk Permissions"" button and wait for that process to complete, 9) reinstall the H&R Block 2009 program under the admin account.

Problem #2: When running H&R Block 2009 using a non-admin login account, the program crashes immediately upon launch due to file permissions.  Error message is: ""Initialization Failed. Exception thrown during initialization: File open failed. File = /Users/Shared/H&R Block/2009/update.tim in open:MacFileWriterImpl""

Resolution: 1) Exit the program and log in under the admin account, 2) open a Finder window, 3) open the Macintosh HD icon, 4) open the Users folder, then the Shared folder, then the H&R Block folder, 5) right-click on the 2009 folder, 6) select ""Get Info"" on the menu, 7) on the pop-up window in the ""Sharing & Permissions"" section set ALL permissions that say ""Read Only"" to instead say ""Read & Write"", 8) return to the Finder window and open the 2009 folder, 9) right-click on the update.tim file, 10) select ""Get Info"" on the menu, 11) on the pop-up window in the ""Sharing & Permissions"" section set ALL permissions that say ""Read Only"" to instead say ""Read & Write"".

Upon successful resolution of both of these problems the customer will be able to run H&R Block 2009 from a non-admin account to do their taxes.  As of the date of this note however (1/22/2010) all program updates must still be made using the admin account.

I discovered and diagnosed this on my own machine.  Fortunately I'm a geek and so was able to figure out the problem & share it with others.  Obviously H&R Block did not test this scenario before they shipped the program.  Dunno if a similar problems exists on Windows machines.  Also dunno if there will be further problems when I download & install the State program.  I haven't gotten that far yet.

UPDATE Problem #3: I installed the Maryland state program tonight (1/27) when it became available for download.  Given the problems above I used the admin account to do the install and then switched back to my normal account.  Ran the program: no Maryland state tax program installed!  And you're only allowed to download it one time without paying again!  Turns out the state program downloads into the directory ~/Library/Application Support/H&RBlock/2009/ (for non-techies ~ means starting at your home directory) and a non-shared plugin is created.  This thwarts other accounts from using the state program.

Resolution: Using a Finder window in the admin account copy the file ~/Library/Application Support/H&RBlock/2009/Completed Updates/md.dmg (for other states replace md.dmg with your state's abbreviation e.g. va.dmg for Virginia.)  Paste this into a shared directory such as Macintosh HD/Users/Shared.  Go back into your normal account and copy that same file from the Shared directory into your own ~/Library/Application Support/H&RBlock/2009/Completed Updates/ directory.  Double click on that file (md.dmg in my case.)  A new window will pop up and you'll see a new file which starts with your state's two-letter abbreviation.  In my case it was called MD.TCstate09.  Double click on that file.  Another window will pop up which says it is installing the state plug-in.  After that, you'll be able to use the state program under your normal user account as you intended.

Don't ask me how to update all of this mess at this point when H&R Block is ready to push out new program updates.  Do you use the admin account?  The user account?  Who knows?  It might even depend upon whether you are updating the Federal or the State return.  What a mess!

H&R Block really blew it this year on multi-user account support, at least on the Macs.

I have liked H&R Block in the past and they are cheaper than TurboTax.  This year, however, makes it difficult to remain a loyal customer.  We'll see what I do in tax year 2010.

I immediately began my battery draining, on hold session and was greeted by someone who obviously did not have a clue at to what I was  talking about.  Then after several discertatiions of the problem and finally getting some glimer of recognition, I was told that I would need to call the IRS on Monday to determine if everything went through on the payment and efile.  This all happened on Thursday.  On Monday, I opened the software again and went to the Check Status screen where I was told I needed to go to the payment web site and make a payment.  So I called the 800 number for the IRS and opted not wait out the predicted ""more than 45 minutes"" on hold period.  Then I called the ""At Home Customer Service Technical
Support"" to have them check again to see why the program is erroniously telling me I need to make a payment and the techie could never understand the problem, so I got what was supposed to be his supervisor on the line.  The Customer Service Supervisor finally consented that there may be something wrong with the program and her ""best advice"" was for me to return the software to Wal-Mart for a refund.  She said they had no way to resolve any problems with the program's operation or lack therof and I should return it to where I got it.",Good by TaxCut - Hello TurboTax 2010!!!

This year's version was a big step down. I didn't have the buggy installation problems other Mac users had, but there were plenty of other problems, mainly in reconciling errors in the actual forms the software creates for e-filing. The program really seemed to struggle with 1099-MISC forms, and it took me hours to fix problems in the final stages of preparation. Also, the Deduction Pro program that comes with this program was sub-standard compared to the year before; the CD-ROM version didn't work at all, and the browser-based version created a new file every time I saved (I understand why, but that's just clumsy programming).

25656,2,H&R Block,99.8,"01 21, 2010","There are two bugs that affect H&R Block At Home 2009 for some Apple Mac users.  Since both problems prevent customers from updating the program from the H&R Block web servers, customers must correct both problems manually before any updates from H&R Block are possible.

Who it affects: Mac customers who both: 1) have multiple login accounts on the Mac and 2) attempt to run H&R Block At Home 2009 from a non-admin account.

Problem #1: During the installation process the initial update fails due to file permissions.  Error message is: ""1008:5,-5000 Access denied error.  You do not have enough access privileges for this installation""

Resolution: 1) Stop the program installation and log in under the admin account, 2) open a Finder window, 3) open the Applications folder, 4) uninstall the H&R Block 2009 program by dragging the icon to the Trash, 5) in the Finder window open the Utilities folder, 6) run the Disk Utility program, 7) select your hard drive as the disk upon which to operate, 8) click on the ""Repair Disk Permissions"" button and wait for that process to complete, 9) reinstall the H&R Block 2009 program under the admin account.

Problem #2: When running H&R Block 2009 using a non-admin login account, the program crashes immediately upon launch due to file permissions.  Error message is: ""Initialization Failed. Exception thrown during initialization: File open failed. File = /Users/Shared/H&R Block/2009/update.tim in open:MacFileWriterImpl""

Resolution: 1) Exit the program and log in under the admin account, 2) open a Finder window, 3) open the Macintosh HD icon, 4) open the Users folder, then the Shared folder, then the H&R Block folder, 5) right-click on the 2009 folder, 6) select ""Get Info"" on the menu, 7) on the pop-up window in the ""Sharing & Permissions"" section set ALL permissions that say ""Read Only"" to instead say ""Read & Write"", 8) return to the Finder window and open the 2009 folder, 9) right-click on the update.tim file, 10) select ""Get Info"" on the menu, 11) on the pop-up window in the ""Sharing & Permissions"" section set ALL permissions that say ""Read Only"" to instead say ""Read & Write"".

Upon successful resolution of both of these problems the customer will be able to run H&R Block 2009 from a non-admin account to do their taxes.  As of the date of this note however (1/22/2010) all program updates must still be made using the admin account.

I discovered and diagnosed this on my own machine.  Fortunately I'm a geek and so was able to figure out the problem & share it with others.  Obviously H&R Block did not test this scenario before they shipped the program.  Dunno if a similar problems exists on Windows machines.  Also dunno if there will be further problems when I download & install the State program.  I haven't gotten that far yet.

UPDATE Problem #3: I installed the Maryland state program tonight (1/27) when it became available for download.  Given the problems above I used the admin account to do the install and then switched back to my normal account.  Ran the program: no Maryland state tax program installed!  And you're only allowed to download it one time without paying again!  Turns out the state program downloads into the directory ~/Library/Application Support/H&RBlock/2009/ (for non-techies ~ means starting at your home directory) and a non-shared plugin is created.  This thwarts other accounts from using the state program.

Resolution: Using a Finder window in the admin account copy the file ~/Library/Application Support/H&RBlock/2009/Completed Updates/md.dmg (for other states replace md.dmg with your state's abbreviation e.g. va.dmg for Virginia.)  Paste this into a shared directory such as Macintosh HD/Users/Shared.  Go back into your normal account and copy that same file from the Shared directory into your own ~/Library/Application Support/H&RBlock/2009/Completed Updates/ directory.  Double click on that file (md.dmg in my case.)  A new window will pop up and you'll see a new file which starts with your state's two-letter abbreviation.  In my case it was called MD.TCstate09.  Double click on that file.  Another window will pop up which says it is installing the state plug-in.  After that, you'll be able to use the state program under your normal user account as you intended.

Don't ask me how to update all of this mess at this point when H&R Block is ready to push out new program updates.  Do you use the admin account?  The user account?  Who knows?  It might even depend upon whether you are updating the Federal or the State return.  What a mess!

H&R Block really blew it this year on multi-user account support, at least on the Macs.  I tried relaying this to their Customer Service (3 phone calls and 2 online Chat sessions) but they had no one who understood the Macs and no way for me to email to them my diagnosis and solutions.  They were nice and tried to be helpful but I'm not sure they got exactly what I was saying.  I hope so though.

I have liked H&R Block in the past and they are cheaper than TurboTax.  This year, however, makes it difficult to remain a loyal customer.  We'll see what I do in tax year 2010.

The problems begun when I started to introduce the schedule K-1's from MLP's and LLP's Publicly Traded Partnerships. Not only does the software state at every position that it is not supporting the calculations, which you should do yourself, but it places the results at very wrong positions; In fact, it stacks gains and passive losses in entirely forbidden ways, thus generating havoc on my return.

25661,2,H&R Block,99.8,"03 11, 2010","I've been a TurboTax (Deluxe) user for years, and have been overall satisfied with it. Having said that, it is expensive, and this year I was considering upgrading to the TurboTax Premier version or a similar product. Before doing so, I decided to explore other options, with the goal being to get the simplest and cheapest package that would do what I needed, was reliable, and accurate. First, I downloaded the free version of TaxACT, and found it to be a reasonable package, but lacked confidence in its ability to handle the state, so didn't go ahead with it by buying the Deluxe version and State addon. In reading reviews on the various products (TurboTax, TaxACT, and H&R Block), it seeemed the H&R Block package got the overall best reviews, so I decided to buy it and give it a try... For me, that was a mistake.

The good: THe H&R Block package installed without problems, and was fairly easy to adapt to. Entering information for the Federal return was relatively straightforward, and it produced the expected results. I bought the Premium package because in addition to filing 'long form', itemized deductions, and investment income, this year I will be reporting rental income and expenses and associated depreciation. Had it not been an out of state property and I was reporting only Federal, I'd have stopped here, and given the H&R software a slightly better review...

The bad: Because of the rental property being out of state, I must report to California as a nonresident, with only the rental income and expenses subject to CA taxes. This is where the disappointments began. The H&R Block software offered #in my opinion# limited guidance, and one reporting error. I think I could have overridden the error, but chose not to, and instead will go back to TurboTax. I also found the H&R Block software more cumbersome to navigate, particularly when restarting or going back to check or edit prior entries.

Overall, I'd rate them:

1) TaxACT - for Federal, Simple, inexpensive, accurate. #I did not try the State version...# Interesting note: I ran the returns (Federal portion) with TaxACT (Free) and H&R Block (Premium), and compared them. Results were identical, except that the H&R Block program included an additional form. Some digging into the IRS instructions showed that the form was not required in my situation. For this, I give TaxACT an additional *plus* for keeping the return simple. Maybe H&R Block includes it to make the return seem more complex than it really is.

2) TurboTax - Tried and True, easy to navigate. I am using the Deluxe version (vs. Premier) again this year, and even with rental property, find it completely adequate.

3) H&R Block #Premium# - Worked OK for Federal. Included unnecessary Federal form. Inaccuracies and lack of guidance for State allocation #as Non Resident#. Difficult to navigate, even for Fed #going back to update previous entries#. Overall, a disappointment. I'll just chalk up the cost of the package to a learning experience. The ""two stars"" rating is based only in its ability to handle simpler returns. As I was using the Premium version, even that rating is generous.

I now wish I had tried the TaxACT instead of H&R Block - it might have done the trick! But after the failings of H&R Block, I didn't want to risk another disappointment, and went back to what works. Maybe next year, I'll give it a try...",Going back to TurboTax

For each additional state you need to prepare, that's an additional $29.95 to download the software for that state, and of course another $19.95 if you wish to file that additional state via efile. Make sure you understand this distinction when you do your price analysis on what you should do. And also factor in the following:

As a person who has a firm understanding of the contents of her W-2, but virtually no understanding of IRS tax form terminology, the H&R Block At Home software was quite frustrating to use. I had to file Federal, NY (resident) and NJ tax returns. It starts off straightforward but once I started to have a lot of forms due to dual state filings, the navigation started to get really dicey. It was difficult to locate exactly which block of information I wanted to double check and it never gave me a full overview of the info that I have already input so that I could easily locate the section I might want to redo. The wizard would ask you questions to which I had no understanding to answer. The sort of ""on demand"" help did not at all explain what it was that this section was about, and whether I needed it. Off to google I went to find out how to answer some of those questions.

What's worse is the fact that the software is not well-integrated at all. If I use one tax program to prepare both my state returns, shouldn't it be smart enough to take the results of one state return and input them int othe other state return where needed, or at least be able to provide that information as an option? I had to hope from screen to screen just to obtain information from ny NJ return to put it into my NY return! It was not intelligent enough to see that I was employed and earned income in the state of NJ and was a full time resident in the state of NY and therefore under no circumstances should I be paying taxes on the income I earned wholly in NJ twice! The amount I initially owed New York State was through the charts because I was paying taxes essentially twice to two different states. And, given that I electronically imported the W-2 data from ADP, the software should have known that I paid local taxes, namely to New York City. In my New York return, it completely missed the withheld taxes that I already paid to New York City over the course of 2009. And believe me, when I saw the amount I owed New York State, I knew something was missed so I went over the interview/wizard input questions over and over until I could recite them. But it didn't seem to help at all until I googled what had gone wrong, and essentially it was because I did not tick one of the boxes which I initially didn't think pertained to me, and the software should have caught based upon the W2 info I gave it! I had to manually input the tax amount of my NJ tax (even though I already prepared my NJ tax using this software) to resolve my dual state/double tax situation. And, I had to fix the ""naming"" of New York City in my Federal income area because the software apparently doesn't know what anything denotes in the ""locality"" field unless it says exactly ""NYC"" (ADP imported the W2's box 20 data as ""NYC RES"" instead). I had to google that technicality about the H&R Block software in order to get the ""NYC withheld tax"" to show up.

All in all, if I had trusted the software to do my taxes this year, without looking it over the forms myself line by line with a microscope, I would have had to pay in excess of $8000 to NYS which I did NOT owe. After fixing everything and giving the dumb software exactly what it wanted in the format that it wanted, I accurately filed returns for a REFUND from New York.

I have no doubt that the H&R Block software would have been fine and dandy for someone whose tax situation is simple and straightforward, but if you know you have some additional taxes you need to file (multiple state, or local city taxes), save yourself the trouble and you will save yourself a lot of money.

In any case I checked the reviews and they all said they both could import data from financial institutions.

There are no banks listed (although most people aren't getting a 1099-INT from a Bank this year) and many major mutual fund companies (eg. Vanguard, Fidelity, ING Direct) are missing as are ETrade and Ameritrade. There are 30 companies listed most of which are fund management firms such as Loomis Sayles, Baron Funds, RS Investments, etc. T Rowe Price is supported as is Ameriprise.

25694,2,H&R Block,106.4,"02 14, 2010","I have used TurboTax for years, but this year decided I didn't want to pay the high price.  After reading reviews of H&R Block at Home I thought I would give it a try.  Despite having purchased the Deluxe version, I found this product was really only good for basic tax preparation, but if that's all you need why buy a desktop tax preparation product?  Next year I'm going back to TurboTax.  Here are a few reasons why:

1)  H&R Block required me on 2 separate occaisions to fill in a form myself before it would continue.  The first was IRS publication 525 (Recoveries).  After an hour reading the instructions and attempting to work out my situation, I finally just filled out a tax return on the TurboTax online version.  It automatically calculated what needed to be calculated and gave me the answer I needed.  So I took that information back to H&R Block at Home and continued.  But I was in disbelief that AtHome couldn't handle it.  The issue was that I amended a tax return from 2006 during the 2009 tax year and received a tax refund from my state for the tax year 2006.  However, since I had itemized and deducted state taxes in 2006 I owed the Federal government for the amount that my deduction had reduced my Federal taxes.

The second time I was required to access a form was to figure out my penalty for paying my Colorado state tax late.  Colorado has a complicated form for this but luckily you also have the option to be billed later for the penalty - which is the option I chose.  But again, I was in disbelief that the program couldn't just ask me the necessary questions and then calculate it for me.

So bottom line on this point.  I pay for a tax prep software product so I don't have to scrutinize IRS forms and manually fill out worksheets.  I'm happy to do my research on relevant tax topics so I can make the appropriate choice on a not so clear issue, but in the 2 cases above, it was black and white - fill in the correct worksheet and go.

2)  Usability.  I had read that the usability was not as sleek as TurboTax and they were right.  The main income and deductions pages do not display the dollar amounts nor a status of your the categories.  All it has is a link to ""Go To"" the category of interest.  So there is no way to tell if you've already reviewed a topic.

In addition the forms that it prints are very basic.  TurboTax prints out a nice PDF file which is well organized and easy to navigate.  AtHome just prints out a data sheet and your tax forms.  It's a pain to surf through it all and find out what you want when checking things.

Overall, my recommendation would be to pay the extra money and buy TurboTax.  Although I am not happy that Intuit continues to jack up their prices, they do have a better product.",Good for basic tax prep needs

BUT...if you are a California Resident who plans to use this program to do your state taxes, you may want to turn away.  The California State program that this software download is absolutely rubbish.  I would describe the program as incomplete, that H&R didn't bother finishing it before release.  While the program retains the same step-by-step approach, it literally asks you questions verbatim from the tax forms.

But unfortunately, At Home just didn't measure up.  When it gets to importing W-2 forms directly from employers, it offers to do so, only to tell you that it doesn't yet have a relationship with your employer.  TurboTax does.  Then when it asks me if I have a state tax refund in 2009 that might be taxable income, it basically throws up its hands in the air and tells me to go look at various IRS publications to figure out how much of that refund is taxable, offering no help whatsoever.  TurboTax steps you through all the steps and determined that not all of the refund was taxable.  When it comes to importing investment information from E*Trade, both At Home and TurboTax tell you they can do it.  But At Home quickly tells you that no, it cannot after all.

First, and this will mean I am have to look at some other software, is that it won't import txf file completely from my stock broker. It imports the amounts from all the transactions, but it won't import the dates of transactions. You then have to open each transaction manually and add buy and sell date. It requires multiple clicks, lookiing through your statements and matching the trades and such. If you are doing this alone, you are talking about 2-3 minutes per trade. When you have 400+ trades, this can be very painful (and long) :(

Second experience was with the customer service: First tried the chat. Got to a very slow (or may be servicing 10 people at a time) and rude rep who didn't have clue about any of this, but she just wanted to get off the chat. Then I called the 1800 number. The lady who picked up was polite and wanted to help me; but she didn't know much about txf import. She did her best contacting her co-workers and such and came back with ""yes, you have to manually enter the data"". Well, that won't work for me :(

To conclude, It didn't work for me. But if you do not need txf import this may still work for you. My earlier review comments (see below) are still valid. It is much cheaper than turbotax and it will get the job done if yours is s simpler scenario than mine.

Also, I found that copy-paste doesnt work on many fields while filling in data. That s a P-I-A, but not a deal breaker (to me at least)

original review follows...
---------------------

I started using TaxCut last year. I found it pretty good, and upfront about the fees (unlike Turbo Tax that told me about 25$ extra at the end of return). So I decided to use it this year as well.

I was little skeptical about all tax software this year, because I now have a new computer that runs Windows 7 (which is new), that too 64 bit version (which is few, compared to 32 bit). I was also not sure if the software can import data from my last year's return (that was created using Windows XP 32 bit). Anyway, when it came on sale at 25$, I decided to give it a go. Am glad I did - it installed without any error on my computer and imported last year's return as well (saved me a few hours entering all that stupid data). I bought the download version (not the CD), and it downloaded in a couple of minutes from Amazon (it is about 50MB). The original install has only the federal forms. You can click on ""State"" and ""buy"" one state program free - it is directly downloaded to your computer as an update. I saw some reviews saying the state program wasn't included (or wasn't available) - but that is incorrect. Just choose ""Buy State"" it lets you get a state free.

I still haven't gotten the forms from my banks, so I won't complete my returns for another month. But so far everything has been smooth. I usually don't write review until I have used the product extensively, but I decided to write the review here anyway, because I thought the information about Win 7 64 bit support and import from last year's 32bit returns would help someone (I couldn't find that anywhere when searching).","simple and cheap, but won't import txf files properly"
25701,2,H&R Block,106.4,"01 18, 2010","I've used H&R Block TaxCut (now H&R Block At Home) in the past and have been very satisfied.  However this year I had two serious permission problems on the Mac.  Fortunately I'm a geek and so was able to figure out solutions.

The problem is only likely to crop up if you have multiple user accounts on the Mac, and use a non-Admin account to run the H&R Block At Home software.  Otherwise, if you're running with full Admin (root) privileges these bugs should not arise.

The first problem came right after I installed the program and it tried to do its initial update.  It failed with the following error messages: ""1008:5,-5000 Access denied error"" and ""You do not have enough access privileges for this installation"".  I had been running as a standard user so I switched to the Admin account, but to no avail.  I even tried running Mac's Disk Utility program and did a Repair Disk Permissions with no success.  I had to delete the program, re-run Disk Utility -> Repair Disk Permissions with the program gone, then reinstall the program as Admin.  Then and only then would it do a program update and continue on.

However, for security reasons I don't like to run as Admin, so I went back to my standard user account at that point.  Then the second problem came up.  When I tried to start the program as a normal user I got the following error message: ""Initialization Failed.  Exception thrown during initialization: File open failed.  File = /Users/Shared/H&R Block/2009/update.tim in open:MacFileWriterImpl"".  After puzzling over that for a bit I realized what was wrong and confirmed it by dropping down into the underlying Unix OS underneath Mac OS X.  And that is, H&R Block has the permissions set wrong for the file specified above and for the folder (or directory) containing that file.  Sure enough, an ls -l in Unix confirmed that the permissions on that directory do not grant write access to anyone other than the owner of the file & directory. For those of us who create multiple accounts on the Mac, and who installed the program using the Admin account, mere mortal user accounts will not be able to modify that file.  (And I suspect the file keeps track of the last update attempt, which normally occurs immediately upon program initialization, which is why it crashes the program right away.)

So the fastest way for me to fix the problem was to go back to the Admin account, open up a Unix window using Mac's Terminal utility, change directories (cd) down to the 2009 directory, and reset the permissions with ""chmod go+w 2009"" ""cd 2009"" and ""chmod go+w update.tim"" for the file as well.  Then everyone (group and other) can write to the file.  Went back to the standard user and - well of course it worked!

Those two solutions should help those of you who are comfortable with a bit of the techie side of Mac OS and/or Unix.  However for the others, this is clearly a permissions bug in the H&R Block At Home software which I hope they get pushed out to their customers quickly.  However they'll have to walk their customers through it verbally, since unless you can update the program online, you can't install the patches to fix the installation & update bugs.  I called technical support tonight and reported the problem, cause, and solution, so hopefully their Customer Support call centers will be able to help other customers.

I'd love to give the program more stars, but I fear these two permission bugs are going to cause a lot of grief to a lot of H&R Block customers who own Apple computers.  Hopefully however this will help some folks get up and running.

Three updates since I originally posted this review:

1) I should have provided instructions to users to fix the permissions using non-Unix commands.  So here goes using the Apple Mac OS X interface: a) sign on as Admin, b) open a Finder window and navigate down to /Users/Shared/H&R Block, c) right-click on the 2009 folder, d) select ""Get Info"" on the menu, e) on the pop-up window in the ""Sharing & Permissions"" section set ALL permissions that say ""Read Only"" to instead say ""Read & Write"", e) navigate into the 2009 folder and repeat the permission change instructions for the update.tim file.  You're done & now your standard user account can run H&R Block At Home.

2) H&R Block pushed out an update tonight (1/21/2010).  As an experiment I tried updating the program from my standard user account.  It ran to completion with no errors however after finishing told me that I still had that same update that needed to be done ... which means it didn't update the files on disk after all.  So the permission bugs persist, at least for now.  You'll have to perform all updates using the Admin superuser account (that worked) but if you do that you can at least run the program as a normal user.

3) I installed the Maryland state program tonight (1/27) when it became available for download.  Given the problems above I used the admin account to do the install and then switched back to my normal account.  Ran the program: no Maryland state tax program installed!  And you're only allowed to download it one time without paying again!  Turns out the state program downloads into the directory ~/Library/Application Support/H&RBlock/2009/ (for non-techies ~ means starting at your home directory) and a non-shared plugin is created.  This thwarts other accounts from using the state program.

Resolution: Using a Finder window in the admin account copy the file ~/Library/Application Support/H&RBlock/2009/Completed Updates/md.dmg (for other states replace md.dmg with your state's abbreviation e.g. va.dmg for Virginia.)  Paste this into a shared directory such as Macintosh HD/Users/Shared.  Go back into your normal account and copy that same file from the Shared directory into your own ~/Library/Application Support/H&RBlock/2009/Completed Updates/ directory.  Double click on that file (md.dmg in my case.)  A new window will pop up and you'll see a new file which starts with your state's two-letter abbreviation.  In my case it was called MD.TCstate09.  Double click on that file.  Another window will pop up which says it is installing the state plug-in.  After that, you'll be able to use the state program under your normal user account as you intended.

Don't ask me how to update all of this mess at this point when H&R Block is ready to push out new program updates.  Do you use the admin account?  The user account?  Who knows?  It might even depend upon whether you are updating the Federal or the State return.  What a mess!

H&R Block really blew it this year on multi-user account support, at least on the Macs.  I tried relaying this to their Customer Service (3 phone calls and 2 online Chat sessions) but they had no one who understood the Macs and no way for me to email to them my diagnosis and solutions.  They were nice and tried to be helpful but I'm not sure they got exactly what I was saying.  I hope so though.

I have liked H&R Block in the past and they are cheaper than TurboTax.  This year, however, makes it difficult to remain a loyal customer.  We'll see what I do in tax year 2010.

Have to hand it to them, what a great business idea: Copy IRS instructions, put them in a program and then sell it.

I won't get into other issues, such as an inability to explore where certain numbers came from that are on the form (where did my K-1 get the number on line 14c??), or the fact that in order to add Cost of Goods Sold you have to go to the IRS form directly (and never return to that section again unless you WANT it to erase that info and have you enter it again), or a myriad other items that were annoying.

25710,2,H&R Block,99.8,"01 21, 2010","The section that follows is my first impression of the Business program, generated on January 15. At the end of that, I include my second impression on February 15 of the business program (1120S). I'll include a review of the 1040 portion of this software after I do those taxes. OK, that review is in at the very bottom. I'd rate the 1040 as 4-stars.

Ok, I knew H&R was a little more primitive than TurboTax (which I used for 10 years or so), based on my experience with their personal tax package for 2008 taxes, but it was adequate. So this year I tried the Business software (S corp), the only part of this combo-burrito I've tried so far. It is REALLY primitive:

1. First, don't necessarily expect to be able to make sense of the display! The program may show up on your monitor with the check boxes bearing NO spacial relationship to the actual choices. So you call the help desk, and someone tells you to reset your monitor properties to display 1024x768. Oh and make sure that under ""Advanced"" the dpi resolution is set to 96. The is the only software I've ever used that couldn't recognize my monitor and display correctly. Massive lameness -- and it took 2 long tech support calls to fix it.

1.5. For a while, tech support thought the software was corrupt. I had registered it but BECAUSE I BOUGHT THE SOFTWARE FROM AMAZON, H&R BLOCK HAD NO RECORD OF MY REGISTRATION. So if the software had actually been bad, they could not have downloaded a clean version -- I would have had to return the box to Amazon for a refund and reorder it!! And the tech support person noted that Amazon would probably not take it back because it had been opened! Be warned -- if you really want this stuff, pay the man and download it from H&R Block.

2. Recognize that tech support people have just been hired and will not really know anything, tho they will be friendly and eager to help. Plan to spend an hour or two with vague directions trying to get where you're trying to go. Cultivate a Zen state of mind...

3. Expect the ""interview"" questions to be something like: ""Did you have any 53(c) sect 89 reclaimable charge-backs loss amortizations for deductible klefnabulator expenses?"" When you look for more information, there isn't any. When you check out the IRS instructions, they say (surprise!) exactly what the ""interview"" question said. TurboTax asks you in English, tells you what the amount applies to, and even tells you how commonly this item is entered.

4. Don't expect the program to be smart about anything. TurboTax figures out that if you don't have deduction A, you can't possibly have B or C, but H&R Block asks you every question.

5. Don't expect to be able to import from QuickBooks or last year's taxes produced by TurboTax. Generate those reports and type in your numbers.

6. Don't expect all the forms to be there -- and don't expect the software to let you know. I tried and tried to get to Form 4562, Amortization and Depreciation, and ended up at several different dead-ends. I again called tech support and talked at length with a guy who took me through more dead-ends before finally discovering that the form ""hadn't been released by the IRS yet."" You might think the software itself would let you know, but you'd be wrong.

7. To switch between your 1120S and filling out a 1099-misc for a contractor is not intuitive. Another call to tech support. For 20 minutes or so, the guy didn't seem to understand what a 1099 was, or even understand that I was working on an S-Corp return and not a 1040(!). More dead ends. Finally, he got help and told me to close the program and reopen it to get where I wanted to go.

8. I then gave up. I should say that I did all this stuff on Jan 15, which I admit is early in the year. So if things improve markedly, I'll update this review.

9. Meanwhile, based on this experience, I would say that the fact this combination package is about half the price of the separate TurboTax business and personal packages, does NOT make it a good deal! It is easy for me to loath Intuit, but next year I'll most likely be doing business with them again. Sigh.

Here's an business tax update on February 15. The updated software still doesn't recognize my monitor, but at least I knew what to do this time and finished filling out taxes fairly quickly. I have done my own taxes for years and had QuickBooks reports and prior year forms. Dollar-wise, the program is off from what I calculated from QuickBooks by about $104, but at this point I'm not quibbling. Nothing has changed from what I said in January, although it seems that all the forms are now available. The interview still seems quite stupid -- and it makes mistakes: I filled out the tax form for an S corporation, which NEVER pays taxes, and the program asked me how much estimated tax I'd paid and tried to get me to pay a penalty for not paying -- AND the business lost money last year! (How often do YOU pay taxes on money you've lost?] Plus, when I opened the file I'd saved from January, the program did not remember where I was but started over at the beginning. Very lame. Yes, TT costs twice as much, but it terms of ease of use and lower stress factor, it is probably worth it. Sigh. I really expected more.

Feb 26, 2009. I've just finished my personal 1040 taxes, and my what a difference! This part of the software is professional, smooth, and easy to use. It recognizes my monitor (ta da!) so I don't have to reconfigure my system to run it. However, I changed the location of my tax file, and it did not remember that. It's a little different than TurboTax, but seems to work fine. Only disadvantage I can see compared to TT is that there is no way to see a WYSIWYG version of your forms (what they show you has the information but does not look much like the paper in your hand) and their reporting and comparison functions at the end are not as complete or complex as TT. But it does the job, and the interview is friendly and intelligent.

Now the question is: Knowing that the business software is lousy and the personal stuff is good, what you gonna do?","Lousy business software, just fine for my 1040"

25712,2,H&R Block,99.8,"10 1, 2010","I bought the hard box copy and had no issue installing the business and personal software on my Windows XP computer.  I did the S-Corp Federal and State return without much problem although it was not intuitive to use.  My S-Corp has been hiring an accountant for the previous 4 years to do taxes, so I studied what she did and was able to finish the return without much problem.  However, if I had no knowledge of how to do S-Corp return, the software by itself was not enough to explain amortization and depreciation.

On the personal tax return.  I found a major bug in the state portion.  I have rental properties, S-Corp income, personal wages, some investments, sold and bought a house, did some energy improvement construction, etc.  It wasn't complicated, just a lot of items and I didn't want to miss any deductables.  I used this software to make my task easier.  While I found the Federal was working ok, the state portion had major problem.  I double check the Federal and my manual calculations had the same result.  I printed the State return and closed the program.  The next night, I opened the program and found that ehe Federal return refund figure was the same but the State was about $20 more.  I didn't do anything to the file and I went through all data input comparing to the hard copy I printed.  All figures are the same but the refund amount was different.  I worried and redid the State return.  Strangely, the refund went up $200 after that with the same figure.  I printed it out and did it manually and found a major error in the program tax return.  I have 2 children and the State only showed 1 while the Federal showed 2.  The problem is I cannot manually changed it in the State return because it used the data I input in the Federal return.  However, the Federal showed correctly.  So I went the Federal portion and uncheck the boxes next to my kids and then recheck the boxes.  Now the State shows that I have 2 dependants and the refund went up another $300.  I printed the State return and did not see anything wrong this round.  I have lost all my confidence in this software and while it cost a lot less than Turbo Tax, I am going to switch to Turbo Tax next year since I used Quickbook and Quicken.  I always double check with manual calculations which kind of defeat the purpose of using these DIY software, however, I like the aspect that it copies the depreciation information from the previous years which saves me time to dig up what I depreciate the year before.

One warning though - while the state tax program is included in this version, state e-filing is an additional charge of $19.95.

I find the 2009 version to be the same as I remember from the past - not user friendly and requires too much error checking from the user.  For example, it took me a long time to realize that the program was labeling my wife's W2 income as my income (married filing jointly) and thus was excluding us from the Child Care Tax Credit.  I have no idea why the program behaved this way, because my wife's w2 employer information was imported from last year's return. The included Deduction Pro application is not very useful; it is just a simple summation of charitable and medical deductions.

I was perfectly happy with TurboTax, but it turns out that H&R Block's software was both less expensive and easier to use.

In previous years I had no problem loading the software on WindowsXP. With a new Windows7 64bit machine, running as ""administrator"" (right click the ""tcauto"" install icon to see this option) allowed the installation of Premium Home, but the Business side continues to hang as reported by others here.

Update: No problem installing on Windows XP. Still, rather inconvenient and unacceptable.

Update #2: Business did not install on Windows7 32Bit either. One reviewer reported success on Windows7, but it has failed for me on both a Windows7 64bit and 32bit computers.

Update#3: Finally able to install Business following advice from Yan Zhang. Be prepared to jump through some hoops.
1) Start ""task manager"" by right clicking anywhere on the task bar at the bottom of your screen.
2) Run ""tcauto"" as ""administrator"" and start the business installation.
3) In the task manager click the ""processes"" tab. Look for ""update*32"" with the description H&R Block (It took several minutes for it to appear) and end the process.
4) The program will now continue installing, but its update function will not work.
5) Do an internet search for ""H&R Block engineTC.exe"" and download it.
5) Run the update. The program should work properly now.

A final parting shot: Premium Home easily imported last year's data from a saved file. Business, however, would not. It required that I install Taxcut 2009 (with similar install problems judging from other reviews). As a work around, I went back to the window XP computer that had both 2009 & 2010 installed, imported, then did a backup of a 2010 file and used this to do a ""restore"" on the windows7 machine.

It's a good program, and I think it's great for 1.) novices who don't need to use a professional tax preparer and 2.) professionals who want to prepare returns for their family or friends, and don't who don't have access to a industrial-grade program at their office for that purpose.

However, as with all things, you get what you pay for. But this year - you get even less. I had a more active year then usual in the stock market, and when I read my brokerage statement, I found that I was going to have to record over 100 stock sales on my tax return. (Due to the way the broker records stock sales, I may have given an order to sell, say 1000 shares of stock, and it was actually sold in ten 100 share transactiosn - and is being reported to the IRS that way, so I've got to match it on my return or explain it later to the IRS)

So I entered my first couple of sales on the interview page for ""Sales of Stock...Form 1099-B"" and find out that this is great for folks who don't ahve a lot to enter, but ater thirty this became very tedious. The interview form is not designed for repititive data entry work. I looked to the right-hand side  of the page and saw a question ""What if I have a lot of transactions to enter?"" OK - that's me. The answer was simple. WHne you enter a transaction, click on the ""Whole Form"" button to switch to the worksheet view, and you can then just enter data.

I tried that and I sailed through the next entry. Then I tried to paste the description of the transaction (After all when you seven entries that read CALL AAPL 6/17/2010@22.50 to enter, it's easier to just paste the data each time) and then discovered - you can't paste in the worksheet form. But you can paste if you're in the slower interview form.

I called H&R Block's customer server to make sure I wasn't makign a mistake. Nope. Her advice was to highlight the data I wanted to past, use Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V to copy can paste. If that didn't work, then I have to manually type it in.

So I'll either have to manually typoe everything in, force myself to slog through the interview form, or forgoe electronic filing, and enter a manually override amount, and attach the copy of the broker's statement to a paper copy tax return. None of these sound appealing.

I found that it did not import all of the information from last year's California return to this year's. So when I went to e-file, I had to look up and enter my California AGI rather than have it entered from last year's data package. That may not seem like a big deal, but regardless of the fact that I did enter it correctly, the State rejected the e-file twice and I ended up mailing it in.

It also did not list the Use tax rate for each county as it did in 2009. This is a little used field for self-reporting out-of-state purchases (such as those made on Amazon) and paying Use tax on them. I went to the Board of Equalization website to find the rate for my county but found that the rates are not broken down into sales and use. Since the tax rate hasn't changed since last year, I opened the 2009 return, found the rate and then manually entered it.

It also absolutely would not fill out form 3801. Despite following the instructions exactly as listed and attempting to manually enter what should have been imported from the Federal return, it would not take my entries. The instructions told me to print out a corresponding Federal form, look up the instructions for that form, fill out the worksheets accordingly, and then import them into the California worksheet. Are you kidding me?!?!? Isnt' this what the software is supposed to do?

Nonetheless, I did all of that only to discover that it would under no circumstances take my entries.

If you have a simple California return with nothing but W2 wages and standard itemized deductions then this software may work just fine for you.

I'd check online to see if HR (or TT) can import from your bank or you will spend a lot of time doing what you are trying to avoid by buying this!

Second, HR was unclear about capital gains and losses.  Had I used only HR, I very well could have reported a gain instead of a loss! To be fair, if it had imported the forms, it might have figured it out.  Even once I figured out where to enter the various numbers, I used the numbers from TT instead of entering the cost basis for every small transaction (and to calculate the basis with HR you'll have to use another (free) program).

Generally, the HR program is clunky:  TT asks you questions and tells you what your answer means; HR just tells you to click if you qualify for the ""1044 exemption for standing on your head.""  I've done my taxes on my own every year til now, and HR was basically the same thing.

25776,2,H&R Block,55.9,"04 11, 2012","I purchased this package to file a 2011 C-Corporation return for a small business after reading reviews that TurboTax 2011 Professional was buggy this year.  This was also the cheapest option.

Installation:  Long and convoluted.  After downloading the package, H&R Block installed the personal and business products separately, and each has a different installation interface.  There was a separate Microsoft .NET installation.  Installation took about 15 minutes, and the overall experience felt bloated and inefficient.

After all that - when I first started my return, H&R Block required me to download and install an updated version - another 5 minutes.  Then when I need to complete additional federal forms - more installation!

User interface & functionality:  The product does little more than re-format the questions already on the various IRS tax forms.  There's very little coaching on how to answer questions - clicking on help opens the IRS provided instructions.  Many screens didn't even bother interviewing me - just had an instruction to open the ""Whole form"" - forcing me to navigate through the IRS form and reference the IRS instructions.

The final error-check gave me errors for missing forms - although the application had already determined those forms weren't needed.  I needed to manually delete the blank forms.  The error-check reported that I needed to answer a question Yes/No - even when No was already selected.  These False errors make me wonder about the quality of the error checking behind the scenes.

The application has poor error handling and tends to freeze frequently.  For example, I deleted lines I didn't need on a 1120 worksheet, and when I deleted the last remaining line, the software just froze.  I also tried to save my return as a PDF, and the software froze when it couldn't render one of the forms properly.

Summary:  H&R Block doesn't focus on making the experience easy and valuable for the end user.  I saved only a little time had I known which IRS forms to complete using the corresponding IRS instructions.  Use it only if you're looking for a little bit of automation and are comfortable figuring out the IRS forms on your own.",Poor user interface and functionality
25777,2,H&R Block,55.9,"03 17, 2012","I have used the H&R product for several years.  The quality has gone down over the last couple of years, but I hung with for one more try this year.  It still has all of the forms readily available, but the help system is sub-par.
My biggest complaint with this is that the help system is not very helpful.  Most of the forms have to downloaded from the web and the many of the answers are either not specific, or they direct you to the government forms.  Things along the lines of: Check this box if your are a qualified business according to state regulations XX-XXXX.  If I already knew that, I wouldn't have asked for help.  They could at least break out what the essence of the qualification is - sometimes they do, most often they do not.
Also it asks questions but provides no link to any help at all - like what does this mean and how do I know if I am this category or that?  You have to go dig through the government forms to try to figure out the answers too often.  It would be nice for the software to break out some of the bureaucrat-ese into something approaching English.
And as mentioned in other reviews, the UI is not very intuitive or friendly.  Getting from one page to another can be a vexing experience.  There is limited cut & paste ability.  The review lists errors and warnings, but gives little, if any, indication of what you have to do to fix them, and making direct changes results in further warnings.  One warning is that you changed a value manually, but telling it that I understand and want that new value (so stop the warning) is not intuitive.
Overall, this looks like it would be more helpful to a professional tax preparer that has a pretty good idea of what some of the esoteric rules are, not so much for a guy just trying to get through the annual tax ordeal without spending hundreds of dollars.  I think I will try Turbo Tax next year - it costs a bit more, but the last time I used it (several years ago!) it was overall friendlier.",Not helpful for non tax professional

But I did not purchase this program for just the personal tax preparation, I purchased this specific version to handle a business return.  When you install this version of the program you are actually installing two seperate programs, the personal and business tax preparation programs.  Which makes some sense, I suppose.

What makes no sense though is wide divergence in quality between the two programs.  The business return preparation looks like a half thought out version of the personal program (seriously it looks like it should have ""version .01"" listed somewhere).  On the personal side of things you have the option of viewing the whole tax form that is being filled out, not so with the business program.  It's always right there in front of you taking up two thirds of your screen.  Which makes me wonder why not just go to [...] then print the form, then fill it out by hand.

But, putting aside the clunky entry system and the overall appearance, good luck trying to print the return into a pdf (it comes with it's own pdf writer).  The pdf writer can be used by other programs and works well WITH OTHER PROGRAMS but for some reason does not seem to work with the business program.

My favorite moment however, was having the program tell me that there was no interview available for South Carolina, despite the fact that I had not only download and installed the South Carolina state version but was also able (after some searching) to pull up the SC Corporate return.

Got the disk and was cruising along, actually enjoying the interface a bit more than that of TurboTaxes past.

Then I got to entering ""Child and Dependent Care Providers"" and encountered what is simply an unbelievable flaw/mistake/blunder/screw-up/crime in the H&R Block software:

If you have to enter more than FOUR providers, you can no longer stick with the interview process. You'll have to work with a VERY different looking interface AND you WON'T be able to efile! Unbelievable. Oh, and they just naturally assume that you're working on a computer hooked up to a printer. Nice assumption, Block programmers/testers/quality control folks.

Where they came up with FOUR providers as a cutoff for ease vs. banishment to the Twilight Zone is never explained. But in my middle-class world, where kids often go to a different summer camp each week, we use more than four providers. And if you have more than one child, multiply by 2,3 or whatever. It's a reality familiar to MILLIONS of families.

The H&R Block customer service people are pleasant on the phone but none can explain this bizarre issue. The best they could do was offer me a refund. Would really love to know how this thing got through quality testing. Maybe they just didn't know about parenting in the real world.

I'll take the refund. And maybe I'll have to go back to TurboTax if I can't figure out how to deal with the care providers thing. And then there's printing. And the U.S. Postal Service.

Here's the 500+ word instructions. You've been warned. Read them and weep:

""Why can't I enter more than 4 providers?
The program limits the number of providers to 4. If you want to enter information for more than 4 providers, follow these steps:
If you already entered a 4th provider, you'll need to change the information entered on that copy. Hit the Edit button to do so. On the next screen, delete the information you have entered.
If you only have 3 providers entered, begin a 4th by hitting the Add button.
Where you are prompted to enter
Provider Name type ""See attached list"".
At the bottom right of the screen, click Show Form. Click Whole Form and scroll down to Part III. The first line in Part III is Amount paid to provider. Place your cursor in that field. Right - click in this entry field. Select
Add Itemized List.
You will get a pop-up window where you can enter many lines. The left column is for text and the right column is for numbers. At the top you can enter a Title. Enter ""Additional Child and Dependent Care Providers.""
On the top line of the left column enter the name of the 4th provider. Just under that, enter the address, including the ZIP code. Use 2 lines for the address if you need to. On a 3rd (or 4th) line, enter the providers EIN or SSN. In the second column, next to the name, enter the amount paid to that provider.
To enter the 5th provider, begin just below the EIN or SSN from the 4th provider and enter the name in the left column, then the address and then the EIN or SSN as you did before. Enter the amount paid to that provider in the right column. Enter a 6th, 7th, or 8th provider the same way until you have entered all your providers and payments.
When you are done entering your providers, click the Print button -- printing the list for your tax return. Then click OK to dismiss the popup box.
In the upper right, click the Close Form button. You are returned to the interview. Don't worry if you don't see the sum of your entries on this screen. Click Next and indicate who care was provided for and then (if applicable) you'll need to indicate if anyone was disabled.
The last screen is designed to show a provider's name, EIN or SSN and the amount paid. You should see ""see attached list"" in the name field and for expenses paid to provider, you should see the sum of all your entries in this itemized list you entered earlier.
You will be attaching the printed list to your tax return. You will not be able to e-file. You need to add information to the printed page so that it is ready to file with your tax return.
First, next to RE 2011 Tax Returns, write Form 1040 (or 1040A if you intend to switch to 1040A -- it isn't necessary).
Draw a line through ""Form W-10 Line 000 Copy 4"" and next to it write ""Form 2441, Line 1""
On the right, the list will already show the taxpayer name and SSN. If this is a joint return, manually write the spouse name and SSN below that.""",WARNING: Not for Parents with Dependent Care Providers

After using Turbotax  to prepare my income tax return for a number of years I decided to try H&R Block.  Among other things this software decided I operated a business in 2011 (which I did not) that I made a profit in that business of over $6,000 in 2011 (which I did not) and when I tried to remove that False information from my return refused to allow me to do so.  While that was the most serious problem I had with the software, it came up with several other errors that it also firmly refused to allow me to correct.

Finally, when I tried to contact H&R about those problems (they do ""guarantee"" their products) I discovered that the only things you can easily contact them about are TAX problems, not software problems.

When I saw this HR Block software deal, I decided to take a chance on it since the description stated that it would import our Turbo Tax data.

I've been using H&R Block's tax prep software (the Deluxe version) for at least 20 years and always found it the easiest to use and it provided good reporting. Until  this year's version. I prepared my first return - I do a few - last night and  first imported the data from last year's (2010) return  and then entered the data for 2011. There was a fairly large variation in the tax owed and so I thought I may have entered an incorrect amount. What I usually do then id go to ""Forms"", then ""All Forms"" and then choose ""Two-year summary"". This report compares each summary line on the return with the previous year - allowing you to spot an obvious error. But, the report was not listed. I thought maybe they renamed it and did a search. No luck. So I called H&R Block Tech support and spoke to two different staff there. When I showed them that, if they looked at list options under Forms for the two years they would find ""Two Year Summary"" missing. After being placed on hold for 3-4 minutes, the reps each told me "". No that form is not included this year"". They had no explanation why.

In my opinion, this is one of the most useful fo9lms and H&R has taken one BIG step backward. The only way to do a comparison is to PRINT out both the 2011 and the 2010 returns and match the lines by hand. This wastes paper and takes time.

This may very well be my last year with H&R Block @ Home (formerly Tax Cut). Turbo Tax costs more - and is not as user friendly - but it offers this option (as far as I know).

So I'm alerting those who might be looking for the ""Two-year Summary"" that it is no longer included and have dropped my rating from what was once a five star rating to just 2 stars.

I hope you find this review helpful.

I didn't love the software, but it was usually cheaper than the competition.  Last year, though, the IRS told us our return had an error -- to the tune of a few thousand dollars.  It was the 3rd and last year of our adoption credit claim (the credit is typically spread over 3 years because of timing of various adoption milestones).  We used the same software all 3 years -- deliberately, so it could import from the previous returns.  The interview questions about the adoption costs and carryovers were very confusing, so it's equally possible that I answered incorrectly, or that the software calculated incorrectly.  Either way, it's a flaw in the product (either in question design and terminology definitions, or in calculation) -- a flaw that has led to almost a year of letters and phone calls back and forth to the IRS, while we all try to figure out what our correct refund amount is.

I won't say don't use the product, especially if my case doesn't apply to you.  I will say don't rely on it to accurately calculate the admittedly confusing adoption credit -- if you're adopting, either try the competition, or double-check your return manually (which defeats the purpose of buying the software, if you ask me).",Did not calculate adoption credit correctly

Another surprise, installation woes. Windows 7 in 2012, and you still can't install a simple program without issues. In my case, on a quadcore AMD 64-bit Windows 7 computer. On the third installation attempt, the Program Compatibility Assistant finally sorted it out on its own and the darned thing installed.

After the successful installation, you run the software for the first time. You have the option to register it, and then it automatically checks for updates on the internet.

From within the program, you can then select to install the State Program. You get one free State program with this version, but not a free state e-file. You can purchase additional State programs if you need multiple states. Installation of the State program is a program installation in itself, you have to close the H&R software and go through the installers.

Preparing taxes was the usual routine, going through the different Q&A screens, and on and on. Navigation, usability, and explanations could have been better. The e-filing part worked without issue. The Search feature is borderline useless, it looks like something from 1999. The program gets things done when you slog through it, but after so many years at it, it should have been a lot better at it.

Another major point of irritation: you get five free federal e-files and zero state e-files. It would be more fair if they offered five free e-files and it would be up to the consumer to decide how to use them, federal or state or a combination! Overall it does what it's supposed to do, in a rather clumsy fashion, but you can get things done.

I have not used the customer support or live help options, so I can't comment on them.

Even though I have been using this program for many years, it is disappointing to see how little things have changed in terms of user-friendliness and installation and operations.

This year I decided to give this program a try when it was a gold box offer and in the end, I was impressed.  I bought the boxed version.  It installed easily.  It took a few minutes to figure out how to navigate, but not bad.  Entering my information was a breeze.  I really appreciated the little help boxes that I could click on to find out about a particular thing I was working on, eg. what was eligible for a deduction or credit or why the program did something.  I actually calculated my taxes by hand first to see how well I did.  For federal, it was pretty close.  For the state, the program alerted me to a credit I would have never found, especially as the state now does everything by pdf and who can read the whole instructions that way?  So this program got me almost $600 by catching that credit. Needless to say, I'm very happy.  After all was entered, the program checked the returns for a number of parameters (including audit risk) and then walked me through e-filing for both the state and federal.  It offered to print a reminder so that I wouldn't forget to include the state's add-on donations as charitable deductions next year, which is easy to forget.  It seems to be a well thought-out program that is very user-friendly. I will use this program in the future.

Update 2015.  Turns out I won't be using it again. The 2013TY version made a mistake (it changed a value back to an incorrect default when I reviewed the document.  Fortunately I caught it in time. I was able to reproduce the problem, confirming that it wasn't due to my being careless).  Even worse, using the software I made a mistake that IRS caught a year later.  The amount I underpaid was significant to me.  I would have had to pay it anyway, whether at the time of filing or as it turned out a year later, but it was shocking to get the notice (and penalty, though it wasn't so much).

Calling the 1-800 number informed me that I needed to be willing to wait 20+ minutes, so instead I sat on hold in a tiny chat room bubble on the HRBlock website. After being disconnected from the chat TWICE, I finally got a seemingly more stable connection, but the help agent was nearly impossible. My extra-snide and snippy digitron tech support agent looped me in circles for 45 minutes, INTENTIONALLY misunderstanding what I needed, telling me she couldn't verify my purchase, and encouraging me to pay the extra twenty bucks, probably just to be done with her. The IRS folks are far easier to deal with.

So now that I've vented on that, the product itself: the questions are easy to understand, but it did not do much for helping me understand my mortgage deductions, which is why I got it in the first place. I tried to talk to a tax professional for free (as promised), but it was such a hassle I just called the IRS, where I didn't have to hold OR enter a key code. It was a nightmare trying to figure out HSA deductions as well. The final check process was difficult to bypass once I was ready to file. (yes I KNOW I need receipts d***it!!) I also called a local H & R Block office and pleaded for a couple answers from them, and they happily complied.

It was really really good for playing the ""what-if"" scenarios. Our family has a non-traditional dependent situation and it was great at explaining dependents, exemptions, etc, and the benefits and drawbacks of each situation. The colors are very soothing, too. All those cool greens and blues really calm a girl down when she can't figure out where all the amortizazitioning points ended up.

Lastly, I bought Deluxe + State, assuming that it did indeed include the state filing. It did not. So why would they title it Deluxe *Plus State*?? Yes I committed the punishable consumer sin of taking them at their neatly packaged words, but really. Misrepresent much? Thanks, H & R Block, for making my Tax Day twice as stressful and teaching me more appreciation for the IRS help line.","For ease and convenience, shoot yourself in the foot instead."

The $19.95 charge for State Filing is absurd. They jam you with that cost because they figure people are frustrated with doing taxes, so by the time you get to that step you'll pay a premium for less hassle.

Unfortunately, the software is incorrectly computing my Massachusetts taxes this year.  Like many, I converted a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA in 2010.  Under both federal and Mass state law, I am eligible to spread the taxes owed based on this conversion between the 2011 and 2012 tax years.  The federal portion of the software had no problems, but the state version is having a problem.  Initially, it correctly splits the total Roth conversion amount in 1/2 so that it can be spread evenly between 2011 and 2012.  BUT, it then takes the entire amount and adds it to the split.

For example, if you converted a $50K traditional IRA to a Roth IRA in 2010, you should pay taxes on $25k in 2011 and $25K in 2012.  The software is doing the split, but then adding back in the $50K.

In retaliation, I bought H&R Block At Home for my 2011 return.

The software seems to get the job done, but the human interface is a bit clunky and the program has a bit of a very frustrating problem with its data verification section of the Colorado State return.  It tells me that there is an Data Verification problem which should be reviewed.  When I click continue, It shows that a field is left blank, and it is a field which SHOULD be left blank.  While the screens you see tell you that these Data Verification items can be ignored, it doesn't allow you to escape the infinite loop of:  1) Being told that there is an item needing review, 2) showing you the item, and presenting you with a ""continue"" button, which brings back the original screen telling you that there is an issue which might be ignored.  Pressing continue again, puts you right back into the loop.

After two hours on the phone with their customer service representatives, whose use of the language was at third-grade level, and whose knowledge of their product was non-existent, I finally got to a manager who actually knew something about the program.  He told me that I could continue by closing the window. I was under the False impression that hitting the ""continue"" button would allow you to . . . well, continue!!!  Silly me!

The first two customer service people clearly didn't know anything about H&R Block's forms.  The continued to ask me where in the form this box was, and I said ""Colorado State individual income tax return form 104"", and I was told for nearly two hours that there is no such form.

As I said, ultimately, the program gets a return printed, but the user interface is pretty poor and the customer service reps (at least the first two I talked to) clearly didn't know a thing about the product.  I may have to go back to Turbo Tax next year.  What's a mutha to do?","OK, but a little iffy"
25836,2,H&R Block,55.9,"12 4, 2011","I can't review this product since I have been unable to use it.  Well.....almost unable.
The selection boxes which should be displayed at the bottom of each screen to allow the user to choose what action to take next (e.g. back, continue, next, go to, etc) are not displayed.  The only way to use the program is to mouse around at the bottom of the screen and wait to see the cursor change and the text associated with a selection box to display and keep looking until you find the selection you want (e.g. Continue) and then click.  That works but it's v-e-r-y slow.  So, it's not exactly unusable.
I suggest you wait a bit before you purchase this product.  I'm going to contact H&R Block on Monday 12/5 to see what I have to do to correct the problem.  It may be something simply and, possibly, be something related to my pc.
I'll update this review once I have a solution (even if it makes me look stupid!)

12/5 Update:  During the course of an hour chat with an HR Block support person I was told to uninstall the software,disable my antivirus and firewall and then rerun the installation download .exe program.  I did this and there was no change in the problem which makes the software unusable for me.  I was also disturbed when the chat support person asked:
Thank you, may I have your date of birth and social security please?
Huh?  My answer was NO.
I'm now waiting for a response to an email I sent to HR Block asking for assistance.  A refund may not be an option since Amazon does not offer refunds on download software.
All for now.

12/6 Update
A very quick response to my email, a refund of my purchase price.  Here's the text from Amazon:

I'm sorry to hear about the trouble you've had installing and running ""H&R Block At Home Premium + State 2011.""

I'm not sure what would cause this to happen and because you have already tried trouble shooting with H&R Block, I've made an exception to our return policy and issued a refund in the amount of $64.99.

I'm not sure why the email came from Amazon and not HR Block.
I've used the HR Block software for the past 3 years and would like to continue using it and may try the cd version.

The problem came about because I had converted a former residence to a rental.  At Home's instructions left much to be desired and even after I figured out a key entry where I had been led astray (Thanks TurboTax and IRS publication 936), I could NEVER get the repair expenses to allocate correctly. Mortgage and Tax expenses were okay, but not repair. TurboTax correctly instructed me how to enter the days of use and how to assign expenses to the period as a home and to the period as a rental.

Also, while both programs were able to import information about ESPP transactions, TurboTax was better about establishing the correct basis.

Turbotax did have at least one bug, where I had to delete an entry and start over, but at least I finished and feel confident that my taxes were prepared correctly.",Wasted money - unable to correctly process first time rental

There are no program options, and it doesn't sense my preferences and accommodate them. For example, Every time I open a form, I have to maximize it and close the mini-worksheets to make it readable. Why can't HRBlock give me this option naturally?

I need to file copies of certain pages of my return with the local tax authorities. HRBlock explicitly prohibits this by graying out the page selection option on the print form, purposely making the program hard to use.

There are many other examples. It is telling that HRBlock seems to provide no place on their website for such user feedback. They don't seem to care what users think about their program or about improving it.","Ok, but it remains user-unfriendly"

This year's tax preparation proceeded normally until I tried to e-file.  My Federal return went through normally and was quickly accepted by IRS.  My state return was rejected with two ""errors"" and rejection codes. I have been trying, in vain, to determine the nature of these ""errors"" but, apparently, no one @ H & R Block knows what these rejection codes mean (or, at least, they aren't telling me)!

I'm trying to understand why my return was rejected and no one seems capable of telling me.  Instead, I'm getting a finger-pointing exercise.  After about 30 minutes online chatting w/ customer support, their suggested ""fix"" was to paper file and they suggested I contact my state Dept. of Revenue, which I did.  The DOR's response was that the rejection code was H & R Block's not theirs.  On a subsequent telephone call, I was informed that one code indicated a ""processing error"" (more finger-pointing as H & Block says it's the state's problem and the state says it's H & R Block's) and the other indicated I had changed my federal return after it had been accepted, which I had not done!

If I wanted to paper file, I wouldn't have spent the money for the state program, since I'm perfectly capable of copying my federal data onto the state forms which, after all, is basically what the state program does, isn't it?",This is most likely the last year I use this product

When I found something not sure, I would skip and get back later. Or some time I would play around with figures to see how it goes. Previous version would correct data right away in the same copy. This year I did the same and find every time I re-entered the figures, the returns grow bigger. It sounds good but at the end I found this year's H&R would create a new copy of the same form and accumulated all deduction together. That means the returns showing would not be corrected. If you send it out by efile without checking, you may be in trouble. So be very careful. The price for premium + state usually included 5 free federal filing and 1 free state filing. This year H&R charge you 19.95 for state filing if you pay by credit card and charge more if you deduct from returns.

Yes, fast and fairly easy.  What really annoys me is that they both try to get you to buy other financial software or services they sell.  Turbotax is worse in this respect.  Once they get your e-mail address, expect a lot of spam.  The sad part is, for a person who has basic (uncomplicated) tax returns, they're really both a waste of money.

I'm a ""basic"" taxpayer.  I have a job, a small military retirement pension, I rent an apartment, and have no dependents.  I have always taken the ""standard deduction"", because I don't have enough deductions to itemize.  This software tries to find deductions, but in the end I always end up taking the standard deduction.  That's fine - but why am I paying close to $40 to e-file one Federal return, and one State return?  I don't need ""5 Federal E-files"".  That's one thing not mentioned when you buy this software - they charge extra for the Federal and State e-file.  The total cost for software and e-files will be close to $60.  I suggest printing the returns off off and mailing them in to save money.  Or better yet, if you made under $57,000, try out the IRS's free tax filing system.

Oh and H&R Block - I knocked an extra star off because last year you missed the $5000 military pension deduction (for the state of Maryland tax form).  You might want to fix that.

The total cost will be $44.94 for 1 person to prepare and e-file 1 federal and 1 state return.  Add $39.95 for additional states.",Why pay the extra money?

So when I started working on my taxes using this program, I thought little of not being online.  The software has a fix for us folk who stilll don't go online: call their toll free number and order an ""update CD"" - trouble is, there is no such animal.  Instead, they recommend you download the information when running the program online.  This doesn't help me, any. I'm not going to go to the library to do my taxes online.  Their other suggestion was to download the updates to a USB flash card, then take it home.  I tried that yesterday but the software does not offer this option at their website.

So the moral of the story is this:  ""Don't purchase a tax program which assumes everyone has the internet at home!""  IT DON'T WORK !!

On a side note, I plan on using the program and NOT updating the files - just using what came with the software and taking my chances that is enough.

Unfortunately this year I stumbled upon a serious flaw in the software that prevented me from filing my return and HR Block support people were not able to help me when I contacted them.

The problem is in the integration of NY state and Federal returns.  Apparently, on NY return the spouse with income from NY sources has to be the primary taxpayer.  My wife and I live in NJ but she works in NY.  I was listed as the primary taxpayer on Federal and NJ returns, but when the program transferred data to NY return it put my wife in as the primary taxpayer and completely left out my information.  Not surprisingly the tax return was rejected by the NY.  What is more, to get it right, now I need to go into the form and override fields that were populated by the program automatically, which precludes me from e-filing my NY tax return completely.  It is a pain in the neck to go in and manually fixed all the incorrect fields.  Moreover, without e-file it is going to take a much longer time to get the refund.

I realize that my situation with having to file two different states is not typical.  Most people will probably have no problems with this software.  However, for people who have to file NY state return and/or two separate state returns I would strongly recommend to avoid HR Block.

The first concern is relatively minor, and would be an improvement. Specifically, when the customer reaches the screen for Your Preferred Refund Method, a clear, third menu line option needs to be added for the purchase of US Savings Bonds with ones tax refund. Without a clear option listed, I was totally dependent on accidently noticing a small FAQ question in the far right column to figure out how to allocate part of my refund to a bond purchase.  Also, for the software help information under-- How can I purchase U. S. Savings Bonds with my refund? -- the $5,000 limit information should be added.

My second point is of a far more serious nature. Specifically, when installing the tax software package, HR Block, included without permission a PDF software package named PDF995. Furthermore, the installation of the PDF995 software does not appear to be disclosed in the 14-page End User License Agreement (yes, I read every page of the legal jargon). Given that many users already have PDF read/write software, installation of the PDF995 software should be provided as an option during the installation process.  It is very inappropriate to add such a software package to a users hard-drive without permission.

My third point is to ask HR Block to take the high road and include in either the installation process, or as a software menu item, the option for consumers to make clear choices about the use of their personal data. Unfortunately, I had to go through the process of hunting down the privacy policy and then work through the various options.

First, I purchased the Premium program with the state, for a Mac computer.  After working on my federal taxes for 8 hours, I was ready to transfer my information to the state.  When I went to do this, I was told that my state program was not available yet.  I thought this must be a mistake because I know my daughter just did her taxes using a rival software and she said her state and federal returns had already been accepted.  I decided to save my work and get out of the program so I could do some research on it.

Needless to say, I was devastated!  I looked for an hour for my tax forms. I looked and searched in all tax files on my hard drive and my external hard drive.  I just couldn't find it.  I finally realized I was going to have to start over again, so I went back into the beginning of the software and just stared at it for awhile.

25971,2,H&R Block,80.99,"04 8, 2014","H&R Block couldn't handle withdrawals of excess Roth IRA Contributions.  I used TurboTax for several years prior to switching to H&R Block for the last 6 years.  In 2013, I had some excess Roth contributions that I withdrew along with the earnings.  H&R Block software kept putting the the data on the wrong IRS forms.  H&R also put my military retirement income on the wrong line.  I called them and they were going to tell me where to override the data to make it work.  If you override any data, you cannot e-file.  Furthermore, the IRS requires you attach a statement explaining the excess contributions.  H&R Block software does not provide a method of attaching a statement other than printing and mailing your return; you cannot e-file.  I got TurboTax Premier, and it handled all this no problem.  Otherwise, both programs computed the exact same tax due.  H&R Block Premier does well with stock/mutual fund sales, rental property, and all my Schedule A deductions.  Neither program does a good job of figuring the Kiddie Tax, but H&R Block Premier did a much better job on Kiddie Tax than TurboTax Premier.  H&R Block was easier to use since it removes steps from the process once you tell it you don't have that sort of tax situation.  TurboTax kept every kind of income and deduction on its review page even after you told them it didn't apply.  At least I thought H&R Block Premier had a cleaner look when reviewing items.  I'm asking H&R for a refund, but it's cheaper and adequate than TurboTax for those without excess Roth contributions.  Not for me.

Update: HRBlock offers a 60-day money back guarantee, but you have to mail it in to receive a refund check in the mail.  TurboTax's website offers a simple email address to request a refund.  This is my first return of either so I don't know how quickly this will go.",Switching to TurboTax Premier

Importing historical information from TurboTax to this program created a world of woe for me which I never hope to repeat, so I am unwilling to try to go back to TurboTax even though in other circumstances I would do so as fast as possible.

The Home part of Home & Business works fairly well.  In most cases what I've found is the program works adequately until you get into the really complicated stuff -- foreign tax credits, partnership income, alternative minimum tax, etc.  Then it often will dump you and refer you to IRS instructions or publications, letting you flounder.  I, at least, adopt a completely different mindset when I am using a computer program to do my returns and retain my information than I do when I am filling out paper returns and keeping my own records.  So, to have the program stop helping me in mid-return is, from my point of view, a disaster.  This is magnified on state returns where the automation is even more spotty.  If your return is relatively uncomplicated, the Home program will work fine for you.  But beware if you have less usual tax issues.

The Business part of the program is an abomination in my opinion.  I need it for its trust, partnership and real estate rental functions.  Here the programmers often punt when the going gets tough, and it's tough luck for you.  Maybe your experience will differ if you have an S Corp. or an LLC, which are more mainstream, but in my view the pretension that this program is adequate for all business users is just that.

First, I will say that the preparation of my federal return was smooth, from importing my prior year information from Turbo Tax through efiling.  That is the only reason I increased my rating from 1 star to 2.  For me, the Federal return is much easier to prepare and if you have questions to find the answers.  State returns are often much more nuanced and more difficult to find answers to your questions, therefore if a tax prep software can not properly prepare a state return, I would deem it essentially worthless for individuals in the approx 42 states that have an income tax.

Arizona, like 11 other states, does not automatically start with Federal AGI but instead each year the state legislature must pass a law that either authorizes ""conformity"" with the Federal AGI or specifies which portions of the Federal AGI must be adjusted on your state return.  Most states do this fairly promptly, however Arizona's legislators, along with those from a handful of other states, do not make this a priority, rarely passing the conformity measure before April, and often on or after Tax Day (April 15).  This delay obviously puts taxpayers a little bit of a bind if their return is impacted by anything Congress has added/changed in the AGI (or itemized deduction) calculation since the prior year.  The AZ Dept of Rev (ADOR) actually issues instructions highlighting this issue and laying out the following alternatives 1: File an Extension until the issue is addressed by the legislature, 2: file assuming conformity will NOT be approved or 3: file assuming conformity WILL be approved.  The instructions point out that if you select options #2 or #3 you will need to amend your return if your assumptions proves to be incorrect, HOWEVER based on historical likelihood (in the last decade plus, only one significant conformity issue was not approved), the ADOR actually issues tax forms and instructions assuming conformity will be approved.

Turbo Tax follows the ADOR's lead and uses forms assuming conformity will be passed.  You can use these forms to e-file, with a standard warning that if conformity is not passed, your return may need to be amended.  H&R Block, for some unknown reason, decides to go through the work of actually creating their own forms assuming conformity will NOT be passed.  You can manually ""correct"" these adjustments, however then you can not e-file.  Furthermore, H&R block does not appear to monitor this conformity issue closely and did not make any attempt to push out the update promptly after conformity was passed.

Finally, one of the particular nuances of AZ's tax code are several non-refundable tax credits that for most tax payers can actually offset 100% of the tax due.  These credits are allowed to be ""carried-forward"" to future years.  Not only was H&R block's software incapable of properly identifying my previous year's carry-forward credit, but only after H&R block had finally pushed out its conformity update did the ""error"" checking feature finally tell me that the mere existence of a unused credit (to be carried forward to next year) disqualified me from being able to e-file my state return.

Oh, and to top it all of, they still didn't patch the conformity issue correctly.  Might have to go buy another 2014 software package anyway...

Well, it does, and it doesn't - if you only own simple stocks/bonds/etc, you should be fine. But if you own any investments that send you a Schedule K-1 (PTPs, MLPs, S-corps, rental real estate), beware! Only after I had gotten halfway through the program's income interview did it ""helpfully"" inform me that my PTP income was ""beyond the scope of this year's program"", that I would have to manually alter the programs calculations and form entries, and that, by the way, that means I will be barred from e-filing entirely.

And boy, were they not joking! Not only does this software not handle PTP Schedule K-1s, it ""handles"" them massively improperly, entering the income on the wrong forms, applying deductions that it shouldn't, and generally creating a huge mess of my return. What good is tax preparation software that actually makes the process HARDER than doing them by hand??

Intuit's TT software has never had a problem with my K-1s. There's a reason they thought they could get away with their horrible pricing structure for 2014 I guess, and it's because their product actually works!

On the plus side, this HR Block program operates very similar to Turbotax. I got my income tax done, ready to file. But then I was required to update software due to an hr block tax update. After that,  the program would not start up anymore. So I  reloaded the program from CD, still would not start up. Then I rebooted the Macbook, program still wouldn't load. Called HR Block, spent about 20 minutes on the phone, now they are supposed to be sending me a link to reload a new program- which I still havent; got after one hour. So now I have wasted yet another evening on this stupid income tax. With no assurances that the same thing won't happen again. Furthermore, its too late fro me to cancel the order. So they got their money and I got nothing but wasted time. This is the last tax softare package I will ever buy.","Crappy product, crappy customer service."

However, when I was getting ready to file my return, I noticed that on Schedule D, the software had put several long-term capital gains in the short term category. This is despite the fact that the purchase dates were there and were clearly well over a year before the sell date. I have no idea why this happened or why the software seemingly can't do the simple math to determine the holding period. But it almost cost me a substantial amount of money due to the difference between the long-term and short-term tax rate.

So if you use this product, be sure to double-check Schedule D!",Marked some long-term gains as short term!
26036,2,H&R Block,47.3333333333333,"04 1, 2015","H& R Block has usually exceeded my expectations compared to the alternatives in tax software, but not this year. Errors and unwelcomed changes. Also it doe not appear the e-file codes are transferable to a new person if you give or sell the program to someone else because you have to register the software first. Probably a way for HR Block to sell more programs and shut down the used sale marketplace of their discs. This is a small point and I can't verify it, and does not come into play in the review rating.

They've changed the user interface appearance for 2014, its mostly cosmetic but definitely less appealing. What is not cosmetic is the business section for home business or small business, its more confusing this year as they've cloaked the portion where if you have a business with a running inventory (i.e. purchases, cost of goods sold). Normally this shows up right away, but this year you can go through the business section several times and completely miss it, because you have to check a tiny box about ""do you have raw materials""? and if so checking this unearths a separate part of the business interview. I guess they did this to save time for those without a business inventory, but instead it is confusing and first appears like something major is missing from the program for the rest of us.
Also, technically, they shouldn't call this part ""raw materials"", because that implies manufacturing, and not all home or small businesses do any manufacturing. Some simply resell products and technically goods purchased for resale are not raw materials. Kind of a major error I think on their part. So an experienced user could ignore this question thinking they don't have manufacturing and thus miss the entire needed section for cost of goods sold and purchases write-offs. Really stupid that HR Block did it this way.
There's also a couple errors I've found so far, one is in the home office section. The program is telling me I didn't have a home office deduction last year which could screw up this year's taxes (due to ability to back-write-off stuff to prior years) yet I used HR Block the exact same edition on the exact same computer, in fact it imported last year's return into this session. Yet their software completely missed that I had a home office. Weird, and again, stupid.
Lastly didn't get much help during the section about pensions and annuities, some perplexing blanks to be filled out that I feel H &R Block could have clarified.
This might still be a good program, or at least better than Turbo Tax and whatever else is left because I've found much less finalized errors in prior years with HR Block, and HR Block doe provide free audit support.

I was happy to buy this seeming replacement product for less money. However, this is clearly another case of ""you get what you pay for,"" and assuming TurboTax makes good on their promise to return to their previous packaging, I'll be going back to TT next year.

Basically, I felt like I was fighting with the application all the way through. While it supports the usual ""interview"" style of return preparation, the implementation of the application itself was less than ideal. Having been in the commercial software business for several decades, I recognized evidence of limited design, implementation, and testing. This occurs when management deems the product to be ""good enough"" and decides not to spend any additional money on smoothing the rough edges and finding bugs. For all you might want to say about TurboTax,, their product is definitely a cut above this one in terms of polish, reliability, and ease of use.

For example, one of the main reasons I use tax software is for the ability to import my Schedule D investment information. I'm not exactly Warren Buffet, but who wants to hand-type all that stuff? The H&R software claimed that my log-in credentials for my brokerage account were not valid, even though I could log in to the account in another tab in the same browser session. Checking the H&R website, I found that a number of people were having this same problem, and an H&R Block tech rep posted an acknowledgement of the issue..

After a few days, H&R apparently fixed this issue, although they did not make any public post of the fix in the thread where it was being discussed. However, the import did not work correctly for me. When I started the return, I brought over my last year's tax info from TT, so my two brokerage accounts were shown in the H&R return. After importing, the program created something like 6-8 new brokerage accounts in the return, scattering info from the import among them. I deleted all the accounts and then re-imported. This time, it correctly created the two accounts, but a few odds and ends of info did not make it through he import, requiring me to go through each account line by line to verify the data (which was virtually the same as having entered it myself manually). Fortunately, the gain and loss reports imported correctly (as far as I can tell) and that is the biggest pain, so I was happy about that.

I was also very frustrated with the mechanism for reporting non-cash charity donations. The process was extremely clunky at first glance, although it turned out there was a streamlined way to do it, but you had to find that out for yourself. Also, the program was quite buggy in this area, as entered information was not saved in some cases, and other anomalies cropped up.

I experienced several other instances of less-than-intuitive behavior, the most memorable being around printing my return. I eventually got the job done and the return filed, but as I said, I felt like the application had been working against me throughout the process.

I called the credit card company and they assured me H&R Block was not following through with those pending charges and they won't be on my bill. Overall this was a stressful tax season with Turbo Tax taking schedules out of the Deluxe version, charging more for them as part of the Premier version and then H&R having their software ""buggy"". If Turbo Tax puts the schedules back into the Deluxe version without ratcheting the price up, I'll probably go back to them, but I'll wait until March again next year and see what the public likes best and go with that.

26073,2,H&R Block,47.3333333333333,"02 17, 2015","I bought this product because it supported Sched D (and it does) and the Turbotax (TT) Deluxe product in 2014 didn't. After using the HRB product, I wish I'd spent the extra money for the Turbotax Premier. From past experience, the TT interviews are much more complete, as is the work that the program does for you. The HRB product seems to be written for one of their tax pros who has experience with it and knows how to get through more than just the simplest of situations. I really had to hunt to manually override a lot of HRB defaults, like how to handle a federal tax free distribution, a portion of which was taxed in my state. And when I put in my social security info from the SSA-1099, HRB didn't ask about any Medicare B or D insurance premiums, so I had to remember them for my itemized deductions later (after trying desperately to find out why I wasn't being asked about them up front). I also had a lot of manual labor with HRB, handling a long term health care insurance premium, a portion of which is a federal deduction, but a different portion is tax credit in my state. With TT, you just enter the whole amount once and TT handles all the nuances of the calcllations for you. I was able to figure it all out eventually, but even at minimum wage, the time I spent on problems like that was worth more than the TT upgrade cost. But then the crowning blow was when the HRB chat lady told me there is a known issue with the HRB product, that they're ""working on"" as I write, where the product cannot handle a person that was on Obamacare at the beginning of the year and Medicare at the end. During the ""accuracy review,"" the program suggests that you see a tax professional about it and won't let you file electronically. I hope they get it fixed before the filing date.

I'm going to attempt to return it since it doesn't do what it should...allow me to file my taxes!

By the way, another reason for Obamacare/1095-A users to avoid this product is if anyone in your household is 65 or over.

After reading the reviews I decided to go with H&R Block Deluxe.  Shortly after ordering, I received an email from Turbo Tax that they were NOW aware of concerns and would let users upgrade free if they needed features dropped from the 2014 software.  Wish I had waited.  I wasn't happy with the way H & R Block software worked compared to Turbo Tax.  I could not print actual forms to check my work, only draft copies that were smaller versions and difficult to read.  I was not even given the option of itemizing my deductions versus taking standard deduction as the software only asked questions and filled in the forms.  It was even difficult to input my wife's income information as I had to figure out how to go back for the correct input screens.and I could not work with the actual forms as i could in Turbo Tax.  Also, Turbo Tax included Ohio forms for local school district taxes.  H&R did not, at least I could not find them without going to the State of Ohio and downloading poor PDF copies of the form. I understand that at least part of my problem is ignorance and unfamiliarity with the software but definitely going back to Turbo Tax next year.",I wasn't happy with the way H & R Block software worked ...
26078,2,H&R Block,47.3333333333333,"02 9, 2015","I purchased this because I, like everyone else here, was a little frustrated at the price of TurboTax in recent years. After using H&R Block software I feel that the inflated price Intuit charges is completely justified.

This is not a well polished product. Right out of the box I had troubles even installing it on Windows 8.1. You need to run the installer as Admin or in safe mode if you want to avoid an (unhelpful) error message. I purchased the disk version from Best Buy. Perhaps the download works better.

The program does not keep track of what you've visited and what you haven't like TurboTax does. Seriously? You want me to remember which of the 100+ sections I've visited? You better not miss one either, it might cost you. For example, the software assumes by default that you don't have qualifying health care coverage and taxes you appropriately. I had to look over the generated 1040 form and look at the IRS instructions to figure out why my return was almost $1,000 less than TurboTax after a single W-2 import.

Here's the bottom line:
This software will get the job done for you if you're thorough. The user interface is passable at best. Don't listen to people who say it's just as easy to use as TurboTax. That's like a delusional geek telling you Linux is just as easy to use as OS X. I'm a software engineer that uses Linux every day. It's not as easy as a Mac. It WILL take you longer to do your taxes with this software. If you have a fairly standard tax situation and value your time then spend the extra 20 bucks and get TurboTax. I certainly will be giving Intuit my business again next year.",Just as easy to use? Hardly. Certainly not as pleasant
26079,2,H&R Block,47.3333333333333,"02 9, 2015","It installed quickly and  imported TT 2013 without any problem (Win 7).  Overall interface is not as crisp as TT, more difficult to navigate (esp to get back to a previous page), search function not as robust and instruction are not as clear.  The other irritation is as you navigate thru interview it keeps suggesting you click on ""take me to"" to get further info.  Never found any button or tab so marked. These are fairly minor issues, more importantly HRB had several glitches.
 After completing draft of fed return, it showed we underpaid fed taxes by alot more than we were expecting.  After going back thru every item on return, noticed a distribution from mutual fund distribution was listed twice for an individual acct (duplicates often happen both with TT and HRB if ownership is joint but this was individual).  I had to manually delete it.
The tech support who originally respond to calls and chat sessions seem to know very little about the software.  I called twice, both times it was 40 min plus to connect, then both times was placed on hold repeatedly so rep could consult with other reps, even when I called with a very basic question.
Second glitch -  when I printed state return to file it (not e-filing state return),  the federal Sch B & C printed along with the state return.  The state has never required these IRS schedules before.  After tech support rep repeatedly placed me on hold,  rep finally said if HRB was printing those forms, they must be required by the state.  WRONG - I called state and the state does NOT require those forms be submitted ( would have added  10 unnecessary pages).
Will probably go back to TT deluxe next year, esp since Intuit claims future years TT deluxe will incl Sch C,D,&E.  Hate TTs disregard of long term customers by deleting functions, and that they took way too long to totally walk this back.  But faith in HRB is shaken by glitches.  We could have ended up incorrectly having to pay large  fed tax bill, and submitted many pages of unneeded forms to the state.

At first I liked the layout and format, and found the experience to be rather enjoyable. Did my Federal fine with little to no confusion. Then came my State Tax Returns and this is when things got fun.

My wife and I had a bit of an interesting year spanning across 3 states until finally settling in one state where I live/work and she works in another state. After filing the two state portions for both states (3rd had no state income. Whoo hoo!) , it just looked wrong. Re-did it a few times and it continued to look wrong.

I ended up using the tax instructions and tax forms for my state in question, and was able to get my tax liability rather seamlessly. I don't understand why I'm paying thirty-something dollars to file additional State returns when the result is incorrect and I still have to do them manually anyways. There is a place for these software packages, as they really are effective for those with simple returns.

I am a financial professional by trade and have done taxes at a corporate level, so I like to think I am a little more familiar than most users. I just caution people to not be afraid to double check the figures from the software. The way questions are worded can you lead you down a path where you could be owing significantly more.

It seemed to do the job--until I looked at some of the forms to verify ACCURACY.  If you live in Washington State, beware of this program.  It does not calculate the deduction for state sales tax accurately, because it includes only the 6.5% state tax and not the 3.0% city and county.  If you use the IRS.gov calculator, it includes both, which makes a significant difference.  Unfortunately, there appears to be no way to over-ride the erroneous calculation to put in the correct (i.e. IRS) number.  All this makes me wonder if there are other errors in the software.

1) Interface
-In TurboTax, you get a nice summary sheet of each ""section"" you complete. For example, TurboTax conveniently shows you which sections you've completed by showing how much income you made by Wages, Investment Income, Dividends, etc. In H&R Block, the interface shows absolutely no information, and gives no visual clues of what sections have been completed and how much you made in each section.

2) Amendments
-I messed up my state return and I cannot figure out for the life of me how to access North Carolina's D400X form. To amend my Federal return, the interface was non-intuitive and I felt like I wasn't saving much time.

I spent several hours on the Federal forms, imported data from etrade and Edward Jones, and put in rental income etc.  K-1's were very difficult because there weren't enough lines to input letter codes provided by the company.

The State form is a horrible.  It doesn't calculate an underpayment penalty saying you have to go on line and print the form yourself.  It doesn't import  tax free municipal bonds so you have to individually add them to the program so that the interest can be deducted from the income.

It took over a week to finally figure out what was happening and then only through me troubleshooting the software myself and proposing a possible cause for the bug. Once I highlighted what I thought was the cause HR Block simply said it was a known issue. They did also say that the next set of updates might fix it (3/26), but that it was not listed in the items to be updated specifically. The reason I gave more than 1 star is because if you can get the software going it is actually relatively intuitive to use. There are however also a few drawbacks with the state questionnaire in that none exist for certain forms and the software has you fill out the form directly.

It was also much more difficult to go back and change numbers and get an accurate update. Actually restarted my return 3 times.

26168,2,H&R Block,54.99,"02 7, 2015","I switched to H&R Block tax software because of the TurboTax stealth cost. But in my tax situation it was a big and costly mistake. The basic functions -- inputting W2s, 1099-DIV, 1099-MISC, 1099-INT, and Schedule A itemized deductions are clear and easy to use. If that is all you need, I would recommend the software. But I was not able to figure out how to input data from 1098-T (billed tuition expenses and scholarship -- I could not find anywhere to enter the scholarship amount, and the tuition expense input area apparently is designed only to calculate education credits) and 1099-Q (529 college savings plan distributions). This is a problem because both 1099-Q and 1098-T must be inputted correctly in order to calculate taxes due on excess 529 plan distributions. I received help online (after a 10 minute wait) to locate the necessary forms within H&R Block's software, but the forms did not solve my data input problems. I wanted and needed a walk-through questionnaire that would then populate the necessary forms. Much of the H&R Block tax software help merely directs the user to the IRS instructions. Not very helpful at all -- this isn't why I have used tax prep software the past 20 years. After spending $43 and 3.5 hours, I gave up even though my federal tax return was almost complete. I then downloaded Turbotax, paid the extra $40 for Schedule C functionality (but will receive $25 back), and completed and filed my taxes, all in less than two hours. I also found that this year, the TurboTax 1099-Q and 1098-T input is much clearer and easier to use than in years past.",Good for plain vanilla tax situations but problematic for special cases
26169,2,H&R Block,54.99,"02 6, 2015","OK. First the disclamiers:

1) I am not an accountant, but then again I have done my own taxes (personal, business,S-Corp and LLC, rentals, etc.) for the last 22 years. AND I must recommend, when you do that, pay an Accountant for an hour's worth of his time to review your returns. You may be pleasantly surprised.

2) I also purchased  TurboTax 2014 Deluxe. I got really ticked off when I realized you couldn't do Sched D and Sched E's on that like prior years. So I returned that last month and gave Intuit a one-star rating! Then I purchased H&R Block's Premier.

Low and behold, Intuit saw all the negative feedback and JUST RECENTLY came back with an apology and a free upgrade to Premier version that does all of that. Now we are almost same price as H&R Block's. Excellent.

Now here comes  the low down on H&R Block's Premier.

It readily imports from your prior year Turbotax. No worries. And it also does a good job on walking you thru like TurbTax product, similar user interfaces (though a bit cruder), but  it does the job. It also does a good job on calculating your charitable donation item valuations.

Here's the problem! Look back on your professionally prepared returns of your prior years. If you have a business or a partnership with a K-1, and you have un-reimbursed partner Expenses (UPE), it falls flat on its face! Instead of taking the deduction on Sched E and reducing your self Employment taxes, it shoves it onto form 2106, and takes the deduction on you itemized expenses. So what? This would cost me an additional $2500-$3500 in extra taxes (your results may vary).

So I called the support line and after an almost two hour wait, they opened a ticket and told me to call back. I did so 3  weeks later, same wait time. But Gee Wiz, ticket was closed. Long story short, no help, no explanation, no resolution, nada. I posted the issue on Amazon product Q&A and no one else had an answer.

The moral of this story is, if you have a simple return to do, H&R Block's software would probably do just fine and save you ten bucks over TurboTax. All the rest of you be worried, be VERY worried!","AND I must recommend, when you do that"

After using H&R Block to file my 2014 tax return I can say there are pros and cons but overall I dislike H&R Block and I think they need to improve their product if they want to keep the business the gained as a result of poor marketing on the part of Turbo Tax.  Similarly, Turbo Tax can easily gain their customers back if they handle this well.
Pros:
1) I was able to load my 2014 Turbo Tax return flawlessly
2) The product worked in that I was able to prepare and file my return
3) I believe the questions they asked resulted in a higher refund for me, although I did not actually process my return in Turbo Tax to verify this.  I base my comment on the fact that H&R Block asked a question that Turbo Tax has never asked me previously.
Cons:
1) I found the software cumbersome and not nearly as user friendly as Turbo Tax.  This may be partially because I am accustomed to Turbo Tax, but even searching common deductions in their help section found no results.
2) TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SUPPORT.  I simply wanted to know the cost and how to upgrade from Deluxe to Premium.  I could not find any information on doing this either on-line or within the program.  I even tried entering a bunch of bogus information trying to trigger it to prompt me to upgrade, but instead it said my return was successfully reviewed and ready to be filed when in fact it was clearly incomplete.  After searching every place I could think of, I tried on-line chat.  This was unsuccessful because it kept telling me I needed to enter my address but it didn't give me a space to enter my address.  As a last resort I called their help line.  I waited 33 minutes for a representative who could not tell me how to upgrade the deluxe version to the premium version.  She had to transfer me to another department and now 30 more minutes later I am still on hold.  I'll admit, I hate how Turbo Tax constantly prompts you to upgrade, but at least they give you the option!
I think the war between Turbo Tax and H&R Block is a fascinating marketing study and will probably be used as an example for years to come.

I used it to prepare my elderly father-in-law's very simple return using all manual inputs and it worked fine. In fact I liked some of the layout and quality of explanations better than Turbo Tax. I then tried it for my somewhat more complicated return and immediately ran into problems trying to automatically import financial information from my bank and investment companies (e.g., 1099-INT, dividends, etc). The software would not make any connection regardless of the institution that I tried. I contacted H&R Block tech support for help via chatline. After about a 15 minute wait, a tech support person came on line and said she was researching the issue based on the information I had submitted. Several minutes passed, and I asked if she was still there. She said yes, that she was still researching the issue. Another 10 minutes went by with no feedback so I typed another prompt. The tech support person then asked me what version of the software I was using (which was part of the information I had supplied to initiate the chat in the first place). I responded. Then after several more minutes, the recommended response was to disable my firewalls and virus protection to run the software. Against my better judgment I did that and received the same error. I then reinstated my firewalls and virus protection, went back to Amazon, and purchased Turbo Tax, which had remedied (at least for this year) the issues that caused the earlier negative reviews.

As a result, I had to go see an H&R Block CPA, which is what I was trying to avoid by purchasing this software in the first place.

First:  I am a partner in a partnership.  I have unreimbursed business expenses on the K-1 I received.  They should be transferred to Sked E as a reduction in partnership income, instead it transfers to Sked A which makes the expenses only deductible if they are over 2% of adjusted gross.  No way to change this other than do an override which then makes the return ineligible for electronic filing.  Others have reported this and said after long times on the phone with H&R they got no help to resolve this.  Never had this problem in the past with Turbo.

Second:  I am entitled to a refund which I applied to 2015 estimated.  Instead of taking the whole refund and applying it to the 4/15 first estimated payment, the program deducts the refund from the entire 2015 estimated payments then divides the remainder by 4 which means it tells me to pay an amount on 4/15 which I don't have to pay.

Third:  Sold stock and had $35 withheld.  This was reported to me on 1099-B box 4.  H&R only allows entries for boxes 1, 2 & 3.  No place to report amounts in box 4.

2. It calculated estimated taxes I must pay for State, but not Federal and there's no mechanism to correct that. There's a ""plan"" tab where it asks you what your income and estimated taxes will be for 2015 - it has all that info and should be estimating from last year's numbers. Customer support was useless and simply provided the IRS phone number. Pay attention or you'll get burned on that if you have to make estimated payments.

My mistake, but I doubt I would have done it any other way.  Intuit's business practices have become so suspect and disturbing, that after years of continuous use of both Turbotax and Quickbooks, I am finished.  But enough about them.  H&R Block have miles to go before delivering a top notch product.  My return is somewhat complex, so folks with simpler returns probably had better luck.  But the stumbling blocks are everywhere:  it let me enter a SEP IRA deduction without warning it was over the IRS limits.  It showed an amount on my return that I could not change, and when I tried to override, I received a warning that the amount was carried forward from another form.  But that form did not exist.  It has a myriad of annoying little worksheets that you have to close repeatedly if you want to look at a clean return.  You can't open two forms at once.  It does not carry a refund amount directly to the bank info refund line, so when the refund amount changes, the discrepancy is flagged as an error.  You can't see the refund/amount owed field when working in forms.  There are spots where you must manually check a box to have the amount carried forward to another form.  Shouldn't the program know which numbers to carry forward??? I also wish it had carried my 5-year history forward from TurboTax, but H&R doesn't even offer a 5-year history, which I find incredibly useful.  For the record, I am a finance professional.  Doing taxes should not take this long, but slogging through this program was drudgery.  The icing on the cake was when I ran the ""accuracy review"", and was advised that my ""Farm Rental Income and Expenses"" form was incomplete.  I don't have a farm.  Nor am I contemplating getting one.  But I still have not successfully deleted this form.  The program asks if I want to delete it, I check yes, then have to run through the entire cycle of screens again, until I get another error message telling me the form is incomplete.  My head is about to explode.  I will be filing taxes uncertain of whether the forms are accurate, because I just don't have the faith that my transactions were recorded directly.

26279,2,H&R Block,27.9333333333333,"03 22, 2015","When Intuit disabled handling investments in Turbo Tax Deluxe (which I've used for years), I thought I would give H&R Block a try. In the end H&R just had too many problems -- I gave up and bought Turbo Tax Premier and re-did my taxes.  It will have been more than worth the money to go back to Turbo Tax because it worked so much better for my complicated tax situation.  By the way, I found a good price for TT on bizrate - search for ""Turbo Tax Premier 2014 federal state"".

I didn't really expect H&R Block to out-shine TT because TT sells so much more and presumably can afford to hire more and better software programmers.  But the limitations of H&R Block were insurmountable in my (complicated) tax situation.  What finally pushed me over the edge and back to TT was that depreciation accounts associated with a rental house were not correctly imported from last years TurboTax return.  The accounts were duplicated in the federal return and none appeared in the California state return (maybe the dups were mis-placed state accounts?)  Anyway,  I was not about to manually re-enter (and re-figure-out) all the depreciation accounts for California.  Also H&R doesn't seem to support MACRS and other obsolete depreciation methods which the Calif. accounts required (California required using them when the assets were placed in service years ago, and depreciation methods generally can not be changed later).

There are a few other annoyances, which add up to a significant burden.  For example, you can ""add supporting details"" to input fields, just like in Turbo Tax; but there is no practical way to view them later.  H&R does not remember which ""supporting details"" go with a given input field.  There does exist a rightclick->View Supporting Details function, but it simply displays a list of *every* supporting-details sheet you ever entered anywhere in the return, identified only by the IRS form & line number the field applies to (which is useless unless you know how the step-by-step interview questions map to IRS forms).  Another nit is that H&R does not have the ""shrink to fit"" feature for text fields.  Among other things, this causes security descriptions on imported 1099-Bs to be truncated, so it is sometimes difficult to identify or distinguish trades (e.g. the Call option ""AAPL 11/22/2014 120.00 C"" becomes something like ""AAPL 11/22/20 12"").  And imported 1099-Bs from multiple brokers are lumped together in one big list, rather than being accessed per-source (that is, per-broker); this makes it difficult to check totals against paper statements.  Also H&R did not recognize 1256 contracts when importing from Schwab.

I realize this is a harsh review.  My taxes are complicated, so this was an ""acid test"" of sorts.  And it was my first time using H&R so I was not familiar with the software.  I think  H&R Block would be perfectly fine for simple returns which do not include depreciation, 1099-Bs from multiple brokers (unless only a few transactions), stock short sales, written-option transactions, or the need to use the ""supporting details"" feature.","Couldn't correctly import last year from TurboTax, plus many annoyances"

Installation was fine, as was importing last year's return. However, the specifics of our tax return include a minister's housing allowance, which can throw a wrench in the works. This software doesn't know how to deal with it properly, and won't let me efile the return at all - the instructions insist that we're required to file on paper, with additional documentation that is not necessary in our situation and that we've never had to deal with in 8+ years of ministry!

26295,2,H&R Block,27.9333333333333,"03 11, 2015","After using TurboTax for many years and learning that Intuit decided to gouge us this year, I decided I would try H&R after reading good reviews here. I have stocks to deal with so I picked up Deluxe with state option.

The install and import from TurboTax went well. H&R follows a similar but less intrusive and annoying interview process than TurboTax. They make it easy to get to help and learn relevant information related to the current topic. H&R also has a smoother interface between the actual forms and interview process as well as an easier way to navigate to the various interview processes.

Importing data from employers and brokerage was easy but a bit confusing as they also have last years imported entries as well. I finally get to my first real issue and that was validating my 1099-B's. They have one check box for Box 2 'Type of gain or loss', well box 2 on a 1099-B is actually 2 check boxes, one for Long-term and one for Short-term. Being a software developer I understand that you really don't need 2 check boxes to indicate whether this is a long or short term gain but H&R does not say either way, it's just not possible to know when to check this box.

So I called support on a Saturday morning and after a bit of tag with a computer voice I was quite surprised to be talking to a real person. The surprise quickly ended as the person on the other end had little knowledge of the product and really could not understand the issue at hand. After 20 minutes of somewhat unprofessional support I decided I had enough and would make a guess as to whether item 2 should be checked or not, look at the forms and then determine if checked is long or checked is short.

After figuring out the 1099-B issue I finished up the federal with no other glitches. Now on to state, I was prompted to download my state package, which is Indiana. I live on the border with Kentucky and actually work out of state where Louisville has a local tax that all workers must pay.

All is going well with the state, then we come to some schedules that need dollar amounts calculated. The only thing that H&R does is say to follow the directions to calculate. They provide no direction so I next spend 30 minutes getting specific directions for this calculation by downloading the directions from Indiana's web site. I'm not pleased to have to do this as this is a big reason for buying software.

After moving on I then note that my refund calculated so far looks rather high and after doing some math I determine that H&R has incorrectly summed locality withholdings, it has included the Kentucky portion with my Indiana. It's 10PM on a Tuesday night and the house is quiet so I decided to try the online chat, after 1 hour of, 'we are busy'  and 'we will be with you in a moment' I have someone on the other end. After telling me to try so many things that I knew was just wrong they finally told me how I could override the actual W-2 value that was pulled into the state form. This process took 49 minutes and was the most unprofessional interaction I have ever had with any customer service, I will say that this person should be fired.

I didn't note while on the chat that the software tells you when you override a field that you cannot efile. No big deal it will save me the additional $19 efile charge. I get to the final accuracy check and I am told my W-2 locality entry does not have a state marked and that I need to go back to the federal section under W-2 and fix this. I know the issue is related to the out of state local tax entry but after 30 minutes of trying I am unable to resolve by myself.

This is where I am right now I think I will just cut my losses and do my state by hand, it will probably be quicker and less painful than dealing with the horrible support that H&R has provided.",Lesson Learned....You Get What You Pay For?

Lots of people say they had no problem downloading previous Turbo Tax info. Unfortunately, that's not my experience. I spent about an hour on the phone with a lady from H&R Block. She knew NOTHING about Macs and despite putting me on hold 4-5 times (I assume asking someone else what she should try next) we couldn't resolve the problem. She said that she'd escalate my problem to Tier Two, and someone would call me within 3 days.

Of course, that didn't happen. I called again a week later. That lady couldn't help me either, but she gave me the direct number to call Tier Two. I called the number and after waiting through 45 minutes of a recording touting H&R Block services, I hung up. They could at least provide an estimate of the waiting time. Other companies can do it -- why not H&R Block?

I'm still hoping my issue is an anomaly, and that on my next call the problem will be resolved. Of course, I'm also hoping for world peace, and that Scotland Yard will leave Anna and Bates alone, and that the Kansas City Royals WILL win the World Series next October. I wonder which of those pitiful wishes has the best chance of becoming a reality.

And just in case H&R Block actually cares about customer service, and not just pretends to, and has someone monitoring these reviews....my case id is RES 35306191. Perhaps someone with the ability to resolve this problem could contact me. Or even someone with the authority to issue a full refund.

2. Process was pretty easy, but I felt like I was missing something as I navigated through the question wizard
3. Submitted electronically (additional fees) and all was good.

Then the US Postal Office delivered a piece of tax forms two weeks late, so I had to go back into the software and fill out a 1040x (Federal) and 540x (State). I got stuck along the way so I attempted to call Support for help.

1. The number provided in the software sent me to 1.800 472 5625, option 2 for Online Support. After waiting 20+ minutes the person said they couldn't help me and said I needed to talk to Software Support. I was given a case number.
2. After another twenty to thirty minute hold, Software support wanted to feed me a knowledgebase article, which didn't answer my question. When it didn't work they said I need to talk to a Tax Advisor and attempted to transfer me. And I got a new case number. Why? I have no idea.
3. I held for another 20+ minutes and did not get a Tax Advisor but the Customer Retention department. Really? I get yet a THIRD case number and am transferred back to Online Support.
4. I ask for a supervisor. . .after yet my FOURTH 20+ minute hold. The supervisor was the first to actually ""troubleshoot"" my issue and ask me questions even though she was the Online Support supervisor and not the Software Support supervisor. We resolved my issue up to that point and I received my FOURTH case number.

Next day I received one survey for four cases. Survey didn't tell me which case it related to, so I left feedback for all the cases.

I had to call again, but this time I had the direct number for Software Support: 1.888 482 9288
5. First person could not help me after waiting nearly thirty minutes.
Do they not staff for peak seasons there?!?
6. I was transferred again. Held again. Got someone who couldn't help me again. Received my FIFTH case number between all these interactions.
7. Finally got to someone who gave me yet ANOTHER case number and said my issue would be escalated and I'd be contacted within 2-3 days.

Six Days later, I missed the call from Support and called back on the number they provided: 1.866 606 3400
8. Sat on hold for 62 minutes this morning = no answer, I had to drop off to actually do my own job and attend a meeting.
9. Sat on hold again for 106 minutes = no answer, I had to drop off again.
10. I received an email survey as if my case is closed, when nothing has been resolved. What?!?
11. I'm still unresolved in my issue.

Also every time I talk to someone new I have to completely repeat myself and the issue experienced. Must be why I get a new case number each time because they don't share information.

First, there was the infamous crash with importing last year's TurboTax returns on XP.  After they finally fixed the issue I was able to almost complete my tax return.  In the end, there was another bug with the form required to file the Affordable Health Care Act.  It was simply giving me an error with little explanation.  I completed the form three times exactly as I received it from the government, and I was still getting this error, which prevents me from filing my return.

I contacted H&R regarding this using their ""chat window"" (I had to wait over an hour to get a representative).  After explaining my problem she told me that there was a patch coming out on March 12 that would fix the problem.  That's March 12.  One month before taxes are due.

I don't know if the software development division of H&R Block has a Quality Assurance department, or what they do all day.  Any decent QA department would finds the bugs in the software BEFORE it is released, especially obvious ones like the ones I've encountered so far.

The program did not make me answer the question (and did not throw up an error or double check even the question went unanswered ) So the box wasn't checked  ""yes"" where it needed to be and I didn't notice right away and I filed that one. .

The question was relatively simple (where do I enter a non standard deduction) and the ""tax advisor"" helping me either (a) did not understand my question or (b) was not knowledgable enough to answer right away.  I told him which part of the tax code to refer to and still he was unable to tell me where to enter the information.

Everything seemed to be going well when I tried using H&R Block Deluxe - it converted my data from 2013 on my new iMac just fine, and I was making my way through everything fairly easily.  As a general matter, I like the presentation of TurboTax a bit better than H&R Block - it summarizes your income and deductions at various points in the program as you navigate through it, and compares your current information with past years.  H&R Block doesn't seem to have any those extra features, which are really not necessary, but kind of nice.  H&R Block Deluxe is straightforward and seems to have everything I would have needed to file my tax return.  Unfortunately, while I was entering my charitable deductions, I received an unexpected error, the program quit, and I lost about 2 hours of information for my charitable deductions.  I really, really wanted this software to work, but I can't risk re-entering my information.

I took this as an opportunity to compare TT, H&R and TaxACT using the same information.  Everything was going fine until it came to my 2106, where we had business usage of two cars to record.  H&R Block had a calculation error with one of the two vehicles!  All the input numbers were correct, and identical between all three pieces of software; H&R Block just failed to get the right percentage when dividing business usage by total usage for one of the two vehicles.

This was my first time using this software. In the past, using Turbo Tax, I would get a 1099-Q worksheet that walked me through each step of the process. With this software, it basically summarizes the IRS rules for you, which I interpreted as saying that these distributions aren't taxable unless used for something other than tuition. If you select No, that the amounts received were not taxable since used for tuition, you then get no option to input the amounts as part of your return.

This year I had a question about the Minnesota Property Tax Return so I chatted with H&R Block support.  Their person basically said ""I don't know anything about taxes and I don't know how our software works.""  {laugh} That seems like pretty useless support.

It's a real toss up as to whether it is better to do your taxes by hand or to use a piece of software like this.  If you do your taxes by hand you will have a much better understanding of what you are filing (but it will still be confusing at points).  If you use the software it is ""easier"" as long as you just blindly click ""next"" and pray the software is doing it right (it missed one thing which I had to go back and manually figure out what was wrong and that made a $1000 difference on my return).

Note: this is all from the point of view of a person who is filing for income from both a normal job and a Schedule C for their own business.

To be fair, I think the tax software has an almost impossible job and 99% of the fault is with the government for making tax code so complex that only the wealthy (who can afford a tax attorney and accountant to optimize their taxes) can reasonably deal with filing taxes or the very low end of the income scale that has virtually nothing to report and can just do the ""EZ"" version.",Poor but mostly the fault of Complex tax law

I'm not advocating using a particular software, I just want you as a user to be aware of what you agree to when you use this software. Some clauses that alarmed me, directly from their privacy policy:

""We may also use your information, as permitted by law, to service and report on your account and to offer you relevant information, products, or services. These activities may be performed by use or a service provider acting on our behalf.""

-So they can give out my information to other parties to... provide services. Seeing as that's associated with offering me 'relevant products' I'd rather not let them gather my information to give to people to sell me things.

""We treat the data of everyone who comes to our websites in accordance with this Privacy Notice, whatever their ""do not track"" setting. While we do not respond to web browser ""do not track"" signals, we give you choices about receiving promotional offers from us or third-parties.""

-This is a fancy way of saying that they do not care about what options you've elected in your browser (your preferences), they are only beholden to their Privacy Notice (completely dictated by them).

""We keep your information for as long as needed or as required by law""

-So, forever. H&R is a business, businesses always need to sell services. The Privacy Notice authorizes them to use your information to sell services. They will always need your information.

""We maintain appropriate safeguards to protect your information.""

-This is the extent they are willing to give you in their Privacy Notice. Given the sensitivity of the information involved and the amount of data they collect (and send to third parties), good luck keeping it secure. To be fair, I didn't really have hope that they would in the first place - how many other data breaches happen every month - I was just looking for something more than ""we secure your data... appropriately.""

H&R Block does have a third party reviewing their privacy policy (TRUSTe - [...], which looks like it ensures they are in compliance with their own policy.

I had an issue with my state return. It wasn't being excepted for some reason so I made an appointment with the nearest H&R Block office to see if they could figure it out. There software was VERY vague as to what the problem was. It had something to do with the disability tax for NYC. It states that what I selected was incorrect but according to the information from the software, I was supposed to select it. When I got there, they new what was wrong but wanted to charge me again to fix it. I walked out very unhappy. In the next 2 days it was finally excepted without me doing anything. I switched to this software because of what I was hearing from Turbo Tax upping their filing price and the user not knowing it till they were ready to file.

For some reason it couldn't calculate the correct gross income in my local state. My wife works in another state, so we had two state taxes to file, but for some reason, it almost doubled the amount of taxes that needed to be shown. And when I manually updated to the correct amount, it wouldn't let me e-file! I gave up and sucked up the purchase of Turbo tax, which I completed in ten mins and filed without an issue.

If I buy the Deluxe version (which I did) I expect that it will cover my federal and state e-files along with helping me do the tax paperwork. The latter part was fine. Charging me $19.95 to e-file my state AFTER I've already bought the $29.95 Deluxe version is not. It's especially laughable seeing as how in my state you can e-file for free via the comptrollers office, or you can just mail it in like I did last year. Either way get your stuff together H&R.

26376,2,H&R Block,34.6,"02 14, 2015","OK, so switching from TurboTax saves you maybe $30. Is it worth it? This software caused two problems I have never had with TT.

1. It goes through the same style interview as TT - but does not show amounts you put in last year - and gets to the end where you can fill in where to send your refund. I duly type in account information and the  error check feature insists that I have to fill in the same amount for refund as the program calculates. Since the program fills that in for me I don't see the problem. No amount I fill in makes it happy. Call for help. They tell me to save another copy and send to them for checking. By simply saving under a different filename the program now gives me a different refund amount! This turned into a 2 hour comedy of errors with the program and customer support. In the end it accepted a number to refund me but I still have no idea if it is correct... Not particularly confidence inspiring.
2. Then I efile the return and two hours later realize the program never asked me about IRA contributions. Great, so now I have to file an amendment for the first time ever. Had the program shown a comparison with prior year amounts this omission would have been obvious, but it didn't.

I bailed on Turbo Tax this year because I heard the horror stories of the price increase and decreased functionality.  A couple annoying things with the H&R Block software: One, I could not choose when to pay my state the taxes I owe nor do it electronically (I could do this with Turbo Tax).  So now I have to print 11 forms and write a check and mail it to the state.  (It did only cost $19.99 to state file.) Second, the number of scenarios and possible deductions seems much more limited here than with Turbo Tax (especially with regard to independent contracting/self-employment expenses). They are also not explained in layman's terms. Third, and maybe most importantly, I'm not convinced that it handled my state return properly.  I live in a state with complicated tax laws and this year I ended up owing them 4x as much as I usually do (nothing much had changed from 2013 to explain this increase). In fact, I'm not confident I got the biggest refund I could have on the federal return either. :-(  The pluses?

If in the past you have use H&R Block's online tax software, it is IMPOSSIBLE to import that data into the standalone program. That was enormously frustrating. I contacted their support people after trying to find a way for a couple hours, and that's what I was told.

Overall, the program does a moderately OK job. But just like the web version, navigating around is a royal pain. One would think that a ""back"" button would do exactly that - take you back ONE SCREEN. But nope! It takes you ""back"" to the start of the whole section where you're working. In other words, if you enter some data on one screen, and then click ""next"" to go to the next screen, and realize you made a mistake, good luck. You're kicked back to the beginning of the whole section.

Honestly, the reason I elected to purchase the software this year instead of doing my taxes on H&R's web site was in the hopes of avoiding this hassle. I've sent this criticism to them before but it's obviously fallen on deaf ears.

I don't like how their deductions breezes past quickly too. I knew I had two specific items to enter - mileage and uniform purchases, but had to go back at the end and poke around to find them. That was annoying, and is easy to miss.","Works OK, could be a ton better"

Everything goes smoothly, but the software is unusable as-is.  You can manage to make it through a few of the steps, but simply by guessing the right button to click. I WAS successful in importing last years TurboTax return, but eventually I reached a point that I couldn't make it go to the next step without clear buttons.

Amazon does not offer refunds for downloaded software (boo), so I just spent the last 1 1/2 hours with H&R Block software support.  I spoke to a very sweet and helpful agent who kindly walked me through the uninstall and reinstall process. She eventually provided me a link for a direct download from H&R Block, but that proved ineffective as well.  Instead of escalating the issue, I asked the agent if she had the authority to issue refunds. With some trepidation she did grant me the authorization for a refund and gave me the address to submit my order confirmation.  I should see a check in a few weeks.

I was hoping to be a new convert to H&R this year after decades of being a TurboTax user. I'm really sorry this didn't work for me.

""Publicly traded partnerships (PTPs) are subject to special rules that are beyond the scope of the program this year. You may need to revise the entries on your return to reflect these special rules.""

26419,2,H&R Block,40.95,"03 23, 2015","I started using H&R Block years ago mostly out of a desire to support competition in the market for tax software. Back then my tax needs were much simpler and really for a largely standard 1040, I could have used almost any software and it would have served me well.

Times have changed. I now have to contend with foreign assets and schedule K-1s and it's clear that H&R Block has been rather complacent in updating this software. Today I cannot give it a passing grade for my needs and only allow for two to three stars if your needs are simple. Making matters worse, I sprang for the Premium edition this year thinking it would help me with the more complex items in my return, and it has failed.

The software does not support submission of form 8938 if you have more than 2 foreign assets to report. I could understand this as a one-time miscue in a year that the IRS dropped a bomb with little notice, but tax advisors should have been well aware of this reporting requirement a decade ago. I'll grant that it is probably a fraction of US filers at large that need to post more than 2 assets, but I understand competitive packages such as TaxACT and TurboTax both support continuation pages on the 8938. If you search the Internet for help on this issue, H&R Block doesn't have a fix yet and it appears you must inelegantly send a manual paper submission to the IRS, defeating one of the main reasons for buying software like this in the first place.

The Schedule K-1 support is also lacking. While there is a section for the form, it provides little guidance on the more complex items like lines where the K-1 has STMT and you have to look at supplementary documentation to determine the entry.

Ultimately I cannot recommend this software for anyone with more complex returns.

I gave up waiting, re-keyed the parts of the interview that I think the program was screwing up the handling of, and went ahead and filed.

FEATURES
I enjoy being able to right-click an see how either an interview question or a field on a form links to other parts of the return.  More often than not, there is no information available when clicking to this option.  Very frustrating when trying to track calculations or learn something about the forms/code/rules.
Related, context-sensitive help lacks linkage to context-specific tax rules--just refers to general pubs.

What a joke that I can file federal (relatively complicated) returns electronically at no extra charge, but the company wants to charge me $19+ to file the relatively calculation-free State return.

CUSTOMER SUPPORT
Support technicians I spoke with on the phone--and one via online chat--were truly concerned and responsive, but were as puzzled as I was when they reproduced my problem on copy of my return I had uploaded to them and unable to resolve, elevating my problem report to the next level.

I have done my taxes for years on excel spreadsheets I have set up for the purpose, going through and changing formulas annually to reflect changes I tax code/rules/values. I thought that I would try one of the well-rated products to give myself a break, and to (later) compare my own calculations to as a baseline for possible future reliance on my spreadsheets.

Mistake.

I spent too much time on hold (40 minute wait time initially before hanging up.  40 mins another time before contact and another hour on phone (most of it on hold) with tech trying to look things up. another 30+ mins waiting for agent on chat. and ditto the wait and call times when contacting tier II.

As a courtesy, the agents ask when is a good time for return calls to be made (for tier II and then tier III to get back to me.  I told them ""now"" or late in evening (when I am free).  When tier II called back, it was middle of afternoon, leaving msg.  so I of course had to get on hold again when I got home and could call back. (Why ask when is a good time to call back, and create an expectations gap?)

The problem:
donating a vehicle as one of 8 non-cash charitable donations.  Following the interview, which asks for clothing etc. first, the vehicle ended up as item ""f""\ which placed it on the second copy of the form along with two others.  Tier III is charged with figuring out why this may have contributed to a rejection of the return for E-filing and I may learn someday, but my, tier I and tier II attempts to follow steps on the rejection report to regenerate the respective form resulted in identical rejection codes. deleting and re-keying the vehicle donation did not address it. I thought to try and get the vehicle on to the FIRST copy of the form, so I deleted enough contributions so that I only had 3 clothing-based ones, THEN skipped ahead in the interview to key in a vehicle (which became donation ""d"", on the first copy of the form) before keying in the other clothing and then other donations in sequence after that.
That worked, and the e-file was then accepted.

I had speculated with tier II that trying to get the vehicle onto the first form might be a workaround.
Do you think HRBlock might pay me a the consulting fee for pointing them toward where the bug in their software is?
I might be happy with a phone call back from tier III someday, but I think I will have to settle for simply asking for my money back.

I was faced with the choice of spending about $200 for 2 versions of TurboTax (Business and Personal) in order to do my taxes this year or pay $65 to get H&R's ONE program that can do both of my returns.
My first impression of using H&R's software is not that great.  The interface isn't as polished as it's more expensive competition. H&R's software doesn't seem to be as complete when asking about my company's financial/tax situation.  Going back to edit numbers requires too many clicks.
I saved about $140 in software, but I have a feeling that it's going to take me longer to get my 2 tax returns done this year.

It appears to function completely fine and it probably works for tons of people, but after 3 years of using TurboTax, I am more used to Turbotax and I will probably just have to cough up a little more money to do my taxes next year.","Cheap, but not as good as it's more expensive competition"

This was my first year using H&R Block; I have always used TurboTax previously.  The program is more difficult to get around in, but eventually I got the hang of it.  The real problems I had were:
1) Support is generally not very good.  I had to contact them several times and often got incorrect information.  For example, one support person kept trying to tell me that non-residents did not have to file a tax return in Hawaii, which is totally False.
2) The state business programs are not very flexible; this is the main reason I bought this and it turns out I had to do all my business state forms manually because they didn't support the allocation of income as I needed to do it.
3) For personal taxes I need to file Idaho and Hawaii non-resident forms.  Hawaii is not supported at all for non-resident, so that is a bust.  Idaho is supported but isn't calculating correctly given my prior year Net Operating Losses.  I am now debating whether to buy TurboTax personal or whether to do my state taxes manually.

26484,2,H&R Block,40.95,"03 13, 2015","I have used many dozens of software programs, from office products to engineering applications to software development tools. I'd be hard pressed to think of one that I dislike more than this one. The user interface is remarkably poorly designed for a mature product such as this. I was constantly confused by its organization and annoyed by its lack of obviously necessary features.

I am a former TurboTax user who was satisfied with the product but not with its publisher Intuit due to their anti-consumer policies, e.g. lobbying to prevent the simplification of tax forms so that tax software would be less necessary, and crippling their Quicken products after 3 years of use. So I decided to try H&R block. I really *wanted* to like this software, but to my disappointment this is what I found:

1. Can't use mouse wheel to scroll a form until first clicking on an editable field (clicking elsewhere on the page does not permit scrolling). If you switch to another windows program and then back to H&R Block, you must again find an editable field to click on in order to scroll.

2. When some forms are opened, the focus is initially on drop-down box. If one tries to scroll, then the value of the drop-down changes, possibly without the user even noticing. Compounding this issues -- there is no undo feature, so even if you realize that you changed the value, you might not know what the old value was.

3.  After entering a list for a value box, that list cannot be directly edited again by clicking on the same value box. The only option is to right-click and select Open Itemized List which presents a menu of all lists that you have created on all forms. The current list item (the one that brought you here) isn't selected by default, so it is necessary to search though the list of list names to find the one you want. In addition, some list names default to a common name (such as when there are multiple copies of a form), so you can have many lists shown with the same name and no way to find the one you want other than by trial and error. Adding an ""Edit this list"" option to the context menu would greatly improve usability.

4. When viewing the Forms window (which inexplicably opens a different window, even though you can also edit the form in the normal Interview-style window), that window is modal and therefore nothing in the main window, e.g. the Save button, can be clicked.

5. Some changes are irreversible and without occur warning, e.g. attempting to temporarily select the ""Claim the home office safe harbor deduction"" on Form 8829 will delete all entries and lists that become irrelevant when that box is checked. Clearing that checkbox does not restore the deleted values and lists.

6. Colors: It seems to have been designed primary for people who are color blind as the forms are displayed with no colors. Values that are calculated are shown as black text on dark grey backgrounds which I found difficult to read. Tentative values are shown with an easily unnoticed asterisk (rather than an alternate color), and the values derived from the tentative value are not marked at all (unlike Turbo Tax which clearly colors red all tentative values and the values derived from them).

7. If the Windows toolbar is located on the left side of the screen, then HR Block windows repeatedly open under the toolbar (partially or totally obscured), even after they have been moved, closed and re-opened.

8. Form 1095-A: Box 2: The field is not large enough to hold the required value for a CA Health Exchange policy number.

9. Form 1095-A Interview: There is a single box provided for each person for ""Start Date/End Date"". The box accepts only a single date.

10. When there are multiple copies of forms, e.g. several 1099-INT forms, and you try to trace a value to one of those forms using the Jump To Related feature, you are presented with a list of items designated ""Copy 1"", ""Copy 2"", etc. First, the program should simply take you to the correct copy. Secondly, if it really had to give you a list of options, they should be more descriptive (such as include the Payee name) so that it does not require a trial and error process to find the form that you want.

11. Importing from TurboTax: Basic information, e.g. name, address, capital loss carryover, imported correctly. Other items, e.g. Section 179 carryover, Schedule C loss carryover, and state estimated tax payments, were not imported. Worst of all "" the Federal estimated tax payments were populated with the values of the state estimated tax payments! OMG! Really? Check your previous year's return carefully for carryovers and prior payment values.

12. PDF Generation: Program crashed while creating a PDF file (although the file was created). Unfortunately the PDFs have no table of contents as they do with TurboTax, a feature that I find very useful.

13. If you are editing a form, the only way to open a new form (other than those available in the Recently Used window) is to close the form and return to the Interview window where you can once again select Forms, open the desired form, and [sigh] once again open the Recently Used window. Then you can once again resize and reposition both of those windows. Yes, this procedure is required every time you open a new form. As I said in the title, a shockingly poor user interface.

I did find one redeeming feature in H&R Block -- the Recent Forms List. This is very useful for bouncing back and forth between forms, and I prefer this to TurboTax's tabbed window approach.  It would be better if it were integrated as a panel in the main window instead of a separate window which must be re-opened and resized/repositioned every time the Forms window is opened.

I gave H&R block two stars rather than one because it ultimately allowed me to enter my data and, as far as I can tell, performed the calculations correctly.

I also evaluated TaxAct and found the user interface to be vastly superior to H&R Block's. See my review here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FWT0UA2UBEJ8/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S6SNK8W

Minuses: would not import last year's TT return, apparently will not import Quickbooks although I have one more return to do and may try again, printing as mentioned above.  Calculations of tax on estate distributions (in excess of DNI) were apparently not correct, or at least confusing.

Additionally, if you are completing Form 940 for Unemployment taxes and have tax due in excess of $500, the wizard will prompt you to calculate the quarterly liability. The problem is it suggests you multiply by the tax rate of .008 and the 2014 FUTA rate is .006.",Fairly easy to Use but Has a Few Irksome Quirks

Well, not really thrilled about this first time user experience with such. It is simple to use, but the problem is that if you go back to change things, the software isn't able to keep up with these changes and this transforms with the final exam to then present you with both a difference in the return amount, always lower than before and again in return if you simply do the same thing without any further changes, else you then find verifications that may or may not mean something (which is it?). I got so frustrated with the end results after making a couple of modifications and simply going through each step again only to find the return amount grew less and less. I knew something was amiss when upon looking to submit the state return, suddenly the $20 fee was then $34.99...so I started at the beginning from federal to state again, no change in the end results and presented with the $20 fee instead of the $34.99 fee.

I'm sorry, while I really hoped TurboTax would have stayed similar to their reputation over the years, I find H&R Block software cheaper, but more goofy and unreliable. I literally did have to delete one return's file to start over after it seemed that the entire process wrought different questions each time I simply wanted to step through for review and watch the return amount continue to revert as well. This is a seriously buggy program, at least in my experience this year for the first time.

I hope both get their thing together regarding 2015 tax season, else I may actually revert to doing it manually as I used too!! My returns are not difficult, so I can't understand why this software opted to make changes without my doing so, or get confused with the return amount otherwise. It didn't make me feel confident in the end results being finally submitted.

Lastly, I'd have opted to TurboTax again and again had not for the ignorance of their decision makers to devalue their software after years of no complaints. What you paid for is what you got. Well, I must admit that opting to H&R Block helped me realize that there was issue with how TurboTax calculated deductions and not favorable in the past. The rules are interpreted differently between software apps, so beware and still consider being on top of the rules that apply to your deductions rather than what ANY software determines. H&R was basically it was this or that and got confused. TurboTax as in the past I learned opted to use state/local sales tax over income tax as a deduction in the past and turned out to be incorrect or H&R's interpretation with a flawed import from TurboTax was unable to figure it out right at all.

Caveat Emptor...taxes aren't simply letting software do what you think it should, even if you have a simple return...

Tempted by a nice sale price from Amazon, and irritated by some of the patently greedy decisions Intuit has tried to foist on its customers, I decided to give H&R Block another chance this year.  Unfortunately, this software wasn't up to the task, the money I spent on it is down the drain, and I'm back to TT.

At two points during data entry (once while entering some information from a Shchedule K-1, and once while preparing Form 1116) the program told me ""Sorry, your situation is too complex for the program to handle.  Please read the IRS instructions, fill out the relevant form manually, and then come back to the interview.  And, by the way, be careful, because some of the entries we've already made on other forms may need to be adjusted.""

Really?  I give them points for being honest and not just generating a potentially erroneous return, but being asked to read IRS publications and fill forms in manually is not what I expect from tax preparation software.  Maybe I just was just unlucky and found the only two (admittedly somewhat uncommon) situations where this will happen, or maybe not....I didn't spend time looking for other situations, if any, where I'd have the same result.  In any case, I went back to TT, which handled my two special situations without blinking an eye (even apologizing for having to ask me a bunch of additional questions).

The program is certainly not all bad.  The user interface is clean and makes it easy to find what you're looking for, and the interview process is generally straightforward and easy to follow. The ""help"" system is actually quite good...there are typically some well-chosen FAQs on each interview page, and the general help is easy to read and, well, more helpful than you'll find in TT.  The integrated system for valuing and reporting charitable donations of property is nicely done, and much more convenient than Intuit's approach of entering items on a separate (rather clunky) website and then importing the results.  The simple and everyday inputs that most people will have, and even common investment situations (interest, dividends, security sales) appear to be handled appropriately.  If that's all you need, then H&R Block is probably up to the job.

I've given the software two stars.

I had to create an account then find the right area and fill out a form with my name, address, phone number, etc. just to connect, then was eventually told to go to a web site to get the amount the program wanted.  This should have been included in the instructions and took almost an hour just to get this figured out.  I also had to go through the same extensive steps to chat again today because there is apparently no 1040EZ or 1040A in the package.  The support informed me the only form in the program is the general form 1040.  WHAT???

The forms print okay, but the dollar amount fields print so poorly and faintly that you can't read them clearly.  That would likely trigger a tax audit if you filed them that way with the IRS.  Hence you have to go over the printed forms and write all the numbers in by hand with a pen.

1. The tax preparation software encourages the user to let the program guide you through the process of gathering your material and filling out the return.  This year the program got me into trouble because it abbreviated and consequently omitted an important form from my return.  More specifically, my original tax preparation was missing Form 8853. Instead of lengthy questions covering all possible situations, H&R Block just presents a list of 18 forms and asks whether one has to prepare any of them.  One of those forms was what H&R Block called ""Archer MSAs"".  I skipped over that because I never had an Archer MSA.  I found out in August that the real name of Form 8853 is ""Archer MSAs and Long-Term Care Insurance Contracts"".  Oops!  I was supposed to report a Long-Term Care Insurance reimbursement of roughly $38,000, and the H&R Block software had led me right past that form because the full name of the form was not on the long list of forms that it asked me whether I should prepare.  Fortunately, on triple-checking, including a careful inspection of everything sent to me about long-term care insurance, I found reference to Form 8853, which I was supposed to file to match the forms reported by the insurance company.  Apparently, TurboTax asks whether one has a Long-Term Care Insurance Contract, and if yes, leads the taxpayer to Form 8853. Not good, H&R Block!

2.  H&R Block advertises that if one uses this software, one can get a rebate in the form of an amazon.com gift card that, as a percentage of the IRS refund, could be several hundred dollars in value.  However, when I tried to get the card, I found a long series of forms to fill out, one of which certified that I had read a privacy agreement of at least ten pages of fine print.  I can't say for certain, but it looked like I was agreeing to let Block give my personal information to any financial firm that paid H&R Block for it.  So I decided to forego my hundreds of dollars of free stuff on amazon.",Lazy designers of tax preparation software can get you into trouble.

I then had switched from Turbo tax because of some prices-setting issues they have apparently resolved since then. For consistency this year I used the H&R Deluxe and ordered an extra state this time because I need to file in 2 states. I used the download version, here are the results:

  Good Part: Everything from last year imported quite easily, partly because I used the same computer. Download, install, and getting started, were all simple. I was even able to do an import from my Quicken 2013 software that I still use, and that was a pleasant surprise, though not very helpful because most items had to be checked and manually entered.  Features I like include the promise audit support, the ability to get online help being offered, and reports on how to save money and prepare for next years taxes personalized to you.

  Bad Part: To me, the general flow seemed more choppy than last year. It took longer and I had to check on things more back and forth. And after reading other reviews, I feel the need to check my results again. There were times I put in a lot of info, and my total didn't update on the running bottom line. The state portion turned out to waste a lot of money for me. I have to NR file for 2 states total, and because I was in a hurry and wanted the integration, I used my free state plus AND purchased the other state as an option. I figured that everything previously answered would be easily converted making state simple and quick. But there was a lot of redundancy, I still had to answer a lot and enter more than expected. Also, the cost for the download to do the second state was nearly what I paid for this package on sale, more than if I went to the state site and did it manually. It turned out, in my circumstances, I didn't need to file in EITHER states this particular year. Something the software couldn't indicate before I paid even though they had a lot of facts.
  The Worst Part: Today I am on Amazon looking to see if anyone has the glitch I have. I am unable to get any updated Federal information on this year's return now. Even though I could access my federal results and status for days after filing, today I'm locked out if I don't reload my second state (which makes no sense to me- they are separate forms and filing). Because I can't do that free automatically, for some reason I don't understand, I have to go to the website and get help. And that requires your login information. So at this point, I have spent more than I meant to in time and money and I don't know the status of my submission to IRS. I will take the extra time to get to my info with Block online support, but I won't be happy about it. (I will update this review if my experience gets even worse or if I find out any of this is my fault somehow.) UPDATE: I have amended comments above to best reflect my final position, I had to get help on HR chat which stops being 24hours before April ends! After about 20 minutes on chat, I was able to reinstall the state I paid for with a new code they gave me.
If you are on here looking for help like I did here are some final hints- save, back up and print more than you usually would. If you need help, online chat hours are posted on HR website- that is how I got help with missing state software. Finally if you have a choice now and later, use another product.

The fields on the state form are read only and you can't manually input it.

After waiting over 35 minutes to chat with support and then chatting with them for 45 minutes, they insisted that even though the state forms have a field for your spouses information that it is not required, which i do not really believe.

Ultimately i'll wind up needing to fill out state tax forms by hand using the numbers generated by the software.

It seems they should either fix this bug and import your spouse's info from the federal return to your state return, or make it so you can make edits on the state forms to manually input the information.",Bugs with married filing jointly - info not input in to state return.

26597,2,H&R Block,54.0,"04 2, 2016","I went with H&R last year when TurboTax decided to insult all of their loyal users by removing features from their products (and charged the same price).  Now I regret the decision.  Here are my issues:

(1)  Joint vs. separate filing for married people:  It tells you to do it both ways.  Gee, thanks for the help.  If H&R did this the right way, they'd have you create a separate return for each spouse - and then have a utility to combine those returns into a joint return for the comparison.  All the data would already be there.  They could hire a computer science student for the summer to do this.

Incidentally, although H&R tells you that your best method is usually to file jointly, this is not always the case fro federal taxes ... and if you live in a state that severely penalizes you for filing jointly (such as my state OH), it is very bad advice.

(2)  Taxable portion of state refund from last year:  H&R tells me to download the instructions and calculate this myself.  Really?  I imported my 2014 return in which I also used H&R.  They should be able to compute this for me.  TurboTax always did.

(3)  If you have stock or mutual fund dividends that include U.S. obligations (treasuries, bonds), the portion from these obligations is typically exempt from state taxes.  H&R tells you to enter the percentage of your dividends from U.S. obligations.  This works fine if you hold only one mutual fund.  But if you get a single 1099 for an account with multiple funds, you'll have to do a bunch of math on your own to get the correct percentage.  This entry should be a dollar value - not percentage.

(4)  IRAs - If you opened one, added money to one, withdrew funds from one and/or recharacterized one, you'll be adding info in up to 3 separate places during the interview.  Why can't they handle this as a single topic? I don't know.  But you really need to know what the outcome is supposed to be before you go in, because some of the questions are nebulous ... and some are redundant.

(5)  Schedule E - If you have to file Schedule E because you receive royalties or rent, you'll want to fill it out yourself using the ""forms"" option.  The interview is severely lacking and you'll miss deductions that you deserve.  It would have cost me a lot of money this year.  You shouldn't have to download the instructions for Schedule E from the IRS website and become a Schedule E expert (that's what the software is supposed to do), but it's in your best interest to do so.  This is an H&R major fail.

(6)  E-file:  It worked ok, but why it can't remember my banking info from last year (when I also e-filed) is beyond me.

I'm done with it.  TurboTax made a big misstep last year - and H&R had a chance to make major inroads.  Well, you need a solid product to do that.  This is not it.  I'll tuck my tail and go back to TurboTax next year.",It's not good

This program requires you to download Interested, dividends, and 1099-R separately.  TurboTax downloads everything together.  I didn't notice the ""import"" for the 1099-R first time thru so my completed tax form was all messed up.  Finally realized HR had not included it in the download from Fidelity.

This is unTrue - there is no online chat available. So, do not buy this product if you need help filing your taxes. Also, the ""Deluxe plus State"" includes one state. If you need to complete another state (if you moved or work in one state and live in another,"" the cost is an additional $39.95. Ouch! The cost of the software is $29.95, and then H & R Block hits you with a $39.95 charge for another state AFTER you have entered all your data - which is kind of unethical. H & R Block should be upfront and say at the beginning that you will be charged $39.95/state in addition to the $29.95 software cost if you have to file more than one state return. Then, there is an additional charge of $19.95 to e-file state returns - another H & R Block gotcha.

Example 1: And this is the most glaring. In the interview, the product does not even ask about whether you have health insurance until it gets to the penalty section at the end and the default is NO, so that the running total about how how much you owe, includes a penalty, until you actually complete the return. Example 2: When you enter your SSA-1099 info, it doesn't ask about Medicare Part B, so you have to remember that yourself when you itemize deductions later. Example 3: A lot of stuff does get transferred automatically from the FED to state interview, like stuff that is taxed differently by the FEDs and state. In addition, your deduction for state income tax gets deducted from your itemized deduction as it moves from one place to another. Not so with long term health care insurance, which is a deduction on my federal return but applied to a credit in my state and has to be entered manually in both places. To adjust the state itemized deduction, it tells you that you actually have to go outside to a worksheet in the state instructions to properly make the adjustment.

The program has already had quite a few updates to forms, and it asks if you want to restart t apply them. I updated it once, and it only restarted the program. The next time it wanted to update, it restarted my whole computer with no way to stop it. I had some unsaved documents open that prompted me to save them, but the program actually closed the save as dialogue while I was in the middle of it! I then tried to nuke it via Task Manager, but that wouldn't open as well. It didn't even trigger the Windows 7 ""Cancel shutdown screen"", it just closed everything on it's own and did a restart. No program should do this, let alone your unsuspecting tax program. And why the hell does it keep having updates available, updates that need a full system restarts?

Frankly, I don't feel certain of my state taxes after using this either. I know TurboTax has ethics problems, but their product has a slightly better user interface and confidence that things are going as they should. Plus, it's an extra $20 to e-file Vermont state taxes and it this version does NOT include the IN-152 Underpayment forms so it can't even tell you with certainty how much you will really owe.

On HRBlock.com I can access all my previous tax returns from any device; with the desktop version, I can export a specific file that only this software can read, meaning if I use multiple computers (and can't do mobile) I have to install this on each one.

I am sorely disappointed in HRBlock. I have used them for multiple years for my taxes and assumed this would provide the same convenience their website does. It does not. It's 2016; why can a piece of desktop software not access a web server to sync information? The main reason I used HRBlock is because they had all my previous information and kept it for future reference; if this doesn't allow me the same functionality, then next year I have no reason to choose HRBlock again.

If I was able, I would return this product without hesitation.",Use their website; don't buy this. It looks like it's from 2003 and has only had the tax details updated.

The Business package is used for some family Trusts I manage and these Trusts hold actively managed investment accounts, each with over 80 securities transactions to report on Schedule D.  My biggest beef with the software is no support for importing data to Form 8949 in order to populate Schedule D on a Form 1041 Trust return.  So one has to either spend a month of Sundays manually keying in the data to TaxCut, or go pay a third party service where you can actually upload trading data you can download from your Financial institution to populate the Form 8949s and a Schedule D.  Then you get to manually reconcile the totals from the third-party provided Schedule D in TaxCut software so you can proceed to file it all on paper (I've filed paper Trust returns of 90+ pages with all this crap).  A very unsatisfying experience either way.

The online forums for this package are full of requests to address this problem and others, but nothing ever ever seems to be addressed or improved.  They clearly don't want to make their DIY products better.  They want to drive you to hire them to do your return.

I'm one of the fortunate ones who hasn't had insurmountable problems installing the software on my Windows 7 computer, but I wish this company would listen to their customers who, year-after-year-after year post requests to fix the same serious shortcomings with the product, yet never ever do it.

Not only that, it costs more and to use it I would have to re-key everything all over again and then pay hefty fees for filing.  The only reason I give it 2 stars is the software is easy to use but I am very disappointed that the help screens tell you how to fix the error message only to get trapped into another loop of error messages and then after an hour in a chat session the tech finally finds out this feature does not work and then another thirty minutes on the phone to find out they cannot give me a credit to the online version and I need to request a refund through Amazon and if that fails, then write to them and maybe they can do something like a credit for next year!",NO E-FILE CAPABILITY IF YOUR EMPLOYER IS FOREIGN COUNTRY
26751,2,HRBB9,81.32,"02 18, 2014","Deluxe + State H&R Block.  Installation worked fine on 2 machines in 2012.

I was able to installed 2013 Delux + State H&R software on one computer.  When attempting to install software on second machine(H&R advertises that you can do that), the unlock code was never accepted.  Try zero then ""oh"".  Their email used capital letters for the unlock code.  The verify code on line used small case letters.  Sharp people never use one or zero, no letters O or L.

I needed phone help:  No one answered on Presidents Day or even announced they were closed for the holiday-45 minutes lost.  Tuesday 18 February, I spent over 2 hours mostly on hold.  No music, just words for H&R sales people.  First person did not understand how the windows software and H&R installed in tandem.  She wanted to resell the software, but I did not want double billing.  After 45 minutes with her, she transferred me to a second person (another 30 minute wait).  When #2 could not help, she said she would forward me to the ""digital department"".  After 30 minutes on hold, #3 answer and had not heard of the digital department.  She understood the start button and how to begin the CD again.  I knew she was sharper.  I could tell a supervisor was counseling her.  Noone wanted to share their names.

""Just enter your activation code"" was suggested; a real code but the software was not built for this code for 2013. ""I will give you an over ride code"", I knew I needed this but that code would not work.  I also asked for help install Apple MAC software-my fall back choice, again I was not helped.  Wasted 6 hours so far.  IRS estimated I could have completed 3 forms by hand in about 2 hrs each.

It must be really hard for these phone people to help when the software is flawed.

Buyer beware of H&R Block's software this year.  If you wait until the last minute, they might have a software fix or some better training for their staff.  Good luck.  Hope it all works better for you.

***Update,  After I wrote this review, H&R forwarded a special link by E-Mail.  That link was for a free copy of 2013 that I could load to my computer.  It worked.  Hope that the ""help people"" have the authority and knowlege to help others now.",H&R Software issues in 2013
26752,2,HRBB9,81.32,"02 17, 2014","I've used this software for about 10 years.  Though I would normally give it only 3 stars because it doesn't do much to clarify the IRS Tax Code, but it does do most of the math for your.  In many cases I still have to dig through IRS Instructions to figure out what I'm supposed to enter.  I keep using it year after year because I guess I'm a masochist.

As to why I gave it two stars...

I probably should have given it only one star because this really could be disastrous.
Anyway, when I finished my taxes I discover that I nearly underpaid last year.  So decided to update my W4.  I usually don't touch it because I have no idea what the allowances mean other than that it will increase or decrease my withholding.  So, I decided to wade through the planner part of the software when I was done with my taxes  I'd never used it before.  It was basically like doing your taxes again with guesses for this year, but the result this time would be a single digit number plus an amount for a few dollars to put in your W-4.  It also tells you about how much Income Tax needs to be taken out of your paycheck each paycheck.

I wasn't too surprised that it said I needed to take an additional $100 out each pay period.  But the allowance number it came up with was 2 MORE than what I was currently withholding.  The additional withholding amount was only $10  I admit that I find how this number is achieved is a great mystery, but I'm pretty sure (after I looked it up today) that the higher that number the the LESS they take out!  Just to double check, I found a web site ([...]) that explains how to work backward from the magic number to get what's really being taken out.  The amount for me would have been $200 LESS than I currently take out each paycheck!  I tried the magic number calculators on the IRS web site as well as on H&R Block's own web site to see if they gave me something different.  Each said I needed to take about the same amount as the software did but they each gave me a allowance number 2 less than was currently on my W4.

So, Beware!  If you blindly follow what it tells you to do, you can end up paying a huge penalty next year!  I really hope the rest of the software is more reliable.

I haven't tried any other software, but I think I will next year.

Other attributes...  It has a pretty green icon.",Gets job done. But beware! The planner will really screw up your W-4.
26753,2,HRBB9,81.32,"02 10, 2014","I've been using H&R Block for ~10 years (when it was TaxCut).  I decided to switch to the online version this year (2013 taxes).  So in some ways these comments are specific to the Online version, but it does speak to the shift in quality I've been use to.  Here were the issues:

* Price doubled - from $29 to $67 (2013), but you're led to believe it's far cheaper.

* I was told I could file 5 returns with the online subscription - but really only one.

* Each time I tried to login (Firefox or Chrome), I'd get an account/password error - and if I made it by that error I would get an unrecognized security question error. (I have case numbers to document this).

* It looks like it wipes your IL state taxes entered from W2 during Federal return when you transition to file the State return.

26755,2,HRBB9,81.32,"02 8, 2014","I always have to file two state returns because I live in a different state than I work in.  There is always a fee to download the 2nd state-no big deal.  This year it is a SHOCKING $39.99 to buy a second state download... AND it said it won't handle non-resident returns.  So basically it is worthless to me as well as being overpriced.
If you use the online version it is only $14.99 for the additional state... and it understands non-resident.  So be forewarned- don't waste your time and money starting your return on this only to have to go and do it all over on the online site.
Other than the fact that I couldn't use the software and had to start completely from scratch.... it was fine.  I've always found that H&R Block and TurboTax are essentially identical and I still find that to be True.  Yet TT for some reason always costs more.  So I'm not anti H&R block- but hope to save anyone else in my same- admittedly non-standard- situation the same irritation I just experienced.",DO NOT USE IF YOU NEED MORE THAN ONE STATE!!

I did not have enough data to do my taxes at that time, so I downloaded it and just left it on my computer.  I started preparing my taxes on 4 Feb.  I discovered I needed an activation code they said wan on the e-mail confirming the order.  Of course I did not save that.  They said they would provide the code on line.  I contacted H&R  on line. We were connected on line immediately.  It said I was number 98 in line.  Over 2 hours later I got my activation code.  When I got started again on my taxes I got a window that said for $20 I could upgrade to include state.  I did not want to spend hours on line again, so I ordered it.  They charged me $5.99 to let me download it.  It would have been $10.00 to get a CD in the mailt. Like a lot of modern business, beware of the fine print.

I've tried everything including calling H&R block and reinstalling etc - all to no avail.  Aaaarrrggghhh!,Once AGAIN this software does not work..
26763,2,HRBB9,81.32,"01 17, 2014","So, I'm a long time H&R Block Tax software customer.  I've always been happy with the product, and the price - way less than TurboTax or a human.  That said, I just battled a frustrating install process and finally figured out the problem.  After installing 2013, the first order of business was to download a software update (Federal).  The update downloaded, and then failed during update.  The software went into this cycle of prompting for an update, failing to install it (would get to about 80% and then roll back), then prompting for an update again.  After cycling through this a few times and failing, I uninstalled 2013, re-installed, and proceeded to battle the same issue.

After an hour of frustration I thought to myself, I wonder if having H&R Block 2012 on my machine is causing a problem?  So, I uninstalled 2012, uninstalled 2013, then re-installed 2013 and voila, problem solved.  So, if any of you out there have 2012 installed (or potentially any other version), and you are having install/update problems - I would remove previous versions first!

Software conflicts happen, I get it.  The reason for the two-star review is because the conflict isn't addressed AT ALL by the 2013 software.  The 2013 software should have checked for previous versions during install and prompted for removal.  At minimum, a warning or disclaimer should have been provided with the product detailing this as part of the install instructions.  At BARE MINIMUM, they would have posted something about this on their online support page.  Considering they left me to battle this for an hour before eventually solving the problem on my own, I'm not real thrilled with them to start this year's tax season.  This is disappointing because I generally start my taxes with a feeling of happiness, euphoria really - and they took this feeling of joy away from me...

Other comments are also correct about the unnecessary up-sell attempt to premium - before they even know if you NEED it.  If you need to file a state return be sure to pay the extra $$$ now and buy this version with state included (vs. Deluxe without state) - they charge more to bolt it on within the software.","Long-time customer, not happy about this program's install process - READ if you have H&R Block 2012 already installed!"
